Rashad",2017,Accounting standards for prepaid commodity swaps did not exist until 2003. This absence of regulation gave Enron the opportunity to have its own homemade accounting. Two actions facilitated this task for Enron: (a) The Securities and Exchange Commission granted Enron in January 1992 a unilateral privilege to use mark-to-market valuation for energy contracts. This private communication was made at a time when viable markets did not exist. (b) Big banks colluded with Enron’s top executives to design structured finance contracts that allowed Enron to report at least US$8.7 billion of loans as cash flow from operations. Seventy-one percent of the cash flow from operations reported in the last 5 years of Enron’s existence came from these loans. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup effectively made it easy for Enron to carry out this fraud. The two banks established their own special purpose entities to give these loans the appearance of legitimate trade transactions using prepaid commodity forwards and swaps. This article outlines some of the schemes that the two banks devised to help Enron appear financially healthy when in reality it was near bankruptcy for years.,Crossref,99.2063492063492,10.1177/0148558x17724249,https://doi.org/10.1177/0148558x17724249,"Journal of Accounting, Auditing &amp; Finance","Abdel-Khalik, A.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to bridge this demand-supply gap, with potential applications ranging from full automation to integrated AI-human decision-making. This study evaluates the economic feasibility of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into mammography screening within healthcare settings, considering full or partial integration. To evaluate the economic viability, we employ an optimization model specifically designed to minimize mammography screening costs. This model considers three distinct approaches when interpreting mammograms: automation strategy utilizing AI exclusively, delegation strategy involving the selective allocation of tasks between radiologists and AI, and the expert-alone strategy relying solely on radiologist decisions. Our findings underscore the significance of disease prevalence in relation to the trade-off between costs associated with false positives (e.g., follow-up expenses) and false negatives (e.g., litigation costs stemming from missed diagnoses) in shaping the AI strategy for healthcare organizations. We backtest our approach using data from an AI contest in which participants aimed to match or surpass radiologists’ performance in assessing screening mammograms for women. The contest data supports the optimality of the delegation strategy, potentially leading to cost savings of 17.5% to 30.1% compared to relying solely on human experts.

This paper explores how diverse bioinformatics tasks, including differential expression analysis, network inference, and somatic mutation calling, can be reframed as binary classification tasks, thereby providing a unifying framework for their analysis. Traditional single-method approaches often fail to generalize across datasets due to differences in data distributions, noise levels, and underlying biological contexts. Ensemble learning, particularly unsupervised ensemble approaches, emerges as a compelling solution by integrating predictions from multiple algorithms to leverage their strengths and mitigate weaknesses. This review focuses on the principles and recent advancements in ensemble learning, with a particular emphasis on unsupervised ensemble methods. These approaches demonstrate their ability to address critical challenges in bioinformatics, such as the lack of labeled data and the integration of predictions from algorithms operating on different scales. Overall, this paper highlights the transformative potential of ensemble learning in advancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across diverse bioinformatics applications.",Crossref,100.0,10.3390/math13030420,https://doi.org/10.3390/math13030420,Mathematics,"Ahsen, M.

Yet, such models face challenges: poor generalization and limited labeled data. Results To overcome these difficulties in binary classification tasks, we developed the Method for Optimal Classification by Aggregation (MOCA) algorithm, which addresses the problem of generalization by virtue of being an ensemble learning method and can be used in problems with limited or no labeled data. We developed both an unsupervised (uMOCA) and a supervised (sMOCA) variant of MOCA. For uMOCA, we show how to infer the MOCA weights in an unsupervised way, which are optimal under the assumption of class-conditioned independent classifier predictions. When it is possible to use labels, sMOCA uses empirically computed MOCA weights. We demonstrate the performance of uMOCA and sMOCA using simulated data as well as actual data previously used in Dialogue on Reverse Engineering and Methods (DREAM) challenges. We also propose an application of sMOCA for transfer learning where we use pre-trained computational models from a domain where labeled data are abundant and apply them to a different domain with less abundant labeled data.

An Empirical Investigation,"Ahsen, Mehmet",2022,"The rise of the sharing economy has disrupted traditional industries and has had many unforeseen societal impacts. This has sparked policy debates on whether and how the sharing economy should be regulated to promote the healthy growth of such markets. In this research, we examine the impact of platform self-regulations in the context of the home-sharing market. Using policy changes that reduce the number of Airbnb listings, we empirically test the impact of platform self-regulations on crime rates. Our results suggest that a reduction in Airbnb listings resulting from platform self-regulations leads to a reduction in crime. We further study the impact of these policy changes on different types of crime and find that these self-regulations lead to a reduction in incidents of crime such as assault, robbery, and burglary but an increase in theft incidents. In addition, we find that the impact of these policies varies based on the neighborhood’s characteristics, such as income, housing price, and population. This research contributes to our understanding of the societal impacts of the sharing economy and the impact of platform self-regulation.

Design EVs were isolated with differential ultracentrifugation and integrated nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement arrays (nanoDLD) and quality assessed by electron microscopy, immunoblotting, nanoparticle tracking and deconvolution analysis. Genome-wide sequencing of the largely unexplored small exRNA landscape, including unannotated transcripts, identified and reproducibly quantified small RNA clusters (smRCs). Their key genomic features were delineated across biospecimens and EV isolation techniques in prostate cancer and HCC. Three independent exRNA cancer datasets with a total of 479 samples from 375 patients, including longitudinal samples, were used for this study.

External validation studies provide an initial assessment of how promising AI algorithms perform in different practice settings. Objective To externally validate an ensemble deep-learning model using data from a high-volume, distributed screening program of an academic health system with a diverse patient population. Design, Setting, and Participants In this diagnostic study, an ensemble learning method, which reweights outputs of the 11 highest-performing individual AI models from the Digital Mammography Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) Mammography Challenge, was used to predict the cancer status of an individual using a standard set of screening mammography images. This study was conducted using retrospective patient data collected between 2010 and 2020 from women aged 40 years and older who underwent a routine breast screening examination and participated in the Athena Breast Health Network at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Main Outcomes and Measures Performance of the challenge ensemble method (CEM) and the CEM combined with radiologist assessment (CEM+R) were compared with diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancers within a year of the screening examination using performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results Evaluated on 37 317 examinations from 26 817 women (mean [SD] age, 58.4 [11.5] years), individual model AUROC estimates ranged from 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75-0.79) to 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81-0.85). The CEM model achieved an AUROC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84-0.87) in the UCLA cohort, lower than the performance achieved in the Kaiser Permanente Washington (AUROC, 0.90) and Karolinska Institute (AUROC, 0.92) cohorts. The CEM+R model achieved a sensitivity (0.813 [95% CI, 0.781-0.843] vs 0.826 [95% CI, 0.795-0.856]; P = .20) and specificity (0.925 [95% CI, 0.916-0.934] vs 0.930 [95% CI, 0.929-0.932]; P = .18) similar to the radiologist performance. The CEM+R model had significantly lower sensitivity (0.596 [95% CI, 0.466-0.717] vs 0.850 [95% CI, 0.766-0.923]; P &amp;lt; .001) and specificity (0.803 [95% CI, 0.734-0.861] vs 0.945 [95% CI, 0.936-0.954]; P &amp;lt; .001) than the radiologist in women with a prior history of breast cancer and Hispanic women (0.894 [95% CI, 0.873-0.910] vs 0.926 [95% CI, 0.919-0.933]; P = .004). Conclusions and Relevance This study found that the high performance of an ensemble deep-learning model for automated screening mammography interpretation did not generalize to a more diverse screening cohort, suggesting that the model experienced underspecification.

Studies indicate that the expression (or re-expression) of CTAs within the MAGE-A family is common in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no systematic characterization has yet been reported. The aim of this study is to perform a comprehensive profile of CTA de-regulation in HCC and experimentally evaluate the role of MAGEA3 as a driver of HCC progression. The transcriptomic analysis of 44 multi-regionally sampled HCCs from 12 patients identified high intra-tumor heterogeneity of CTAs. In addition, a subset of CTAs was significantly overexpressed in histologically poorly differentiated regions. Further analysis of CTAs in larger patient cohorts revealed high CTA expression related to worse overall survival and several other markers of poor prognosis. Functional analysis of MAGEA3 was performed in human HCC cell lines by gene silencing and in a genetic mouse model by overexpression of MAGEA3 in the liver.

We present a proof-of-concept for a seizure detection system that is sensitive, automated, patient-specific, and tunable to maximise sensitivity while minimizing human annotation times. The system uses custom data preparation methods, deep learning analytics and electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Scalp EEG data of 365 patients containing 171,745 s ictal and 2,185,864 s interictal samples obtained from clinical monitoring systems were analysed as part of a crowdsourced artificial intelligence (AI) challenge. Participants were tasked to develop an ictal/interictal classifier with high sensitivity and low false alarm rates. We built a challenge platform that prevented participants from downloading or directly accessing the data while allowing crowdsourced model development.
The automatic detection system achieved tunable sensitivities between 75.00% and 91.60% allowing a reduction in the amount of raw EEG data to be reviewed by a human annotator by factors between 142x, and 22x respectively. The algorithm enables instantaneous reviewer-managed optimization of the balance between sensitivity and the amount of raw EEG data to be reviewed.
This study demonstrates the utility of deep learning for patient-specific seizure detection in EEG data. Furthermore, deep learning in combination with a human reviewer can provide the basis for an assistive data labelling system lowering the time of manual review while maintaining human expert annotation performance.

In this work, we designed and deployed a large-scale experiment (N = 3,423) on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate the effects of AI explanations on people's perceptions in the context of comprehending radiology reports. We created four groups based on two factors—the extent of explanations for the prediction (High vs. Low Transparency) and the model performance (Good vs. Weak AI Model)—and randomly assigned participants to one of the four conditions. Participants were instructed to classify a radiology report as describing a normal or abnormal finding, followed by completing a post-study survey to indicate their perceptions of the AI tool. We found that revealing model performance information can promote people's trust and perceived usefulness of system outputs, while providing local explanations for the rationale of a prediction can promote understandability but not necessarily trust. We also found that when model performance is low, the more information the AI system discloses, the less people would trust the system. Lastly, whether human agrees with AI predictions or not and whether the AI prediction is correct or not could also influence the effect of AI explanations. We conclude this paper by discussing implications for designing AI systems for healthcare consumers to interpret diagnostic report.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),95.6043956043956,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10916-021-01743-6,"Z Zhang, Y Genc, D Wang, ME Ahsen, X Fan - Journal of Medical Systems, 2021 - Springer","Zhang, Z., Genc, Y., Wang, D., Ahsen, M., & Fan, X.

Two important obstacles, however, may limit the unraveling of the full potential of machine learning in these fields: the lack of generalization of the resulting models and the limited number of labeled data sets in some applications. To address these important problems, we developed an unsupervised ensemble algorithm called strategy for unsupervised multiple method aggregation (SUMMA). By virtue of being an ensemble method, SUMMA is more robust to generalization than the predictions it combines. By virtue of being unsupervised, SUMMA does not require labeled data. SUMMA receives as input predictions from a diversity of models and estimates their classification performance even when labeled data are unavailable. It then uses these performance estimates to combine these different predictions into an ensemble model. SUMMA can be applied to a variety of binary classification problems in bioinformatics including but not limited to gene network inference, cancer diagnostics, drug response prediction, somatic mutation, and differential expression calling.

This can be explained mechanistically by the sequential activation of transcription factors in time in the gene regulatory network.

Regional expression of passenger mutations dominantly recruits adaptive responses as opposed to hepatitis B virus and cancer-testis antigens. We detect different clonal expansion of the adaptive immune system in distant regions of the same tumor. An ITH-based gene signature improves single-biopsy patient survival predictions and an expression survey of 38,553 single cells across 7 regions of 2 patients further reveals heterogeneity in liver cancer.

Although very informative, in standard scRNAseq experiments, the spatial organization of the cells in the tissue of origin is lost. Conversely, spatial RNA-seq technologies designed to maintain cell localization have limited throughput and gene coverage. Mapping scRNAseq to genes with spatial information increases coverage while providing spatial location. However, methods to perform such mapping have not yet been benchmarked. To fill this gap, we organized the DREAM Single-Cell Transcriptomics challenge focused on the spatial reconstruction of cells from the Drosophila embryo from scRNAseq data, leveraging as silver standard, genes with in situ hybridization data from the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project reference atlas. The 34 participating teams used diverse algorithms for gene selection and location prediction, while being able to correctly localize clusters of cells. Selection of predictor genes was essential for this task. Predictor genes showed a relatively high expression entropy, high spatial clustering and included prominent developmental genes such as gap and pair-rule genes and tissue markers. Application of the top 10 methods to a zebra fish embryo dataset yielded similar performance and statistical properties of the selected genes than in the Drosophila data.

We examine the design and value of a bias-aware linear classification algorithm that accounts for bias in input data, using breast cancer diagnosis as our specific setting. In this context, a referring physician makes a follow-up recommendation to a patient based on two inputs: the patient’s clinical-risk information and the radiologist’s mammogram assessment. Critically, the radiologist’s assessment could be biased by the clinical-risk information, which in turn can negatively affect the referring physician’s performance. Thus, a bias-aware algorithm has the potential to be of significant value if integrated into a clinical decision support system used by the referring physician. We develop and show that a bias-aware algorithm can eliminate the adverse impact of bias if the error in the mammogram assessment due to radiologist’s bias has no variance. On the other hand, in the presence of error variance, the adverse impact of bias can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by the bias-aware algorithm. The bias-aware algorithm assigns less (more) weight to the clinical-risk information (radiologist’s mammogram assessment) when the mean error increases (decreases), but the reverse happens when the error variance increases. Using point estimates obtained from mammography practice and the medical literature, we show that the bias-aware algorithm can significantly improve the expected patient life years or the accuracy of decisions based on mammography.

We sought to identify a robust molecular signature that can accurately classify risk of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer patients. 86 tumors matched for age and race, and evenly distributed between lymph node-positive and lymph node-negative cases, were selected as a training cohort. Genomic micro-RNA expression was profiled for each sample to serve as the predictive feature matrix. An independent set of 28 tumor samples was collected and similarly characterized to serve as a test cohort. A feature selection algorithm was designed for applications where the number of samples is far smaller than the number of measured features per sample. A predictive miRNA expression signature was developed using this algorithm, which was then used to predict the metastatic status of the independent test cohort. A weighted classifier, using 18 micro-RNAs, achieved 100% accuracy on the training cohort. When applied to the testing cohort, the classifier correctly predicted 90% of node-positive cases, and 80% of node-negative cases (FDR = 6.25%). Results indicate that the evaluation of the quantitative sparse-feature classifier proposed here in clinical trials may lead to significant improvement in the prediction of lymphatic metastases in endometrial cancer patients.",Semantic Scholar ,100.0,10.1186/s12864-017-3604-y,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c6c54c86bee6de1b8084352228276f0ff261ae9,BMC Genomics,"Ahsen, M., Boren, T., Singh, N., Misganaw, B., Mutch, D., Moore, K., Backes, F., McCourt, C., Lea, J., Miller, D., & others, .

On the one hand, risk profile information is informative and can improve radiologists’ performance, but on the other hand, it may impair their judgment by introducing biases in mammography interpretation. Therefore, it is important to assess whether and when profile information use translates into improved outcomes. We model the use of profile information in mammography, using a decision theoretic approach and explore the value of profile information using three process design choices: mammography only, unbiased, and biased reading. We estimate the parameters of our model using clinical data and find that using profile information along with the mammography information can achieve a better performance than not using the profile information. However, the better performance is contingent on the weight assigned to the profile information as well as the extent of bias due to profile information. Translating our findings into clinical practice would require properly designed experiments aiming to quantify the effect of the timing and the use of profile information on performance while accounting for radiologist and patient characteristics. When conducting an experiment is not feasible, a uniform operational sequence for interpreting mammograms and related guidelines may be a useful starting point to improve the quality of mammography operations.",Crossref,98.64864864864865,10.1111/poms.12679,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12679,Production and Operations Management,"Ayvaci, M., Ahsen, M., Raghunathan, S., & Gharibi, Z.

Front-line therapy for ovarian cancer is platinum-based chemotherapy. However, the response of patients is highly nonuniform. The TCGA database of serous ovarian carcinomas shows that ~10% of patients respond poorly to platinum-based chemotherapy, with tumors relapsing in seven months or less. Another 10% or so enjoy disease-free survival of three years or more. The objective of the present research is to identify a small number of highly predictive biomarkers that can distinguish between the two extreme responders and then extrapolate to all patients. This is achieved using the lone star algorithm that is specifically developed for biological applications. Using this algorithm, we are able to identify biomarker panels of 25 genes (of 12,000 genes) that can be used to classify patients into one of the three groups: super responders, medium responders, and nonresponders. We are also able to determine a discriminant function that can divide the entire patient population into two classes, such that one group has a clear survival advantage over the other. These biomarkers are developed using the TCGA Agilent platform data and cross-validated on the TCGA Affymetrix platform data, as well as entirely independent data from Tothill et al.

Whereas the primary policy tool used by the FDA to oversee drug quality is recurring plant inspections, there are fewer similar tools used by the FDA to reduce drug shortages. In an effort to better understand the pernicious public health problem of drug shortages and the role of the FDA in reducing shortages, the U.S. Congress tasked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study this problem. A key conclusion in the GAO report is that when the FDA gives their most unfavorable plant inspection outcome, those plants develop shortages soon thereafter, a possible sign of onerous FDA corrective actions that may come at the cost of reliable drug supplies. We examine whether these most unfavorable FDA inspection outcomes help or hinder drug shortages, using a rigorous econometric approach. Methodology/results: We employ instrumental variable (IV) analysis to conduct a verification of this GAO report. We examine the relationship between the most unfavorable inspection outcome given by the FDA, an official action indicated (OAI), and future drug shortage risks. We find that, contrary to the GAO report, OAI inspection outcomes lead to reduced shortage risks. Robustness checks give consistent results. In posthoc analyses, we continue to leverage instrumental variable analyses to explore the impact of the other inspection outcomes, as well as merely receiving an inspection, on shortage risks. We find evidence of an incrementally beneficial relationship between inspection outcome severity and shortage risk reduction. Managerial implications: The FDA hesitates to issue OAI outcomes, doing so at an exceedingly low rate. Our results indicate that if the GAO report created any organizational hesitancy on the part of the FDA to issue OAIs out of a concern that they may lead to shortages, this hesitancy appears to be unwarranted.

The drugs produced by the operations of this industry, which include all activities from scientific innovation to supply chain management, play an important role in the health and well-being of millions of people around the world (OECD 2025). Recent disruptions, especially the COVID-19 pandemic, exposed critical limitations in global pharmaceutical operations, spurring widespread concern (Shih 2020). In the U.S., the Biden Administration deemed pharmaceuticals one of four critical national supply chains, the others being semiconductors, large capacity batteries, and minerals (White House 2021). Further, Congress mandated a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) focused on securing the nation's medical product supply chains against quality and supply disruptions (NASEM 2022). Despite the recognition of its importance, operational challenges in this industry remain prevalent. Drug shortages reached a record high in 2024 (ASHP 2024), and their duration has been increasing (USP 2024). Further, quality issues remain common (e.g., Callahan et al. 2024), and the drug recall trend continues to climb (Ghijs et al. 2024).

The opacity and complexity of pharmaceutical operations are two factors driving the continued quality and resilience issues. As Figure 1 depicts, much of the complexity in the U.S. pharmaceuticals industry stems from intermediaries and payors, who are often vertically integrated and powerful, and who can create and benefit from opacity. Additional complexity comes from the roles of powerful regulators, who oversee, among other things, approvals to produce drugs and ongoing drug quality and safety. We discuss many of these forms of opacity and complexity in detail in the next section.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1002/joom.1365,"G Anand, GP Ball, JV Gray, UK Mukherjee - Journal of Operations …, 2025 - dl.acm.org","Anand, G., Ball, G., Gray, J., & Mukherjee, U.

We study these phenomena in the context of product recalls in pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Based on text analysis of recall documents, recalls are divided into process related and design related to represent slip-up failures and knowledge gap failures. We further study how innovation capabilities, represented by accumulated stocks of patents and lagged research and development (R&D) intensity, impact learning from both types of failures. We test our hypotheses using negative binomial generalized linear models to analyze longitudinal data for 108 publicly traded U.S. firms over 2000–2016 comprising 7,984 recalls. Results indicate that design-related recalls generate learning to a greater extent than process-related recalls, and that accumulated patents and lagged R&D intensity enhance learning from design-related recalls. These findings suggest that the learning mechanisms invoked by failures are concentrated more on knowledge gap failures than slip-up failures, and such learning is impacted by innovation capabilities. Overall, this research extends organizational learning theory by differentiating between learning from different types of failures and extends absorptive capacity theory by incorporating the role of innovation capabilities in enhancing learning from failures. We develop recommendations for learning from slip-up failures by focusing on the cultural and social mechanisms of organizational learning in addition to the technical and structural mechanisms that may mainly impact learning from knowledge gap failures.

Further, this study aims to assess the association of DCs microfoundations with process innovation. Design/methodology/approach The researchers combine primary data collected from 153 manufacturing firms located in five continents using a survey designed for the purpose of this study with archival data downloaded from the Bureau Van Dijk Orbis database and test the hypothesized relationships using structural equation modelling. Findings Results support the contribution of lean operations and lean supply chain practices to the development of DCs microfoundations, which further lead to greater process innovation. Additionally, while a learning-oriented lean culture positively moderates the relationships between both lean operations and lean supply chain practices and DCs microfoundations, an innovation-oriented lean culture only moderates the relationship between lean operations practices and DCs microfoundations. Practical implications This study identifies DCs microfoundations as the key mechanisms for firms implementing lean practices to achieve greater levels of process innovation and the important role played by lean cultures. This study provides direction for managers to put in place DCs through lean implementations, enabling their firms to be ready to respond to challenges and opportunities generated by environmental changes. Originality/value While previous research has confirmed the positive effects of lean practices on efficiency, the role of lean practices and cultures in developing capabilities for reacting to environmental dynamism has received little attention.

Follow‐up observations after our intervention show that the process improvements at the hospital are sustained. We supplement the IBR with quantitative analyses and provide evidence of improvements in health outcomes and satisfaction levels of patients associated with the redesign. These analyses are based on difference‐in‐difference estimations using data from transplant patients, including a control group from other transplant units.

However, deriving benefits from these implementations has proved to be a challenge, and a great deal of variation has been observed in the extent of value generated for client and vendor firms. This research examines the role of co-specialization as a strategy to make the most out of outsourced enterprise systems. The authors develop hypotheses relating resource co-specialization with two indicators of success for implementation of enterprise software: (1) exchange success and (2) firm growth.
The hypotheses are tested using a unique panel data set of 175 firms adopting Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) software, a type of enterprise system used for managing manufacturing and logistics. The authors identify organizational factors that support co-specialization and then examine how co-specialization is associated with enterprise software implementation success, controlling for the endogenous choice to co-specialize.
The empirical results suggest that resource co-specialization is positively associated with implementation success and that the two resource co-specialization pathways that are examined complement each other in providing performance benefits.

A qualitative study of how villagers decide their health care providers in a developing economy,"Anand, Gopesh",2019,"Introduction The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in India in 2005 to address the health needs of under-served populations in rural areas, and to support universal access to care. Despite this initiative, unaccredited informal providers (IPs) often remain patients’ first point of contact, which has led to inconsistencies in treatment, and has compromised the quality of care. Aim To explore the factors that influence patients’ decisions about healthcare providers in rural areas of central India. Methods Nine focus group discussions (FGDs) were held in nine villages in central India. Framework analysis using an inductive approach was used to analyse the data. Results The crosscutting theme across the discussions was not choice but need—the need for affordable and accessible health care regardless of the provider’s qualification. Results highlighted that IPs play a pivotal role in villagers’ lives. Formal healthcare services were accessed infrequently, and mainly when a condition was judged severe or possibly even fatal. Even then, affordability was carefully weighed. Villagers’ distance from formal providers contributed to high cost and low preference of formal providers. When opting for IPs, familiarity and trust were more important to villagers than qualifications. IPs have operated in rural communities in India for a long time and have adapted their services to meet the needs, preferences, social norms, and economic conditions of villagers. Conclusion IPs have captured a niche and are often the first contact point in rural settings even when patients ultimately are diagnosed and treated by trained doctors. Merely tackling the undersupply of qualified doctors is not effective or sufficient to impact on the rural healthcare system: the strong and prevalent influence of IPs needs to be addressed also.",Semantic Scholar ,100.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0220316,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/831b7d8eac2b2ea51cfdc66a8539fe5ffd63520f,PLoS ONE,"Anand, G., Chhajed, D., Shah, S., Atkins, S., & Diwan, V.

The study used maximum likelihood estimation path analysis to simultaneously test the relationships among average surgical volume and risk-adjusted length of stay, cost, and mortality, across all surgical procedures and clinical areas. The results showed that higher average volume per surgeon, computed across all surgical procedures in a hospital, was directly related to lower risk-adjusted length of stay, and indirectly related to lower risk-adjusted cost and mortality. A higher average number of procedures per surgeon may provide greater hospital-specific experience, including interactions among surgical teams and with other areas of the hospital, leading to better overall outcomes.

The 30-day readmission rate for kidney transplant recipients is over 30%. Our research focuses on the relationship between the quality of care delivered during the patient's hospital stay for a kidney transplant, and the patient health outcomes and readmissions related to the transplant.MethodsWe interviewed 20 kidney transplant recipients at a major transplant center in the United States. Findings from these interviews were used to inform the data collection using structured surveys, which were administered to an additional 77 kidney transplant recipients. We used ordinary least squares regression to predict the effects of two dimensions of in-hospital care quality–information consistency and empathetic care delivery–on level of patient anxiety 1 week following discharge. Further, we estimated a logistic regression to predict the effect of anxiety, combined with the two dimensions of in-hospital care quality, on occurrence of 30-day readmissions.ResultsPatient anxiety levels 1 wk after discharge are significantly associated with information consistency and empathetic delivery of care. Patient anxiety 1 wk after discharge is associated with occurrence of 30-d readmissions. The logistic regression model indicates that the risk of getting readmitted is 110% higher for a one unit increase in patient anxiety level 1 wk after discharge. Finally, patient anxiety fully mediates the effects of consistency of information and empathetic care delivery on occurrence of 30-d readmissions (50.96% of the effect is mediated).ConclusionsOur study suggests two ways of preventing readmissions through reduction of postdischarge anxiety: (1) standardizing in-hospital care, so that information received by patients is consistent, and (2) by training caregivers to be more empathetic toward patients during the delivery of this information.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),90.81632653061224,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022480416301044,"A Chandrasekaran, G Anand, L Sharma… - journal of surgical …, 2016 - Elsevier","Chandrasekaran, A., Anand, G., Sharma, L., Pesavanto, T., Hauenstein, M., Nguyen, M., & Moffatt-Bruce, S.

Using longitudinal data, we find plants that obtained certification in the earlier diffusion period (early‐certified plants) tend to have significantly better process compliance than a matched, non‐certified control group of plants. The compliance difference between early‐certified plants and their matched control group is greater than the compliance difference between late‐certified plants and their matched control group. We also find deterioration in process compliance over time after certification. Because we capture longitudinally the first‐order effects of ISO 9000 on process compliance, this study provides a useful baseline for assessing causality in ISO 9000‐performance linkages.

Despite lower sourcing costs, such social irresponsibility can have a severe negative effect on firms because of growing awareness and punishment from consumers toward unethical practices. To study how ethical behavior of suppliers and supplier learning affect a firm׳s sourcing strategy, we analyze a buying firm׳s strategic sourcing decision on supplier selection between unethical and ethical suppliers by considering the risk likelihood and the impact to the firm of unethical events, and the supplier learning. We show that supplier learning matters and that the benefit of high learning rates may outweigh the concerns of unethical behavior or high ethical sourcing cost and so, long-term contracts are optimal. We also show that the firm may prefer a selection policy contingent on the realization of unethical events only when risk is low or impact is high.

The proposed objective functions, to be minimized, represent the total completion time and the outbound trucks’ earliness and tardiness.

The Prophet model successfully predicts time series containing well-known seasonal patterns but performs less effectively on time series exhibiting chaotic patterns. To overcome this, we propose a novel methodology that combines the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique and its noise-assisted variations with the Prophet model. One key property of this methodology is its ability to analyze the seasonality and chaos present in each time series and recommend a suitable forecasting method accordingly. The proposed methodology decomposes chaotic time series into multiple sub-series at various frequencies using EMD and its two noise-assisted extensions: Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and Improved CEEMDAN. Subsequently, models are fitted for each sub-series using the Prophet model, and the resulting forecasts are aggregated to generate a final prediction.

In the second stage, by obtaining market prices, service providers compete on network prices. Finally, the equilibrium solutions are compared with each other by considering the intensity of market competition in price and quality. It is shown that equilibrium never occurs in the case when the smaller service provider has a higher Internet quality than the other (scenario 2) and the more significant service provider offers a higher Internet quality (scenario 4).

In the model, consumers pay a penalty fee if they consume in both periods. In the second period, consumers may be forgetful of their first-period consumption, although the use of consumption tracking can remind them. According to our analysis, the availability of consumption tracking often helps consumers at the expense of the firm; such benefits may be direct, where consumers make use of the technology to avoid penalty fees, or indirect, where the mere availability of consumption tracking forces the firm to lower its penalty fee. If consumers are partially sophisticated regarding their forgetfulness, however, the availability of consumption tracking may instill a false sense of security in that consumers expect to use consumption tracking to avoid penalty fees but ultimately, decide not to bother, making them especially susceptible to penalty fees. In some cases, the availability of consumption tracking may actually compel a firm to impose a penalty fee that would not otherwise be viable, leading to higher profits and lower consumer surplus. As we show, this scenario is attained within an intermediate range of forgetfulness and at a level of (partial) sophistication for which consumers overestimate their demand for the technology.ces.",Semantic Scholar,99.4444444444444,10.1103/w4c6-1r5j,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f32b9c1a9d4f025f6096444ad74bb7bc31752ad7,Physical Review D,"Bao, Y., Landry, P., & Shi, M.

The firm faces twin problems of identifying the right project(s) to prioritize them, and next also motivate the managers to exert effort in implementing the project to successful fruition. The firm’s contract design can incentivize the managers either using a resource-based incentive plan, which offers a reward based on the number of resources invested in the projects, or offering a resource-decoupled incentive plan, which provides a standard reward disregarding the differential amount of resources invested. We consider a set-up where the manager has private information about project quality. During the prioritizing first stage, we allow the manager to lobby for the project by manipulating the signal of the project quality. We show that a resource-decoupled incentive plan impacts the lobbying by encouraging the manager of the higher quality project to manipulate the quality signal more to stand out. Therefore, although a resource-based incentive plan is more efficient in inducing the manager in exerting implementation effort, a resource-decoupled incentive plan may be preferred as it leads to more accurate resource allocation. Thus, allowing lobbying that involves exaggeration may be beneficial by amplifying a firm’s ability to identify high caliber projects.

Prior research suggests stock price incentives provide a positive “reward effect” and a negative “risk effect,” causing managers to trade off these countervailing effects when managing earnings. We posit that greater opportunities to manage earnings alter the risk-reward tradeoff related to portfolio delta, potentially changing the association between stock price incentives and earnings management. We do not find a significant association between stock price incentives and earnings management using tax expense on average. However, the association is positive and significant when tax-related earnings management opportunities are sufficiently high, consistent with opportunities mitigating the risk effect of delta.

We find a positive association between audit fee pressure and changes in NAS at the audit office level. We also find increased rates of client misstatement among audit offices that increase focus on NAS in the presence of audit fee pressure compared to audit offices that do not, suggesting a joint effect on audit quality. We find that the reduction in audit quality occurs in large audit offices.

We argue that heightened intergroup anxiety related to male–female interactions leads incumbents to seize on social attributes that bolster category‐based trust in the reliability of prospective directors' interpersonal behavior. We predict that in response to #MeToo coverage, incumbents evaluate board candidates more positively when they share demographic characteristics or have prior social connections, and these effects are strengthened when incumbents socially identify with the firm. Empirical analyses using a longitudinal survey of evaluations of director candidates support these predictions. Our findings suggest how social movements can produce unintended consequences by inadvertently triggering psychological processes that partially offset the anticipated benefits of the movement. Managerial Summary Increased coverage of #MeToo has heightened concerns among board members about male–female interactions on the board. Our study finds that as #MeToo coverage increases, incumbent directors evaluate potential board candidates more positively to the extent that they share demographic characteristics, including gender, race, functional background, education and age, or when they are connected through the social network of board appointments. These effects are especially pronounced for incumbents who psychologically identify with the firm, meaning that their self‐concept is aligned with features of the organization. Our study suggests how psychological reactions of corporate directors to #MeToo may inadvertently reduce board diversity and overall board effectiveness, and we call for research‐based interventions to correct this unfortunate side effect of a critically important social justice movement.",Crossref,95.84487534626038,10.1002/smj.3405,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3405,Strategic Management Journal,"Bednar, M., Westphal, J., & McDonald, M.

We develop theory to explain how and why leaders should enter into evaluations of the firms that they lead. Specifically, we propose that CEOs’ effects on corporate reputation will depend on leader prominence and on perceptions of leader quality. We thus test hypotheses that examine how CEOs’ media coverage, industry awards, and outsider standing affect the reputations of their firms.

These penalties should deter questionable behavior and enable reputation to serve a social control function, yet we know little about how and when these penalties are actually imposed. Unlike prior research in this vein, we account for the fact that reputational penalties associated with such practices may differ across audiences because of differences in interpretations of the practice and differences in causal attributions about its use. Specifically, we develop theory to explain how and when stock analysts and peer executives applied reputational penalties to managers when firms used a poison pill, a prominent anti-takeover device. We find that the reputational penalties associated with poison pills differed substantially between these two groups and that these groups applied different penalties depending on the media coverage that the poison pill received, the performance of the firm, and the extent to which the practice had already been adopted.

Other leadership research has also assumed that leaders, especially founders, can transform their leadership influence into a legacy that will survive death and departure from the organization and continue to impact followers. However, to understand the historically embedded nature of leadership influence, it is critical to unpack how specific leaders can become group prototypes and influence followers after their departure. We address this opportunity by examining organizational ghosts—former organizational members who become the ideal prototype of an organization’s values and identity. Drawing on qualitative data from an organizational merger, our analysis reveals that admired and adored leaders with broad exposure became embodied organizational prototypes. After organizational exit, they became organizational ghosts, institutionalized by associative learning, perpetuated practices, and physical memory work. When activated—either intentionally or organically—these ghosts had “ghostly encounters” (remembered and imagined) with remaining members that safeguarded the organization, comforted organizational members, and devalued alternative value systems. We introduce the concept of organizational ghosts, explain how leaders can become ghosts, and specify remembered and imagined encounters as mechanisms through which former leaders can have enduring influence in organizations.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),84.36018957345972,,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2022.0622,"JS Bednar, JA Brown - Academy of Management Journal, 2024 - journals.aom.org","Bednar, J., & Brown, J.

However, these findings may overestimate the benefits of leader humility and overlook its potential costs. Integrating person–supervisor fit theory and balance theory with the humility literature, we employ a dyadic approach to consider supervisor and employee humility simultaneously. We investigate whether and how the (in)congruence of supervisor and employee humility influences employee citizenship and deviance behaviors. We conducted a multilevel, multiphase, and multisource field study to test our hypotheses. The results of cross-level polynomial regression analyses revealed that when supervisors and employees were incongruent in humility, employees experienced higher levels of negative affect toward supervisors. Also, compared to those in low–low congruent dyads, employee negative affect toward supervisors was lower in high–high congruent dyads. The results further revealed asymmetric incongruence effects: employees experienced the highest levels of negative affect toward supervisors when their own humility was lower than their supervisors'.

From 2000 and 2018, the average age at which TIAA participants stopped contributing to their accounts, which is a lower bound on their retirement age, rose by 1.2 years for female and 2.0 years for male participants. There is considerable variation in the elapsed time between the time of the last contribution to and the first income draw from plan accounts. Only 40% of participants take an initial income payment within 48 months of their last contribution. Later retirement and lags between retirement and the first retirement income payout led to a growing fraction of participants reaching the required minimum distribution (RMD) age before starting income draws. Between 2000 and 2018, the fraction of first-time income recipients who took no income until their RMD rose from 10% to 52%, while the fraction of these recipients who selected a life-contingent annuitized payout stream declined from 61% to 18%. Among those who began receiving income before age 70, annuitization rates were significantly higher than among those who did so at older ages. Aggregating across all income-receiving beneficiaries at TIAA, not just new income recipients, the proportion with a life annuity as part of their payout strategy fell from 52% in 2008 to 31% in 2018. By comparison, the proportion of all income recipients taking an RMD payment rose from 16% to 29%. About one-fifth of retirees received more than one type of income; the most common pairing was an RMD and a life annuity.

Although prior research has examined auditors’ responses to noncompliance risks in the context of foreign bribery and political corruption, these studies’ insights are limited due to a focus on regional corruption proxies or clients with observable acts of foreign corruption. Our study introduces a Google document-frequency measure that captures both the actual and perceived prevalence of illegal acts by firms in each year. A key advantage of our time-varying, client-specific measure is that it provides a holistic proxy of illegality by capitalizing on widely disseminated textual information in decentralized Internet databases. We first demonstrate that our Google-based corruption measure is a leading predictor of client noncompliance risks, offering incremental predictive power beyond regional corruption proxies. We then predict and find that auditors’ input and output behavior is associated with this novel measure. Specifically, in response to client corruption, auditors adjust their production inputs and charge higher audit fees. Related to audit output, we find that financial restatements and auditor decision errors are more prevalent for corrupt clients. This evidence suggests that, although auditors appropriately price for noncompliance risk, their execution of the audit does not fully adjust for the risk identified.",Semantic Scholar,97.1428571428571,10.3390/foods11152235,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d4de2db3bbe2d0e596fb9beee22851b80b69dd0,Foods,"Brown, N., Joe, J., Williams Smith, K., & Wang, H.

We use two experiments to provide evidence on the effects of disclosure repetition (repeating of information in the filing) and disclosure interactivity (user involvement in directing the form or content of the information displayed) on investors’ information processing and investment judgments. Results show that repetition increases investors’ processing of repeated information, consistent with the informational role of repetition documented in prior research. In contrast, repetition reduces investors’ processing of other, nonrepeated information when the filing is less interactive. This evidence corroborates concerns that repetition can obscure value‐relevant information from investors. However, we find that more interactive disclosures mitigate this harmful effect of repetition on investors’ processing of nonrepeated information. Further, more interactive disclosures lead to deeper overall processing of both repeated and nonrepeated information, rather than more interactive disclosures redirecting investors’ attention and processing away from repeated information. Thus, our evidence suggests that disclosure interactivity is an important disclosure attribute that counteracts the potentially harmful effects of repetition on investors' processing of nonrepeated information, while preserving repetition's informational role.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),92.41379310344827,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-679X.12420,"NC Brown, BT Gale, SM Grant - Journal of Accounting …, 2022 - Wiley Online Library","Brown, N., Gale, B., & Grant, S.

However, the presentation of non-GAAP metrics in prospectus and other disclosure filings can lead to several problems such as lack of comparability with industry peers, misinterpretation by investors, and heightened scrutiny by regulators and the business media.

By restricting mobile communication across a potentially sizable set of local individuals, these restrictions could inhibit local information flow and, in turn, the market activity of stocks headquartered in enforcement states. We first document a decline in Google search activity for local stocks when restrictions take effect, suggesting that constraints on mobile communication significantly affect individuals’ information search activity. We further find significant declines in local trading volume when restrictions are enforced. This drop in liquidity is (1) attenuated when laws provide substitutive means of mobile communication and (2) magnified when locals have long car commutes and when their daily commutes overlap with regular exchange hours. Moreover, trading volume suffers the most for local stocks with lower institutional ownership, less analyst coverage, and more intangible information. Additional analyses show lower intraday volume during local commute times when mobile connectivity is constrained. Together, our results suggest that local information and local investors matter in stock markets and that mobile communication is an important mechanism through which these elements operate to affect liquidity and price discovery.",Crossref,91.86046511627907,10.1111/1475-679x.12077,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12077,Journal of Accounting Research,"Brown, N., Stice, H., & White, R.

It appears that morphological k-corrections are only significant in a minority of cases, and that once these are accounted for, evolution is still demanded - galaxies were smaller and more irregular in the past, with some of the peculiarities probably merger-related. This multi-waveband data set also enables a study of the spatially-resolved stellar populations in distant galaxies.

We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets.

First, it is demonstrated that simply and directly using the definition of the distribution function of a sum of random variables can calculate the Poisson binomial distribution function efficiently.

We argue that governments use their influence over the SOEs to build or strengthen a political coalition that supports the governments’ agenda.

The chapter shows how since the 1960s, the role of firms in the economic development of Latin America was addressed from different perspectives ranging from Dependency Theory, structuralism, and neo-institutionalism. The dominance of each of these perspectives, we maintain, was consistent with wider debates on which policy was most suited to achieving economic development. Even though before the 1990s, few scholars conducting this research referred to themselves as business historians, their research provides a wealth of information relevant to business history. By the mid-2000s, business history had established itself as an independent field in Latin American scholarship that dialogued with the global business history community.

By using the concept of ‘public good’ as our analytical lens, we show that when the organisation creates a narrative that coincides with that of the nation-state, this poses enormous challenges to the organisation’s efforts to control how and by whom this narrative is used. This is because anyone belonging to the nation-state can legitimately make use of that narrative. Therefore, the boundary conditions that permit other actors to use these historical narratives are delimited by those able to define who belongs to the nation-state and who does not.

To this end, we adopt a history-to-theory approach and examine the role the US multinational Standard Oil of New Jersey played in settling a diplomatic impasse between the United States and Colombia in the 1910s and 1920s.

We develop a history‐to‐theory study based on the evolution of the banana GVC between 1899 and 1991. We argue that when a MNC's bargaining power vis‐à‐vis the host government is strong, it will choose a governance structure that addresses contractual uncertainty. When the MNC's bargaining power declines because of changes in the institutional environment, it will prioritize a governance structure that protects its assets. We analyze the evolution of MNC's bargaining power as a result of the interaction of three levels of the institutional environment: global, home country, and host country. Managerial Summary Our study examines vertical integration decisions in a global value chain (GVC) throughout its historical evolution. Using historical sources, we show that when MNC managers perceive their bargaining power to be sufficient to protect them from hostile government actions in host countries, their main concern is that of governing their activities as efficiently as possible by amongst others vertically integrating asset‐specific transactions. When their bargaining power declines, MNCs become more concerned with shielding their assets and rents from expropriations by host‐country governments, thus retreating from vertical integration. We illustrate that the bargaining power of MNCs changes as events at the global, home, and host country levels unfold. For example, MNCs' bargaining power declines in periods featuring economic nationalism, such as the 1960s–1970s.",Crossref,100.0,10.1002/smj.3537,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3537,Strategic Management Journal,"Bucheli, M., Ciravegna, L., & Sáenz, L.

Those explanations miss important considerations related to the host-country technological and political environment. In response, we develop and analyze a game theoretical model suggesting that expropriation of multinational firm operations is more likely when: (1) the host-country government capability to monitor taxation of multinational firms is lower; (2) the host-country government capability to run said operations is higher; (3) the host-country government is relatively independent from the exports of the multinational firm-led exports, and (4) political competition is highly restricted. Perhaps paradoxically, we also find that multinational firms are more likely to “self-tax” when host-country governments are too lenient.

First, why did business groups in emerging markets thrive and prevail after pro‐market reforms were implemented in their countries? And, second, what type of adaptation strategies can multinational corporations develop in order to be competitive in economies dominated by business groups? By conducting an archive‐based historical network analysis of business groups in Chile during periods of major economic and political transitions, we maintain that business groups were created in periods of protectionism as a way to navigate economies with strong state participation or inefficient markets. In this process, these groups endogenously created an economy with market imperfections resulting from the dominance of these business groups. This means that the transition toward more open markets did not necessarily create more competitive environments and that elites in emerging economies were unwilling to abandon the advantages of having links between their businesses. Multinationals entering this economy adapted by becoming business groups themselves and creating links with other business groups. In sum, strategies devised as means to reduce market imperfections created new imperfections that incentivized the business groups to retain their structure and forced multinationals to become business groups. Managerial Summary: Large diversified conglomerates known as business groups dominate the markets of emerging economies. These groups have survived important changes taking place in their own countries, including the abandonment of an import substitution industrialization model for an open market one or changes from military regimes to democratic ones. This article explores two aspects related to these transitions most emerging economies have gone through. First, why did some business groups survive despite the fact that many of them were created and grew during protectionist times? And, second, what strategies have multinational corporations developed when operating in economies dominated by those powerful business groups?

We argue that the success or failure of these strategies depends on (a) the perceived legitimacy of these connections among a host country’s society during times of change and (b) the capability of the multinational’s political connections to shield it from challenges arising when the host country’s social structure is undergoing deep transformations. We outline and follow a business historical approach that combines the theoretical frameworks of international business, strategy, organizational theory, and political science to analyze multinationals operating in Chile’s energy and telecommunications sectors from 1932 to 1973. Managerial Summary: Western multinationals face hard challenges when trying to legitimize their operations vis‐à‐vis the host country’s societies in emerging and underdeveloped countries. One strategy developed by multinationals to neutralize potential challenges to their legitimacy has been to establish connections with influential members of the host country’s elites. We study how this strategy fares in host countries that are undergoing dramatic political and economic changes. We first argue that overtly maintaining open connections with an elite that is viewed as a relic of an illegitimate past can become a liability.

We found that if we use the entire PDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are less biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins.

In this paper, we present a novel meta-classification framework that combines and fully exploits different techniques to produce a more robust star-galaxy classification. To demonstrate this hybrid, ensemble approach, we combine a purely morphological classifier, a supervised machine learning method based on random forest, an unsupervised machine learning method based on self-organizing maps, and a hierarchical Bayesian template fitting method. Using data from the CFHTLenS survey, we consider different scenarios: when a high-quality training set is available with spectroscopic labels from DEEP2, SDSS, VIPERS, and VVDS, and when the demographics of sources in a low-quality training set do not match the demographics of objects in the test data set. We demonstrate that our Bayesian combination technique improves the overall performance over any individual classification method in these scenarios.

Drawing on research suggesting that discrimination increases during recessions, we test whether the racial wage gap expands during economic downturns. Using longitudinal wage data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics over a 40-year time period (N = 18,954), we find that the wage gap between Black and White workers increases with the unemployment rate. Moreover, we find that the cyclical wage gap is more pronounced in states in which Whites hold more negative attitudes about Blacks and in states with larger Black populations, suggesting that the racial wage gap expansion during recessions is at least partially driven by discrimination. Finally, we find evidence for at least two mechanisms by which the wage gap expands during recessions. First, we find that Black workers are more likely to lose their jobs during downturns and earn lower wages upon reemployment than comparable Whites. Second, we find that Black hourly workers are slightly more likely to have their hours reduced during recessions than White hourly workers, thereby resulting in lower earnings.

Typically an organization’s decision to deploy a manager to one of several possible contexts is endogenous to unobservable factors, and selection makes it challenging to disentangle the effect of workplace context on individual career advancement. We work around this problem by studying an organization, the Indian Administrative Services, which deploys entry-level managers quasirandomly across India. We find that managers deployed to more challenging contexts early in their careers experience faster career advancement in the short term. We present suggestive evidence that this is because challenging contexts provide managers more opportunities to develop skills (“crucible experiences”), and a greater motivation to relocate out of the challenging context. We also find that managers deployed to a challenging context early in their careers continue to experience faster advancement in the long term, suggesting that initial deployment to a challenging context is associated with human capital development.

This research question is important, given the widespread use of non-GAAP metrics in M&A valuation and lack of evidence regarding the real effects of non-GAAP disclosure. Public non-GAAP disclosure can enhance bidders' ability to assess a target's core earnings and potential synergy, especially in the earlier stages of due diligence, and enable bidders to make better M&A decisions. We find that target firms' non-GAAP disclosures are associated with greater M&A efficiency, greater synergies, and lower likelihood of post-acquisition goodwill impairment. We also find some evidence that target firms' non-GAAP disclosures are positively related to post-acquisition operating performance. Further, we find modest evidence that the positive relation between non-GAAP disclosures and M&A efficiency is stronger (1) for targets that are more difficult to value, (2) for targets with weaker information environments, and (3) when targets' non-GAAP numbers are of higher quality.

The Informativeness of Job Vacancy Duration for Future Firm Profitability,"Chen, Ciao-Wei",2023,"Abstract Job vacancy duration reflects the time a firm spends searching, selecting, and hiring for a job opening. Capturing vacancy duration using the creation and deletion dates of job postings by US public firms, we examine the informativeness of vacancy duration for future firm profitability. We find that while firms that quickly fill low-skill job vacancies exhibit higher future profitability, firms that take more time to fill high-skill jobs exhibit higher future profitability. Our cross-sectional analyses across the benefits and costs of candidate selection and performance expectations suggest that the informativeness of vacancy duration comes from its reflection of firms’ hiring strategies. That is, firms expecting higher profitability recruit more intensively to avoid the opportunity cost associated with vacancies for low-skill jobs and to ensure the selection of high-quality workers for high-skill jobs. Further analyses show that the implication of job vacancy duration for future profitability is not incorporated timely in the capital markets, as evidenced by pessimistic analyst forecasts and positive earnings announcement returns in future quarters for firms with short (long) durations for low-skill (high-skill) jobs. These results demonstrate the informativeness of job vacancy duration for firm profitability and advance the understanding of firms’ hiring strategies.",Crossref,89.10891089108911,10.1007/s11142-023-09797-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-023-09797-2,Review of Accounting Studies,"Chen, C., & Li, L.

We show that the introduction of these rules leads to a decrease in investment, which is more pronounced for firms with high reliance on leases. We posit and find that lease capitalization affects investment via a learning channel and a contracting channel. Regarding the first channel, we argue that managers identify areas of overinvestment and activities that should be discontinued or downsized because of the information they collect and analyze to comply with lease-capitalization rules. Accordingly, we find that the effect of lease capitalization is stronger when learning opportunities are higher. Regarding the second channel, we argue that lease capitalization affects investment via its effect on contracts. Accordingly, we document an increase in the likelihood of covenant breaches and a stronger decline in investment for financially constrained firms.

Using hand‐collected data, I find that the disclosure of private targets’ financial statements is associated with better acquisition decisions. Furthermore, I find that this disciplining effect of disclosure is more pronounced when monitoring by outside capital providers is more difficult and costly, and when other disciplining mechanisms are weaker.

We examine the effects of failure disclosure on employees’ exploration performance using an experiment in which participants perform a letter-search task by counting the search letters in each question (i.e., exploitation) or identifying an embedded shortcut that applies to all questions (i.e., exploration). We manipulate two factors: (1) whether participants are encouraged to disclose their failed attempts at finding the shortcut to future participants and (2) whether they are evaluated for their task-related skills. We predict and find failure disclosure increases the likelihood of shortcut identification in the presence of evaluation, and this effect is mitigated in the absence of evaluation.

Such contracts may be perceived as unfair, potentially reducing employee motivation and performance. We predict that adding a second‐chance provision, an opportunity to reverse a penalty for poor performance if subsequent performance improves, could improve the effectiveness of penalty contracts. In a quasi field experiment at a company with two manufacturing facilities in Taiwan, we treated one facility with a traditional‐penalty contract without a second‐chance provision and the other with a penalty contract with a second‐chance provision. We observe a significant difference in the two treatment effects, with employee performance decreasing significantly after the traditional‐penalty treatment but showing no decrease when a second‐chance provision was included. Further analysis reveals that this difference is mediated by employees' fairness perceptions.

Using a staggered difference-in-differences research design, we document that BGD interventions improve investment outcomes. We find that treated firms reduce inefficient investment by 0.6 percent of total assets or 6.5 percent of total investment and are 4 percentage points more likely to have above-median investment efficiency. Cross-sectional tests reveal more pronounced results when BGD interventions are mandatory, are strongly enforced, and result in larger BGD increases. Event-time, stacked panel, and a wide variety of endogeneity-mitigating robustness tests corroborate. Our plausibly causal inferences have important implications for both research and practice.

We predict that the bullwhip ratio (a proxy for the bullwhip effect) amplifies the relation between demand uncertainty and cost structure. We expect this amplifying effect because the bullwhip ratio determines the extent to which demand uncertainty translates into uncertainty in production or purchases, which, in turn, affects cost structure. Using data from public US firms over the 1990–2020 period, we find results consistent with our prediction. Specifically, we find that both the negative relation between demand uncertainty and cost elasticity in the manufacturing sector and the positive relation between the two in the retail/wholesale sectors are stronger for firms with higher bullwhip ratios.

Supply risk has increased in the last three decades due to an increasing prevalence of concentrated supplier bases. We predict that firms with high supplier-base concentration will choose a more elastic cost structure in response to the increased supply risk. Using a unique dataset of 4,530 firm-year observations hand-collected from supplier information disclosed by Chinese-listed firms, we document a positive association between supplier-base concentration and cost elasticity. Furthermore, results from five cross-sectional tests are consistent with supply risk driving the association between supplier-base concentration and cost elasticity. Our study provides important practical implications to managers. To the extent that supplier-base concentration poses a supply risk, our study suggests that managers can respond by making the cost structure more flexible.

In this environment, some organizations make employees' self-set performance goals public while other organizations do not. We predict that, due to strategic concerns induced by goal publicity and competition, making goals public will be more likely to lead employees to lowball their goals when they work under tournament incentives than under piece-rate incentives. Consistent with this prediction, our experimental results reveal that making self-set performance goals public decreases goal level under tournament incentives but has no significant effect on goal level under piece-rate incentives. Results of our study suggest that the practice of making self-set goals public is potentially more compatible with organizations with a collaborative culture than those with a competitive culture.

Theoretically, while tailoring potentially enhances the informativeness of performance measures for top management and middle managers respectively, it may reduce the incentives for the two parties to coordinate with each other. We expect a firm's decision to tailor performance measurement between top management and middle managers to be driven by this cost-benefit trade-off. Using hand-collected data from performance-based equity incentive plans from Chinese public firms, we find evidence consistent with the predictions derived from our theoretical framework. Specifically, we find that the likelihood that a firm tailors the weights on objective versus subjective performance measures between top and middle managers increases with competition intensity, non-price competition, environmental uncertainty, and CEO power, and decreases with organizational stability and growth opportunity. Furthermore, we find that suboptimal tailoring decisions are associated with higher management turnover.",Crossref,100.0,10.2308/jmar-18-042,https://doi.org/10.2308/jmar-18-042,Journal of Management Accounting Research,"Chen, C., Gao, Y., Wang, Y., & Xue, S.

We investigate two under-appreciated benefits of below-market pay in these social-mission organizations. In a series of experiments, we predict and find that, holding employees' outside opportunities constant, those attracted to social-mission organizations that pay below-market wages perform better individually and cooperate more effectively in teams than those attracted to social-mission organizations that pay higher wages. The individual performance effect arises because below-market pay facilitates the selection of value-congruent employees who are naturally inclined to work hard for the organizational mission. The team cooperation effect arises because employees expect team members who have selected a social-mission job that pays below market to be more value-congruent and, therefore, more cooperative than those who have selected a social-mission job that pays higher wages.

Employees, however, do not always receive information about pay-level differences at higher ranks prior to joining the company. While some companies openly disclose prize spread information across these ranks, others keep such information secret. In this paper, we experimentally investigate whether the availability of tournament prize spread information enhances employee effort through both a selection effect and a motivation effect. We predict and find that when employees can select into tournaments of varying prize spreads (which proxies for an environment where prize spread information is available), high-ability employees are more likely than low-ability employees to select into the tournament with a larger prize spread. Thus, the availability of prize spread information produces a separation of employees based on ability. We also find that employees exert more effort when they can select into a tournament than when they are randomly assigned to one (which proxies for an environment where prize spread information is absent). We show that this result is driven by greater homogeneity in the ability of tournament contestants when the availability of tournament prize spread information provides self-selection opportunity.

While firms can provide incentives to encourage internal whistleblowing, it remains controversial how such incentives should be structured. We examine whether the effectiveness of incentives encouraging internal whistleblowing is a joint function of the framing of such incentives (reward or penalty) and the strength of descriptive norms supporting internal whistleblowing. We predict and find in a lab experiment that penalties lead to a greater increase in internal whistleblowing (compared to rewards) when descriptive norms supporting whistleblowing are stronger. Our study contributes to the previous accounting literature on dishonesty and the role of management control systems design in promoting honesty and ethical norms in organizations. We also contribute to an emerging accounting literature on the links between controls, norms, and individual behavior by distinguishing between descriptive norms and injunctive norms and by highlighting the interplay between these two types of norms.

The strategy literature describes business strategies using the concepts of formulation, implementation, and fit. The management accounting literature links these strategy concepts with the selection and use of performance measures. Building on these two streams we examine whether and how a multidimensional performance measurement system can be used to distinguish between strategic problems related to strategic inputs, customer-oriented strategic outputs, and financial performance. We use data from the performance measurement system of a field site that formulated, implemented, and subsequently abandoned an innovative operating strategy. Managers learned the strategy was ineffective over a two-year period. We find that the company's internal performance measures systematically reveal more timely information about problems with the strategy. Furthermore, the performance measures can help identify where and why the strategy failed. The results are consistent with strategy inputs leading to positive customer experiences but poor financial performance because of a poor fit between the strategy and the firm's internal capabilities and skills.

We find that nominal teams generate a significantly larger number of unique fraud risk factors and fraud hypotheses than interacting teams. Nominal teams also generate higher-quality fraud hypotheses. We provide evidence that social loafing by less experienced auditors in interacting teams drives the differences between nominal and interacting teams in the fraud hypothesis generation task. In addition, less experienced auditors have less developed mental simulations for frauds in interacting teams compared to those in nominal teams.

We accordingly apply and advance the literature on reverse-knowledge transfers and capability upgrading by first considering the relevance of cross-border acquisition activities on domestic productivity in an emerging-market context, and by second extending the literature’s understanding of the target-firm characteristics which abet domestic-productivity upgrading. Employing firm-level panel data based on 329 Chinese multinationals over the 2000–2010 period, we find outward cross-border acquisition activities generate increased domestic productivity.

Answering these broader questions allows factoring how firms might respond to new‐normal conditions; and yields normative implications regarding the transformational strategies – and policies – that enhance productivity growth and reverse new‐normal stagnation. Using cross‐industry panel data, we identify the transformational strategies that are both commonly employed and commonly successful.

Contemporary scholarship, however, often associates foreign direct investment (FDI) with efficiency‐enhancing properties and thus neglects the market‐power interpretation of the MNE. Such an imbalance is problematic given that the theoretical and empirical justifications behind the field's embrace of the efficiency interpretation are not fully evident. Instead, both efficiency and market‐power effects are seemingly present in cross‐border investment activity. Based on a comprehensive sample of up to 4,361 cross‐border investments materializing between 1986 and 2010, we present theoretically‐grounded hypotheses with regard to when market‐power effects will tend to dominate efficiency effects.

Action research integrates theory with action to solve problems, improve practices, and address issues together with those who experience them. Yet the body of action research in accounting education remains very small. Historically, efforts to reform accounting education have led to pockets of innovation but have not systematically addressed impediments that inhibit widespread continuous improvement. Lack of available formal training inhibits development of the action research capacity needed to support broad reform in accounting education. This paper provides a conceptual action research framework that includes two ontologies to classify different types of action research. One type, emancipated action research, involves taking strategic action to change or eliminate structural impediments that limit improvement achievable through other types, often earlier phases, of action research. The paper reports an action research project that involved two strategic actions, investigation of an action research reflection practice and use of an educative case to report the project. The case illustrates how action research can support reform in accounting education and demonstrates a generalizable approach accounting educators and education researchers can use to develop action research capacity.",Crossref,93.7062937062937,10.2308/iace-51586,https://doi.org/10.2308/iace-51586,Issues in Accounting Education,"Curtis, S.

By fall of 2018, the program will enroll more than 1,700 students from 70 countries. With its US$22,000 tuition, about 1/3 the price of programs of similar caliber, the iMBA is reaching under-served populations, including those unable to pay premium prices or make time for in-person residency as well as late-career learners who are disinclined to attend a conventional program. One of the iMBA’s major breakthroughs is its scalability, and that scalability has been accomplished in ways that enhance the quality of education. An iMBA course has two main components – an open MOOC, which delivers core concepts equivalent to what might be covered in a conventional in-person lecture, plus a live global classroom led by a professor and supported by a team of course assistants. As the MOOC delivers the fundamentals of a topic, the live-engagement class focuses on a richer exploration of the material. In the live-engagement classes, hundreds of students can participate simultaneously—yet receive significant individual attention and personalization by interacting with professors and course assistants in real time through chat technology. Students also interact with each other, which often results in side topics being explored, thus producing a richer environment for knowledge discovery than would be possible in a traditional lecture hall in which side conversations are discouraged. Course assistants answer basic questions, and elevate particularly important insights or questions to the professor at the head of the full class, also in real time. Another distinctive feature of the iMBA is that it is delivered in “stackable” components: A MOOC plus live-engagement element stacks into a for-credit course. A series of for-credit courses stack plus a capstone project stacks into a “Specialization.” In turn, a series of Specializations stack into the full MBA degree. In this way, students have various on-ramps to the full degree. The iMBA has to a significant degree cured the cost disease in higher education. Faculty create content for multiple uses – for the full MBA as well as for certificate programs, for example—producing multiple revenue streams.

Crop insurance is a risk management tool developed to mitigate some of this weather risk and protect farmer income in times of poor production. However, crop insurance may have unintended consequences for water resources sustainability, as the vast majority of freshwater withdrawals go to agriculture. The causal impact of crop insurance on water use in agriculture remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the empirical relationship between crop insurance and irrigation water withdrawals in the United States. Importantly, we use an instrumental variables approach to establish causality. Our methodology exploits a major policy change in the crop insurance system – the 1994 Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act – which imposed crop insurance requirements on farmers. We find that a 1% increase in insured crop acreage leads to a 0.223% increase in irrigation withdrawals, with most coming from groundwater aquifers. We identify farmers growing more groundwater-fed cotton as an important mechanism contributing to increased withdrawals. A 1% increase in insured crop acreage leads to a 0.624% increase in cotton acreage, or 95,602 acres. These results demonstrate that crop insurance causally leads to more irrigation withdrawals.

The present value of this increase significantly exceeds that of direct disaster aid.

First, we show that the public significantly underestimated the extent of the scientific consensus. We then find that those given concrete information about scientists’ views were more likely to report believing that climate change was already underway and that it was caused by humans. However, their beliefs about the necessity of making policy decisions and their willingness to donate money to combat climate change were not affected. Information provision affected liberals, moderates, and conservatives similarly, implying that the gap in beliefs between liberals and conservatives is not likely to be bridged by information treatments similar to the one we study.

As residual claimants of corporate tax planning, shareholders benefit from lower corporate taxes, but also bear the financial and reputational costs of subsequent tax enforcement. Despite the influential advisory role of external tax advisors in corporate tax planning, existing research on how shareholders perceive this role is limited. Using event study methods and exploiting the heightened regulation of tax advice through the covered opinion rules as a setting, we observe average and cross-sectional stock returns consistent with shareholders perceiving external tax advisors as contributing unfavorably to tax planning by promoting excessively risky strategies.

This negative externality is stronger when the relatively higher taxed competitors (1) are financially constrained, (2) operate in more competitive markets, (3) have similar products to their lower taxed rivals, (4) face rivals that retain more of their cash tax savings due to lower dividends and share repurchases, and (5) face lower taxed, but financially constrained, rivals.

These increasingly common organizational structures facilitate corporate tax savings by enabling sponsor firms to increase tax‐advantaged activities and/or enhance their tax efficiency (i.e., relative tax savings of a given activity). Using path analysis, we find that SPEs facilitate greater tax avoidance such that an economically large amount of cash tax savings from research and development (R&D), depreciable assets, net operating loss carryforwards, intangible assets, foreign operations, and tax havens occur in conjunction with SPE use. We estimate that SPEs help generate over $330 billion of incremental cash tax savings, or roughly 6 percent of total U.S. federal corporate income tax collections during the sample period. Interaction analyses reveal that SPEs enhance the tax efficiency of intangibles and R&D by 61.5 percent to 87.5 percent.

Despite these differences, C and S corporations regularly compete for customers and capital. We examine whether and the extent to which competition from S corporations influences the future organizational form choice of rival C corporations and explore outcomes of this choice. Using data for 4,462 private U.S. commercial banks grouped by Metropolitan Statistical Area during 1997–2010, we find that greater competition from S corporation banks increases the likelihood that rival C corporation banks convert to Subchapter S status. We estimate that the aggregate first‐year tax savings from S conversion exceed $372 million. Consistent with these savings being used to maintain competitive parity with rivals, we find that converting banks increase their interest rates on customer deposits and advertising intensity.

There continues to be debate, however, concerning whether regulators should dictate board composition using input-based attributes of directors such as outside status. Opponents contend that board independence is best established through applying voluntary best practices to board processes. In this research, we study board processes and examine how the group task cohesion that is determined by directors' social similarity affects outside directors' reports that the CEO influences their beliefs, a key element of director independence. We propose that the degree of social similarity (similarity as to backgrounds) between outside directors and other directors is positively related to the degree of commitment directors have toward the board's tasks. We show that this task commitment (cohesion) has a positive effect on directors' efforts to obtain and receive information from the firm and CEO. Additional analyses show that the effect of information sharing on the level of CEO influence of outside directors depends on the presence of cognitive conflict—constructive discussion among directors regarding differing viewpoints—between the outside directors and the inside directors. We test our hypotheses using a survey, which was developed based on in-depth field interviews, and the archival data on directors' attributes as well as firm-level outcomes.

In our setting, the Chinese government substituted economic value added (EVA) for return on equity (ROE) in the performance score formula it uses to evaluate State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). In accordance with the Chinese government's objective to increase the capital efficiency of SOEs, supervisors shifted the weight in subjective adjustment decisions from ROE to EVA after EVA adoption. Consistent with EVA adoption creating fairness concerns, however, supervisors did not penalize SOEs for performing poorly on EVA when they performed well on ROE, and accomplished this by shifting the weight from EVA back to ROE. Additional analyses suggest that personal preferences motivated supervisors to make these lenient subjective adjustments.

Brooke",2022,"ABSTRACT We use experimental markets to examine how pushing investment information and the value relevance of that information interact to influence investors’ value estimate accuracy and market price efficiency. Developments in technology allow information to be pushed to investors anytime and anywhere. However, in addition to value‐relevant information, pushed information often includes information that is irrelevant for assessing firm value. Drawing on psychology theory, we find that pushing information has divergent effects depending on the value relevance of the information. Pushing only value‐relevant information increases investors’ processing of the information and leads to more accurate value estimates and market prices than when not pushed. In contrast, pushing a mix of value‐relevant and value‐irrelevant information reduces investors’ processing of value‐relevant information, leading to less accurate value estimates and market prices due to poorer acquisition and integration of information than when not pushed or when only value‐relevant information is pushed. Collectively, our results reveal a dark side to push technologies, particularly with the growing presence of value‐irrelevant information.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12400,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12400,Journal of Accounting Research,"Elliott, W., & Hobson, J.

We examine three key levels of trader‐management interaction to assess the accuracy of traders' market‐tested value estimates and resulting market price. These data require an engaging experiment and a complex, contextually rich asset, which we create by playing a popular gaming app before the experiment. Participants view financial information, ask management questions, estimate value, and trade. We find that receiving non‐personalized question responses improves trader estimates of value and market price efficiency relative to when traders ask questions but do not expect a response. This occurs because traders exert more effort estimating value and trading. However, receiving personalized versus non‐personalized responses harms value estimates and market efficiency.

Brooke",2017,"ABSTRACT Prior literature suggests that investors react less strongly to information in less readable disclosures. We extend this literature by considering how disclosure readability affects the sensitivity of investors' valuation judgments to the information contained in outside (i.e., non-firm) sources of information. Using an experiment, we present investors with a disclosure containing mixed news about the valence of firm performance, and this disclosure varies in readability. We find that investors who initially view a less readable firm disclosure provide valuation judgments that incorporate the outside information to a greater extent, such that their valuation judgments are more sensitive to whether outside information is relatively more or less supportive of management's positive forward-looking statements. We find evidence that this occurs primarily because investors who view a less readable initial disclosure feel less comfortable evaluating the firm and, in turn, rely more on the outside information. We also find that viewing a less readable firm disclosure indirectly increases the extent to which participants search outside information. Combined, our results suggest that investors' valuation judgments may be more influenced by outside sources of information when managers provide less readable firm disclosures, potentially limiting the extent to which managers can benefit from strategically issuing less readable disclosures to obfuscate poor performance. These findings also imply that investors might over-rely on more readable disclosures while discounting outside sources of information about the firm.

Brooke",2015,"ABSTRACT An enduring issue in financial reporting is whether and how salient summary measures of firm performance (“earnings metrics”) affect market price efficiency. In laboratory markets, we test the effects of salient earnings metrics, which vary in how they combine persistent and transitory elements, on investor information search, beliefs about value, offers to trade, and market price efficiency. We find that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes traders to search unnecessarily for further information about these elements and to overestimate their effect on fundamental value relative to a rational benchmark. In contrast, separately displaying persistent elements in earnings increases the accuracy of traders’ value estimates. Prices generally reflect traders’ beliefs about value, and prices are most efficient when transitory elements are excluded from earnings metrics entirely. Our study contributes to research on salience effects in financial reporting by showing that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes inefficient information search and biased beliefs about value that can aggregate to affect market prices. We also contribute to research in experimental markets by showing that redundant disclosure is not always beneficial; redundant disclosure of transitory earnings elements, in particular, appears to have negative consequences for investor behavior and market efficiency.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12080,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12080,Journal of Accounting Research,"Elliott, W., Hobson, J., & White, B.

In a preregistered survey of 25,422 participants across 90 societies, we map societal differences in 150 everyday norms and show that they can be explained by how societies prioritize individualizing moral foundations such as care and liberty versus binding moral foundations such as purity. Specifically, societies with more individualistic morality tend to have more permissive norms in general (greater liberty) and especially for behaviors deemed vulgar (less purity), but they exhibit less permissive norms for behaviors perceived to have negative consequences in specific situations (greater care). By comparing our data with available data collected twenty years ago, we find a global pattern of change toward more permissive norms overall but less permissive norms for the most vulgar and inconsiderate behaviors. This study explains how social norms vary across behaviors, situations, societies, and time.

Surprisingly, there is only moderate correspondence between these measures, but it is unclear why and what the implications are for identifying individual differences in social value orientation. Using a dataset of 8021 participants from 31 countries and regions, this study revealed that the Slider Measure identified fewer competitors than the Triple Dominance Measure, accounting for approximately one-third of the non-correspondence between the two measures. This is (partially) because many of the Slider items do not afford a competitive option. In items where competition is combined with individualism, competitors tended to make the same choices as individualists. Futhermore, we demonstrated the uniqueness of competitors.

Multilevel models suggested that attachment, but not glorification, was associated with increased trust in science and compliance with federal COVID‐19 guidelines.

We find that the policy leads to a sizable increase in wage inequality.

Other studies measure the likely distribution of burdens from global carbon agreements, especially comparing low-and high-income nations. In contrast, very few studies measure “horizontal” effects within each income group. Domestic climate policy will likely impose greater burdens on families with greater need for heat and air conditioning, compared to other families at the same income level in locations with less temperature variation. For example, Cronin, Fullerton and Sexton (2019) look at costs of a carbon tax reform in the US that has a fairly proportional vertical effect—ie, reducing real incomes by about 1 percent in all income deciles. Revenue rebates can reduce net burdens proportionally to near zero in all deciles, but revenue-neutral “carbon fee and dividend” also imposes wide disparities within each income group. Within the lowest-income decile, it reduces real net incomes of some households by 2 percent and raises real net incomes of others by 2 percent.

However, the use of few identity cues may cause customers to feel limited social presence and even suspect the human identity of agents, especially in the current age of advanced algorithms. Does such a lack of social presence affect service interactions? We studied this timely question by evaluating the impact of customers’ perceived social presence on service outcomes and customers’ attitudes toward agents. Our identification strategy hinged on Southwest Airlines’ sudden requirement to include a first name in response to service requests on Twitter, which enhanced customers’ perceived level of social presence. This change led customers to become more willing to engage and more likely to reach a resolution upon engagement. We further conducted a randomized experiment to understand the underlying mechanisms. We found that the effects were mainly driven by customers who were ex ante uncertain or suspicious about the human identity of agents, and the presence of identity cues improved service outcomes by enhancing customers’ perceived levels of trust and empathy. Additionally, we found no evidence of elevated verbal aggression from customers toward agents with identity cues, although a mechanism test revealed the moderating role of customers’ emotional states.

Using Federal Drug Administration drug enforcement reports and social media data crawled from online forums and Twitter, we investigate whether social media can accelerate the product recall process in the context of drug recalls. Results based on discrete-time survival analyses suggest that more adverse drug reaction discussions on social media lead to a higher hazard rate of the drug being recalled and, thus, a shorter time to recall. To better understand the underlying mechanism, we propose the information effect, which captures how extracting information from social media helps detect more signals and mine signals faster to accelerate product recalls, and the publicity effect, which captures how firms and government agencies are pressured by public concerns to initiate speedy recalls. Estimation results from two mechanism tests support the existence of these conceptualized channels underlying the acceleration hypothesis of social media.

The Roles of Service Quality and Awareness,"Gao, Yang",2021,"ABSTRACT Despite many advantages of social media as a customer service channel, there is a concern that active service intervention encourages excessive service complaints. Our paper casts doubt on this misconception by examining the dynamics between social media customer complaints and brand service interventions. We find service interventions indeed cause more complaints, yet this increase is driven by service awareness rather than chronic complaining. Due to the publicity and connectivity of social media, customers learn about the new service channel by observing customer service delivery to others—a mechanism that is unique to social media customer service and does not exist for traditional call centers. Importantly, high-quality service reduces future complaints. As a result, proactive customer service is a sound strategy on social media, as long as firms dedicate to service quality. Hence, firms should be less concerned about whether to respond and more focused on how to respond to customer complaints.",Semantic Scholar,100.0,10.1080/07421222.2021.1958548,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c20feeac0a22449ae912f98ea8b50f747a8a0acb,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Sun, S., Gao, Y., & Rui, H.

We analyze how the ratification of the prominent Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) impacted giving behavior on a leading education crowdfunding platform and find two contrasting donor tendencies. Although donors contributed more to local initiatives following the ratification, they contributed less to nonlocal initiatives, leading to a substantial net decline in the funds raised. These effects manifest through two mechanisms: information push and information pull. This hyper-localization exacerbates the resource-divide problem in education; schools with students of lower socioeconomic status experienced a sharper decline in the proportion of projects funded.

We analyze how stage stations lower the cost of last-mile delivery by leveraging the preexisting social fabric in rural communities, including local stores, as well as social technologies such as chat services and virtual groups. Specifically, we examine two models, a decentralized model with stage stations run by independent agents, and a centralized model, similar to the one pioneered by Alibaba Taobao. We find that when the delivery cost in rural areas is high, the decentralized model can lower the participation cost and increase both platform profit and social welfare. In general, the centralized model outperforms the decentralized one. One reason is that the decentralized model suffers from a double marginalization problem. The centralized model has more flexibility, for example, in determining the pricing policies for both sellers and buyers. It could offer free service to rural customers if the participation of fresh rural customers can attract many additional sellers. However, a centralized model may not be feasible in many countries. Therefore, we explore whether the platform can implement a coordination mechanism for decentralized stage stations. We find that our proposed coordination mechanism can improve the performance of the decentralized model.

Using a game-theoretic model, we show that a market in our setting can be divided into two distinct types based on the relative strength of buyers’ same-side negative externality and cross-side positive network effect. Our study provides several interesting insights. First, when buyers face relatively weak same-side negative externality, the platform can exert more effort to improve their experience, even when effort becomes costlier. Second, it may decrease its effort despite an increase in buyers’ same-side negative externality in both types of markets. In either case, the platform’s profit is not necessarily hurt.

To address this problem, we propose a system architecture to proactively identify products that are likely to go “out of favor.” Our approach uses historical data to extract useful information from customer ratings and textual reviews. Available data are fed into a state-of-the-art deep learning sequence model to forecast future ratings. We then analyze rating trends, extracting hyperparameters that a binary classifier uses to label products as “out-of-favor” or not. We tested this system on an Amazon dataset comprising nearly 800,000 observations across 2826 electronics products. Our results show that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model excels in forecasting future product ratings compared to other benchmarks. Ablation analysis shows sentiment-related features significantly improve rating forecasts by up to 40%, with review topics adding 10% and other review characteristics, 4%. Counterintuitively, topic extraction from reviews does not provide substantial benefits, despite the heavy computational resources it requires. Finally, the two-stage classification process, which leverages time-series data and rating trends, offers a more stable and robust performance than conventional single-stage methods. We provide considerations for system architecture development through robustness checks ensuring its resilience to stressors. Our experiments indicate that rating trends can change in subtle ways over time, leading a promising “star” product to turn into a liability (“dog”).

This heterogeneity is based on individual customer preferences in the choice of consideration sets, product information, pricing, and the search environment.

Optimizing Mobile Ad Contracts with Heterogeneous Advertisers,"Ghoshal, Abhijeet",2023,"Our research question is motivated by a real problem faced by an existing demand aggregator. The aggregator represents multiple advertisers, each of whom signs one of two types of contracts with the aggregator for bidding on an RTB (real‐time bidding) platform. A quality contract occurs on a cost‐per‐impression (CPM, i.e., cost per thousand impressions) basis. The advertiser is promised a minimum number of impressions and pays a CPM that is a function of the targeting quality as measured by the realized click‐through rate (CTR). In a performance contract the advertiser pays on a CPC (cost‐per‐click) basis constrained by a budget. We develop and solve a generalized profit maximization problem that jointly optimizes the aggregator's bidding and allocation decisions. The allocation policy optimally assigns each arriving bidding opportunity to a specific advertiser. The bidding policy then computes a bid amount for that allocation based on the estimated click probability of the opportunity. Our solution has nice theoretical properties. First, neither policy depends on the memory carried in the system, that is, the sequence of previous states and decisions, making the solution easy to implement. Second, the allocation policy is shown to have a threshold structure. This enables the assignment of arriving opportunities into one of two distinct sets, each corresponding to a specific advertising contract type. The assessment of the impact of the change in various parameters on the solution is used to derive several interesting and important implications for the management of advertising contracts.",Crossref,91.46341463414635,10.1111/poms.13890,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13890,Production and Operations Management,"Ghoshal, A., Mookerjee, R., & Sun, Z.

Rising readmission costs contribute significantly to increasing health care costs. Multiple areas of health care, including readmissions, have benefited from the application of various machine learning algorithms in several ways. Objective We aimed to identify suitable models for predicting readmission charges billed by hospitals. Our literature review revealed that this application of machine learning is underexplored. We used various predictive methods, ranging from glass-box models (such as regularization techniques) to black-box models (such as deep learning–based models). Methods We defined readmissions as readmission with the same major diagnostic category (RSDC) and all-cause readmission category (RADC). For these readmission categories, 576,701 and 1,091,580 individuals, respectively, were identified from the Nationwide Readmission Database of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for 2013. Linear regression, lasso regression, elastic net, ridge regression, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a deep learning model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) were the 6 machine learning algorithms we tested for RSDC and RADC through 10-fold cross-validation. Results Our preliminary analysis using a data-driven approach revealed that within RADC, the subsequent readmission charge billed per patient was higher than the previous charge for 541,090 individuals, and this number was 319,233 for RSDC. The top 3 major diagnostic categories (MDCs) for such instances were the same for RADC and RSDC. The average readmission charge billed was higher than the previous charge for 21 of the MDCs in the case of RSDC, whereas it was only for 13 of the MDCs in RADC. We recommend XGBoost and the deep learning model based on MLP for predicting readmission charges. The following performance metrics were obtained for XGBoost: (1) RADC (mean absolute percentage error [MAPE]=3.121%; root mean squared error [RMSE]=0.414; mean absolute error [MAE]=0.317; root relative squared error [RRSE]=0.410; relative absolute error [RAE]=0.399; normalized RMSE [NRMSE]=0.040; mean absolute deviation [MAD]=0.031) and (2) RSDC (MAPE=3.171%; RMSE=0.421; MAE=0.321; RRSE=0.407; RAE=0.393; NRMSE=0.041; MAD=0.031). The performance obtained for MLP-based deep neural networks are as follows: (1) RADC (MAPE=3.103%; RMSE=0.413; MAE=0.316; RRSE=0.410; RAE=0.397; NRMSE=0.040; MAD=0.031) and (2) RSDC (MAPE=3.202%; RMSE=0.427; MAE=0.326; RRSE=0.413; RAE=0.399; NRMSE=0.041; MAD=0.032).

We reopen this debate in the context of security circumvention by employees, currently a leading cause of information security and privacy breaches. Drawing on prior literature, we develop a microeconomic framework that captures employees’ circumventing behavior in the face of security controls. This allows us to obtain interesting insights that have implications for how an organization should employ anticircumvention measures. First, unless circumvention is rampant, education and enforcement often work better in combination, and not in isolation. Second, there are incentives for an organization to tolerate circumvention to an extent, even when education and enforcement are cheap. Finally, education and enforcement may be strategic complements or substitutes in different parts of the parameter space. When they are complements, if a change in cost parameters compels the organization to increase one, it would also require an increase in the other in lockstep.

Approaches that can help hide sensitive information could alleviate such concerns and increase the number of firms that are willing to share. Sensitive information in transactional databases often manifests itself in the form of association rules. The sensitive association rules can be concealed by altering transactions so that they remain hidden when the data are mined by the partner. The problem of hiding these rules in the data are computationally difficult (NP-hard), and extant approaches are all heuristic in nature. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that introduces the problem as a nonlinear integer formulation to hide the sensitive association rule while minimizing the alterations needed in the data set. We apply transformations that linearize the constraints and derive various results that help reduce the size of the problem to be solved. Our results show that although the nonlinear integer formulations are not practical, the linearizations and problem-reduction steps make a significant impact on solvability and solution time.

 Recommender systems enable firms to target customers with products and services that better match their needs, as well as cross-sell products and services. Considering these factors in markets with monopoly and duopoly, we investigate (i) How do pricing strategies differ when firms cross-sell versus when they do not cross-sell, and (ii) How do these pricing strategies change when a firm improves its recommender system? We find that cross-selling can enable a monopolist to subsidize its price for the focal products, while maximizing its profit. In a duopoly, the price set by the firm with the inferior system (low-type firm) is always lower when the firms cross-sell than when the firms do not cross-sell; however, that does not necessarily hold for the high-type firm. When the high-type firm improves its recommender system, the low-type firm may decrease its price when firms cross-sell, which does not happen when firms do not cross-sell.",Semantic Scholar ,100.0,10.1080/07421222.2021.1912930,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d205838fe341fd39e25ed6853246b9a77999c8ee,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Ghoshal, A., Mookerjee, V., & Sarkar, S.

The customer is strategic as she first visits the personalizing firm to find out what product to purchase among the recommended ones and purchases the product eventually from one of the firms. Overall, the customer distributes all her purchases across both the firms—she purchases from the personalizing firm to maintain a profile quality with the firm (to continue to obtain good recommendations) and from the non‐personalizing firm to benefit from the lower prices of that firm. We analyze this setup in a two‐stage game to find the subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium. In the first stage, firms decide to share data, or not. In the second stage they play a simultaneous move price game. We find that the non‐personalizing firm is always willing to share its data with the personalizing firm, but the personalizing firm uses it only when the learning rate influence dominates the profile influence. When the personalizing firm improves its system and both firms share data, its own profit always increases and under certain conditions the profit of the non‐personalizing firm also increases. Finally, social surplus may increase as well when firms share data.

However, there is evidence that the extent of sharing would be greater if information sensitive to retailers can be concealed before sharing. Extant research has only considered sensitive information at the organizational level. This is rarely the case in reality; the retail industry has adapted their offerings to region-wide differences in customer tastes for decades. Differences in customer characteristics across regions lead to region-specific sensitive information in addition to any at the organizational level. This is the first paper to propose an approach to solve this version of the problem. Region-level requirements increase the size of an already difficult (NP-hard) problem substantially, making adaptations of existing approaches impractical. We present an ensemble approach that draws intuition from Lagrangian relaxation to conceal sensitive patterns at the organizational and regional levels with minimal damage to the data set. Extensive computational experiments show that it identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions even when other approaches fail, doing so without any loss in recommendation effectiveness.

When releasing a new version of a product, in order to drive up its demand, the vendor must cease supporting the old version. However, the vendor’s ability to leverage the increased demand can be limited because of a commitment problem. For, when the demand increases and the vendor accordingly sets a higher price, many consumers might opt not to upgrade, creating a situation where stopping security-related support simply becomes too risky. To avoid this risk and any subsequent losses in reputation, the vendor can renege on its earlier decision to stop support. We show that this commitment problem hurts the vendor’s profitability and find that the no-commitment equilibrium profit can surprisingly increase with the cost to extend support. Accordingly, we propose a commitment mechanism. Further, the consumer surplus may actually increase if the vendor desists from crossing the proverbial line in the sand and discontinues support as planned.",Crossref,99.29078014184397,10.25300/misq/2017/41.4.10,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2017/41.4.10,MIS Quarterly,"Ghoshal, A., Lahiri, A., & Dey, D.

To explore this question, we model the strategic behavior of customers who make repeated purchases at two competing firms: one that provides personalized recommendations and another that does not. When a customer intends to purchase a product, she obtains recommendations from the personalizing firm and uses this recommendation to eventually purchase from one of the firms. The personalizing firm profiles the customer (based on past purchases) to recommend products. Hence, if a customer purchases less frequently from the personalizing firm, the recommendations made to her become less relevant. While considering the impact on the quality of recommendations received, a customer must balance two opposing forces: (1) the lower price charged by the non-personalizing firm, and (2) an additional fit cost incurred when purchasing from the non-personalizing firm and the increased cost due to recommendations of reduced quality in the future. An outcome of the analysis is that the customers should distribute their purchases across both firms to maximize surplus over a planning horizon. Anticipating this response, the firms simultaneously choose prices. We study the sensitivity of the equilibrium prices and profits of the firms with respect to the effectiveness of the recommender system and the profile deterioration rate. We also analyze some interesting variants of the base model in order to study how its key results could be influenced.

Recommender systems form a critical component of the business analytics toolkit and, by enabling firms to effectively target customers with products and services, are helping alter the e-commerce landscape. A variety of methods exist for providing recommendations, with collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and association-rule-based methods being the most common. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the quality of recommendations made using association rules. This is accomplished by combining rules when possible and stands apart from existing rule-combination methods in that it is strongly grounded in probability theory. Combining rules requires the identification of the best combination of rules from the many combinations that might exist, and we use a maximum-likelihood framework to compare alternative combinations. Because it is impractical to apply the maximum likelihood framework directly in real time, we show that this problem can equivalently be represented as a set partitioning problem by translating it into an information theoretic context—the best solution corresponds to the set of rules that leads to the highest sum of mutual information associated with the rules. Through a variety of experiments that evaluate the quality of recommendations made using the proposed approach, we show that (i) a greedy heuristic used to solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem is very effective, providing results comparable to those from using the optimal set partitioning solution; (ii) the recommendations made by our approach are more accurate than those made by a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks, including collaborative filtering and matrix factorization; and (iii) the recommendations can be made in a fraction of a second on a desktop computer, making it practical to use in real-world applications.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/isre.2015.0583,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2015.0583,Information Systems Research,"Ghoshal, A., Menon, S., & Sarkar, S.

We find that treated firms reduce inefficient investment by 0.6 percent of total assets or 6.5 percent of total investment and are 4 percentage points more likely to have above-median investment efficiency. Cross-sectional tests reveal more pronounced results when BGD interventions are mandatory, are strongly enforced, and result in larger BGD increases. Event-time, stacked panel, and a wide variety of endogeneity-mitigating robustness tests corroborate. Our plausibly causal inferences have important implications for both research and practice.

Moving beyond the early focus on conformity, we propose that the threat of status loss may make those with middle status more wary of advancing creative solutions in fear that they will be evaluated negatively. Using different manipulations of status and measures of creativity, we found that when being evaluated, middle-status individuals were less creative than either high-status or low-status individuals (Studies 1 and 2). In addition, we found that anxiety at the prospect of status loss also caused individuals with middle status to narrow their focus of attention and to think more convergently (Study 3). We delineate the consequences of power and status both theoretically and empirically by showing that, unlike status, the relationship between power and creativity is positive and linear (Study 4).

In this paper, we extend this nascent area of research on the consequences of creativity by showing that working on a creative task can contribute to feelings of liberation—feelings that can help people to overcome psychological burdens. We illustrate the liberating effects of creativity by integrating the embodied cognition literature with recent research showing that keeping a secret is experienced as a psychological and physical burden.While secrecy is metaphorically related to physical burden, creativity is metaphorically associated with freedom to “think outside the box” and explore beyond normal constraints. Thus, we predict permission to be creative may actually feel liberating and feelings of liberation may, in turn, lift the physical burden of keeping a big secret. The results of three studies supported our prediction and suggest that the opportunity to be creative may be a way for people to unburden without directly revealing secrets that could cause shame and embarrassment.

Using evidence from two group experiments, this paper tests theory on the effects of imposing a political correctness (PC) norm, one that sets clear expectations for how men and women should interact, on reducing interaction uncertainty and boosting creativity in mixed-sex groups. Our research shows that men and women both experience uncertainty when asked to generate ideas as members of a mixed-sex work group: men because they may fear offending the women in the group and women because they may fear having their ideas devalued or rejected. Most group creativity research begins with the assumption that creativity is unleashed by removing normative constraints, but our results show that the PC norm promotes rather than suppresses the free expression of ideas by reducing the uncertainty experienced by both sexes in mixed-sex work groups and signaling that the group is predictable enough to risk sharing more—and more-novel—ideas.

We first investigate whether a firm’s business strategy is associated with its level of tax avoidance (ie, how much tax is avoided). Next, we investigate the association between a firm’s business strategy and the extent to which the nature of its tax planning could be considered aggressive (ie, the level of outcome uncertainty associated with the reduction in tax). This research is important because it helps provide a better understanding of the factors that affect a firm’s propensity to engage in aggressive tax-avoidance behavior (Hanlon and Heitzman 2010). The distinguishing feature of our study is that it is grounded in a theoretical framework that is used to make clear predictions regarding the link between a firm’s business strategy and its tax aggressiveness.
Miles and Snow (1978, 2003) provide a theoretical framework that is consistent with a firm’s business strategy influencing its tax-planning strategy. Miles and Snow identify two distinct business strategies that, we argue, affect the level and aggressiveness of their tax avoidance. Defenders follow a cost leadership strategy, minimize their exposure to risk and uncertainty, strive to maintain organizational and operational stability, do not aggressively pursue new opportunities, carefully plan before making decisions, and sell products that have readily available substitutes. At the opposite extreme, Prospectors follow an innovation strategy, embrace uncertainty, undergo constant change, aggressively pursue new opportunities by entering into new product and geographic markets, often make decisions before formalizing plans, and tend to sell unique products that do not have viable substitutes.

To date, few tools have been specifically designed to measure empathy concerning dementia training. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a psychometrically valid and reliable tool to measure empathy among health professionals. A mixed methods sequential exploratory design was adopted guided by Fields' theoretical structure. Phase 1-4 (development) of the instrument was based on (1) an extensive literature review, (2) qualitative research, and (3-4) the contribution of a variety of stakeholders and supported by an empathic theoretical framework. Phase 5 (validation) involved a quantitative study among a convenient sample of multi-health professionals ( n = 223) to evaluate validity and reliability and finalize the tool. Full ethical approval was acquired. A 19-item questionnaire that includes four constructions (Previous training α = 0.88, empathy α = 0.91; Understanding behavior α = 0.85; and Person-centered practice α = 0.91) emerged from qualitative findings and a strong theoretical basis. It was verified that the tool had acceptable psychometric properties, acceptable factor loadings, and internal consistency measures. The intervention had a significant impact on the empathy of the participants. The tool proved to be an effective measure of empathy, understanding, and empathy in the performance of health professionals concerning the care of a person living with dementia. It proved to be an effective measure of change over time as a result of an intervention. The intervention produced a significant change in empathy and understanding of the symptoms and impact of dementia. This difference was observed regardless of the health profession. The empathy and understanding in the dementia index are potentially useful took for estimating empathy among health professionals using virtual reality. The questionnaire demonstrated sufficient structural validity and internal consistency in empathy and understanding of the symptoms of health professionals and the impact on the person living with dementia.

While technology enhances individual capability in many ways, how do we know that the sociotechnical system as a whole, consisting of a complex web of hundreds of human–machine interactions, is exhibiting collective intelligence? Research on human–machine interactions has been conducted within different disciplinary silos, resulting in social science models that underestimate technology and vice versa. Bringing together these different perspectives and methods at this juncture is critical. To truly advance our understanding of this important and quickly evolving area, we need vehicles to help research connect across disciplinary boundaries. This paper advocates for establishing an interdisciplinary research domain—Collective Human‐Machine Intelligence (COHUMAIN). It outlines a research agenda for a holistic approach to designing and developing the dynamics of sociotechnical systems. In illustrating the kind of approach, we envision in this domain, we describe recent work on a sociocognitive architecture, the transactive systems model of collective intelligence, that articulates the critical processes underlying the emergence and maintenance of collective intelligence and extend it to human–AI systems. We connect this with synergistic work on a compatible cognitive architecture, instance‐based learning theory and apply it to the design of AI agents that collaborate with humans.

Although there are many successful examples of HATs, researchers and technology developers can see additional applications if agents were better able to understand the mental states of humans to anticipate what a team is likely to do next. Creating this capability requires the creation of models of team interaction that enable agents to interpret a team’s current state and anticipate its future state. To build this model, we draw on research on collective intelligence (CI), which shows a team’s capability to work together can be characterized by a latent collective intelligence factor, based on observations of work across a range of tasks, and which predicts a team’s ability to accomplish a wide range of goals in the future. While some work uses a specific battery of CI tasks, more recent studies have identified observable collaborative process metrics that can be captured passively. Building on this work, we propose a method of evaluating CI by representing it as a latent variable represented by the hidden state in a Hidden Markov Model. The observations used as input to the model are the team’s observable collaborative process behaviors (i.e., collective effort, use of task-related skills, and task-strategy efficiency). We show by learning the set of hidden states representing a team’s observed collaborative process behaviors over time, we both learn information about the team’s CI, predict how CI will evolve in the future, and suggest when an agent might intervene to improve team performance. Based on the model’s observations, we discuss how it can help agents diagnose teamwork and possibly make interventions to improve CI by identifying areas of collaborative process (collective effort, skill use, or task strategy) that could be improved.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),85.23489932885906,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222003442,"M Zhao, FR Eadeh, TN Nguyen, P Gupta… - Computers in Human …, 2023 - Elsevier","Eadeh, F., Zhao, M., Nguyen, T., Gupta, P., Admoni, H., Gonzalez, C., & Woolley, A.

To date, however, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence. We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2), Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other highly autonomous AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents’ local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents’ behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.",Crossref,100.0,10.3390/e23070830,https://doi.org/10.3390/e23070830,Entropy,"Kaufmann, R., Gupta, P., & Taylor, J.

Awareness systems, which provide real-time visual feedback about team members’ behavior, may serve as an effective intervention tool for mitigating various sources of process-loss in teams, including team effort. However, most of the research on visualization tools has been focusing on team communication and learning, and their impact on team effort and consequently team performance has been hardly studied. Furthermore, this line of research has rarely addressed the way visualization tool may interact with team composition, while comprehension of this interaction may facilitate a conceptualization of more effective interventions. In this article we review the research on feedback in distributed teams and integrate it with the research on awareness systems. Focusing on team effort, we examine the effect of an effort visualization tool on team performance in 72 geographically distributed virtual project teams. In addition, we test the moderating effect of team composition, specifically team members’ conscientiousness, on the effectiveness of the effort visualization tool. Our findings demonstrate that the effort visualization tool increases team effort and improves the performance in teams with a low proportion of highly conscientious members, but not in teams with a high proportion of highly conscientious members.

This study investigates how this last-mile infrastructure may serve as an offline platform to connect customers and merchants in the physical world by leveraging walk-in traffic (organic interaction) and prompting interested customers through online intervention (induced interaction). Using free sample distribution as an example, we designed two large-scale studies in collaboration with Alibaba—an observational study across 1,032 stations and a randomized field experiment among 189,019 customers—to examine the causal effects of organic and induced interactions on customers’ subsequent online purchases from the focal brands, respectively. We found that induced interaction drives significantly more online sales than organic interaction. Under induced interaction, the online intervention effectively increases the number of free samples distributed. Nevertheless, the more significant increase in online sales for induced claimers is not simply due to more free samples distributed but because the induced customers are more interested and more likely to purchase. We identified this phenomenon as a screening mechanism that facilitates an advantageous selection of customers claiming the samples. Customers willing to pay the additional travel cost to claim samples are more likely to purchase the focal brands afterward. Finally, we developed a customized targeting framework using a generalized random forest model to enhance the effectiveness of induced interaction at the last-mile stations.

Academic/practical relevance: As COVID-19 continues to disrupt offline retail, anecdotal evidence suggests a rapid growth of e-commerce. However, the pandemic may also significantly decrease offline logistics capacity, which in turn decreases e-commerce sales. Then, how does e-commerce respond to COVID-19, and what are the corresponding opportunities and challenges? Methodology: We leverage e-commerce sales data from Alibaba and construct a city-day panel across three years, representing sales for all buyers and sellers on the platform across 339 cities in mainland China. We develop three identification strategies to estimate the overall impact of COVID-19 (based on a year-on-year comparison), the impact of COVID-19 intensity (based on the different number of cases across cities), and the impact of corresponding containment measures (leveraging policy changes of checkpoint, partial shutdown, and complete shutdown measures across cities). Results: We provide two key findings. First, across different identification strategies, we observe a common drop and recovery pattern, which illustrates the digital resilience of e-commerce during the pandemic. For example, we estimate an overall decrease of 22% in e-commerce sales during the period of the Wuhan shutdown (January 23–April 7, 2020). However, it recovers in most cities within five weeks. Second, we identify a key operational driver—logistics capacity—that significantly explains the decline and recovery of e-commerce sales during and after the outbreak.

However, because different subpopulations may respond differently to the same treatment, there is no a priori guarantee that the intervention will be as effective in the targeted population as it was in the study. How then should policy makers target individuals to maximize intervention effectiveness? We propose a novel robust optimization approach that leverages evidence typically available in a published study. Our model can be easily optimized in minutes for realistic instances with off-the-shelf software and is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of resource and fairness constraints. We compare our approach with current practice by proving performance guarantees for both approaches, which emphasize their structural differences. We also prove an intuitive interpretation of our model in terms of regularization, penalizing differences in the demographic distribution between targeted individuals and the study population. Although the precise penalty depends on the choice of uncertainty set, we show that for special cases we can recover classical penalties from the covariate matching literature on causal inference. Finally, using real data from a large teaching hospital, we compare our approach to common practice in the particular context of reducing emergency department utilization by Medicaid patients through case management.

In the accounting industry, small firms encounter coopetition when they align themselves with other independent firms to form accounting associations and networks (“AANs�?). AANs are a type of interorganizational relationship (“IOR�?) that provide opportunities for member firms to collaborate by sharing important resources such as expertise, best practices, and manpower. However, member firms also compete in the marketplace for clients and human capital, which incentivizes uncooperative and opportunistic behavior. If managed inadequately, coopetitive tensions can significantly hamper AAN benefits and may lead to IOR failure. Given the considerable longevity of AANs, we interview 42 high-level accounting professionals to understand AANs’ apparent successful management of these tensions. Leveraging coopetition and IOR theory, our analysis suggests that transactional mechanisms (contractual agreements, organizational structure, selection/monitoring processes) and relational mechanisms (trust, social ties, reciprocity) play key roles in encouraging healthy cooperation and competition among member firms. One of our main conclusions is that these mechanisms contribute to AAN success because they are leveraged comprehensively across each IOR life cycle phase, and they are mutually reinforcing with transactional mechanisms providing the foundation to inspire confidence and encourage the development of relational mechanisms. Our research enriches existing accounting and coopetition literature, provides a new perspective for AANs, and responds to calls to understand key factors of IOR success.",Semantic Scholar ,93.38235294117646,10.2139/ssrn.3266544,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b87d5d2e395152f90f900b8be2e1395f43bb9588,Contemporary Accounting Research,"Bills, K., Hayne, C., & Stein, S.

Traditional approaches using self-reports or performance-based proxies have limited researchers’ ability to study how management control systems influence behavior through effort. Using a controlled experiment with a decoding task, we examine how piece-rate versus flat-wage compensation influences effort intensity and performance. Our findings show that pupil dilation partially mediates the relationship between incentives and performance, with this mediation strongest in early experimental rounds before weakening over time. This dynamic pattern suggests that while incentives initially influence performance through effort intensity, other mechanisms such as implicit learning emerge in later rounds.

The implications of discretionary adjustments for employees' future efforts and fairness perceptions present important trade‐offs for managers to consider. Adjustments may be used to motivate different types of effort in future periods, but may also create perceptions of unfairness among employees who are not affected by negative events. This study examines the joint influence of the likelihood of future negative uncontrollable events and compensation interdependence (i.e., the extent to which one employee's compensation influences others' compensation) on managers' willingness to make adjustments for the effect of a negative uncontrollable event on a single employee. In our experiment, we manipulate the likelihood of future uncontrollable events and whether bonuses are determined individually or are drawn from a shared bonus pool. Results show that managers are less willing to adjust when the likelihood of future events is high to avoid setting a precedent, thereby motivating employees to adapt to changing conditions. We also find that managers are less willing to adjust, regardless of event likelihood, when compensation interdependence is high, to avoid demotivating unaffected employees. Finally, we find that participants' general attitudes toward compensation significantly influence their adjustment decisions beyond the effects of our independent variables.

Transparency created by the signing of EOI agreements is expected to reduce the tax-motivated shifting of income by multinational corporations. Whether such agreements affect the income-shifting behaviour of multinational corporations is an unanswered question. The authors find evidence that, on average, EOI agreements do have an impact on tax-motivated income shifting. Additionally, they find that more advanced, modern EOI agreements are associated with a larger decrease in tax-motivated income shifting compared to the impact of early EOI agreements. This evidence challenges the prevalent assumption in empirical studies that EOI agreements are homogeneous. Supplemental analyses suggest that factors that affect the information asymmetry between MNEs and tax authorities, such as corporations with high levels of intangibles and tax authorities with strong transfer-pricing rules and enforcement, can diminish or enhance the effectiveness of EOI agreements in moderating tax-motivated income shifting.

In and of itself, that shouldn’t surprise anyone. My first accounting class was in the early 1990s, and we learned how to: write a journal entry into a general or specialized journal, post that entry to a ledger, foot the totals for each account in the ledger, transfer the totals to a trial balance, and use the trial balance to compile basic financial statements, all by hand (and in pencil—too many potential mistakes to use pen!). Today, nearly all that knowledge is either obsolete or close to it. Certainly, these are still important steps in the accounting process! But we no longer need to do all of this manually. Today, we have multiple tools that can automatically record most of the information that we collect, and accounting and analytics software that help us interpret and report the results of an organization’s efforts. Technology has enabled accountants to relegate the repetitive, mundane tasks to software and computers, which has freed up our time for much more interesting and engaging work. Of course, advances in technology have also led to major changes in the world in which we, as accountants, function. These changes have been so fundamental that they’re being referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. Following closely on the heels of the third industrial revolution—which encompassed the digitization of much of the information that we use—this may be the first time in recorded history that the same people are experiencing multiple industrial revolutions. The point is that “change” has become the new normal. The world is now in a constant state of change.

This step-up imposes tax liabilities on pre-IPO owners, but also creates significant future tax benefits for the firm; the average anticipated deferred tax asset is $486 million ($13 per share) for our sample of supercharged IPO firms. Pursuant to tax receivable agreements, supercharged IPO firms pay a large portion of these tax benefits to pre-IPO owners as they are realized in the future. Future firm performance must be sufficiently strong for the IPO firm and the pre-IPO owners to realize the future tax benefits created by the supercharged transaction structure.

We argue that task structures, which capture how tasks are allocated and configured within organizations, significantly affect peer interactions and influence. Specifically, we examine how two features of task structures—task variety and task similarity with peers—moderate peer influence in a highly consequential setting: physicians’ decisions to perform a birth via caesarean section (C-section) versus vaginal delivery. Using data on nearly 5 million births performed by more than 16,500 physicians across 915 hospitals in Brazil, we find that working alongside peers whose practice style (enduring preference) favors C-sections leads the focal physician to perform more C-sections, even after controlling for features of the mother and the pregnancy. This influence is significantly stronger for physicians with higher task variety and with higher task similarity with peers. Through post-hoc analyses, we provide evidence that the observed behaviors are consistent with a mechanism of information sharing between physicians.

We theorize that incumbent firms can overcome scarcity of skilled human capital in local labor markets by redeploying workers from existing units. We predict that redeployment is more valuable when factor markets exhibit large differences in resource scarcity. Redeployment is also more valuable when output is highly sensitive to worker skill and is responsive to complementarities between labor and other inputs. Important implications are that redeployment can endow firms with superior resources and enable them to enter more markets. Data on sugar mills in Brazil, where a sudden demand boom incentivized expansion, corroborate the predictions. Our research identifies a new mechanism of value‐creation from resource redeployment across factor markets. Managerial Summary Firms entering underdeveloped regions often struggle to obtain inputs needed for production, such as skilled labor. We propose that incumbent firms expanding into such regions can overcome resource scarcity by redeploying resources from their existing units. Redeployment allows firms to move resources—such as skilled workers—from markets where resources are relatively abundant to markets where they are scarce. We show that such factor market “arbitrage” is most valuable when firms operate across markets with large differences in resource scarcity and when production is sensitive to worker skill and to complementarities between inputs. By redeploying into markets suffering from resource scarcity, firms can enter more markets and seed units with superior resources. This gives incumbent firms with redeployment capabilities an advantage over de novo entrants.",Crossref,98.55072463768116,10.1002/smj.3627,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3627,Strategic Management Journal,"Chauvin, J., Inoue, C., & Poliquin, C.

Drawing on theoretical views about the relationship between politicians and firms, I argue that state officials seeking votes manipulate SOEs to boost employment before elections. As a result, SOEs exhibit both higher employment levels and lower financial performance in election years. The positive relationship between elections and SOE employment, however, is not uniform across firms and geographic communities: it is likely to be stronger in economically disadvantaged communities and weaker for SOEs with private investors. Data from Brazil’s water sector—an industry managing a crucial societal resource—support these predictions. These results shed light on the mechanisms linking officials’ political incentives and SOE behavior and show that SOE performance is politically contingent and thus varies systematically over time. More broadly, this study reveals how firms’ responses to political pressures depend on both organizational and community attributes and highlights how the interplay of election cycles, organizations, and communities shapes the performance of organizations in state capitalism.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/0001839219869913,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839219869913,Administrative Science Quarterly,"Inoue, C.

A Data Analytic Approach to System Design,"Ivanov, Anton",2024,"Online retail platforms are increasingly challenged by the proliferation of low-quality products, which may damage their reputation and sales. To address this problem, we propose a system architecture to proactively identify products that are likely to go “out of favor.” Our approach uses historical data to extract useful information from customer ratings and textual reviews. Available data are fed into a state-of-the-art deep learning sequence model to forecast future ratings. We then analyze rating trends, extracting hyperparameters that a binary classifier uses to label products as “out-of-favor” or not. We tested this system on an Amazon dataset comprising nearly 800,000 observations across 2826 electronics products. Our results show that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model excels in forecasting future product ratings compared to other benchmarks. Ablation analysis shows sentiment-related features significantly improve rating forecasts by up to 40%, with review topics adding 10% and other review characteristics, 4%. Counterintuitively, topic extraction from reviews does not provide substantial benefits, despite the heavy computational resources it requires. Finally, the two-stage classification process, which leverages time-series data and rating trends, offers a more stable and robust performance than conventional single-stage methods. We provide considerations for system architecture development through robustness checks ensuring its resilience to stressors. Our experiments indicate that rating trends can change in subtle ways over time, leading a promising “star” product to turn into a liability (“dog”). E-commerce platforms can use the proposed system architecture proactively to identify and remove potentially dubious products instead of waiting to take reactive action.",Crossref,91.96428571428571,10.1177/10591478241282327,https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241282327,Production and Operations Management,"Ivanov, A., Ghoshal, A., & Kumar, A.

We construct a unique panel dataset combining data collected from multiple public and proprietary sources. To operationalize visual nudges from user‐generated content, we engage in extensive manual classification of images collected from Instagram (IG), Twitter (TW), and Facebook (FB). To examine the relationship between visual nudging and COVID‐19 positivity, we rely on a combination of econometric and epidemiological models. We find that when institutional actors share more images containing mask‐related information on IG, their COVID‐19 positivity rates decrease by up to 25%, on average. Also, given the fragmentary evidence behind FB and TW effects, our results provide suggestive evidence of the “boundary condition” of the visual nudge effect. Finally, empirical evidence indicates the dynamic and curvilinear effect of visual nudges on positivity over time, such that the informational value of visual nudging is most prominent if communicated 3 to 5 weeks ahead of time, on average.

Yet, training algorithms on imbalanced datasets may severely affect performance on unseen data. For example, in some cases in healthcare, fintech, or cybersecurity contexts, certain subclasses are difficult to learn because they are underrepresented in training data. Our study offers a flexible and efficient solution based on a new synthetic average neighborhood sampling algorithm (SANSA), which, in contrast to other solutions, introduces a novel “placement” parameter that can be tuned to adapt to each dataset’s unique manifestation of the imbalance. This package can be downloaded for R 1 . We tested SANSA against seven existing sampling methods used in conjunction with the four most frequently used machine learning models trained on 14 benchmark datasets. Our results provide suggestive evidence that SANSA offers a feasible solution to the imbalance problem for most datasets.

Although addressing addiction—the heart of this problem—ought to remain a priority for health practitioners, examining the community-level psychological factors with a known impact on health behaviors may provide valuable insights for attenuating this health crisis by curbing risky behaviors before they evolve into addiction. Objective The goal of this study is twofold: to demonstrate the relationship between community-level psychological traits and fatal opioid overdose both theoretically and empirically, and to provide a blueprint for using social media data to glean these psychological factors in a real-time, reliable, and scalable manner. Methods We collected annual panel data from Twitter for 2891 counties in the United States between 2014-2016 and used a novel data mining technique to obtain average county-level “Big Five” psychological trait scores. We then performed interval regression, using a control function to alleviate omitted variable bias, to empirically test the relationship between county-level psychological traits and the prevalence of fatal opioid overdoses in each county. Results After controlling for a wide range of community-level biopsychosocial factors related to health outcomes, we found that three of the operationalizations of the five psychological traits examined at the community level in the study were significantly associated with fatal opioid overdoses: extraversion (β=.308, P Conclusions Analyzing the psychological characteristics of a community can be a valuable tool in the local, state, and national fight against the opioid pandemic.

While “reputation signaling” via online user engagement is commonplace, its implications in the context of user-generated content (UGC) remain largely unaddressed. This study empirically explores the impact of UGC on hospital reputational dynamics. A unique panel dataset was analyzed using a lagged model approach to determine the effects of signals of quality, awareness, and content variance on hospital prominence and quality as well as the impact of reputation on financial performance. The findings suggest that quality signals significantly impact patient-perceived quality ratings, and signals of awareness and content variance significantly impact prominence rating. Also, in contrast to prominence, perceived quality significantly impacts financial performance. Given the ready availability of user-generated feedback, these findings can inform patient-provider online engagement strategies and related budget allocations.

We conduct an experiment to test our hypotheses that members in a group with a connector (versus without) have lower turnover intentions because their experiences are perceived as more positive, and that this turnover intention effect is more pronounced for group members who are demographically distinct from others in their group. Results are consistent with predictions, although the effect of connectors on lowering group members’ turnover intentions is driven by members who are distinct.

We examine the possibility of a conflict between the intermediary and its borrower on rehypothecation arrangements.

We propose that religion may play an important role in the spatial arrangement of industries and can explain why regions with similar resources do not produce similar clusters. We advance a theory predicting a suppressive effect of religion on the development of industrial clusters in morally controversial industries. We argue that in such industries, regions dominated by denominations that treat controversial industries as immoral will experience lower firm entry rates, compared to regions with a lower presence of such denominations. We theorize about three underlying processes. First, in regions dominated by religious groups opposing a controversial industry, negative attitudes of religious actors generate social environments unfavorable to businesses in this industry. Second, there could be an ecological effect of religion wherein the suppressive impact of a focal region’s oppositional religiosity is mitigated when neighboring regions have higher oppositional religiosity than that of the focal region. Finally, in regions with high oppositional religiosity, religious social movements are likely to emerge to target a controversial industry and its participants, which should further repel potential entrants.

Recent research has found that a firm can facilitate the discovery and subsequent purchase of its product by giving it an advantageous name. However, no product exists in isolation, rather it competes for customer attention with other products both within and across product niches. We theorize that a product may benefit from the names of competitors’ products within its niche because certain product names can trigger a positive spillover effect. Specifically, product viability should increase with the proliferation of products with informative names in a focal niche because informative names attract attention to the niche, and consequently benefit all its products, regardless of whether they have informative names or not. This beneficial influence should be especially strong when a niche is new. Additionally, a product’s market fate may depend not only on the prevalent naming practices in its niche, but also on naming practices in competing niches. We find support for our theorizing in event‐history analyses of all CD‐drive products shipped in the worldwide optical disk drive industry, 1983–1999.

Many new markets emerge in direct ideological opposition to incumbent industries. Yet, the ways in which ideology affects products in oppositional markets are not well understood. We propose that when audiences cannot easily differentiate between products based on physical attributes, they rely on ideological discourse about the production process. We argue that product names, by embodying linguistically the narrative of this discourse, shape the appeal of oppositional products to customers. When products have names that are congruent with the collective identity of an oppositional market, they have higher appeal. This beneficial effect is attenuated (1) when audience expectations about what type of product should have an oppositional name are violated and (2) when a firm develops a strong organizational identity and audiences rely on this identity to make inference about the firm’s production process.

Theoretically, we show that the value of a growth option increases in idiosyncratic volatility but its response to volatility of aggregate shocks can be either positive or negative depending on option moneyness. Empirically, we show that price sensitivity to variation in idiosyncratic volatility carries significant information about firms’ future investment and growth even after controlling for conventional proxies of growth options such as book-to-market and other relevant firm characteristics. Consistent with our theoretical arguments, we also find that firm’ exposure to aggregate volatility, while priced, does not help predict their future growth.

When a new market disrupts a firm’s standing routines, greater operating experience with these routines complicates adaptation and increases the firm’s uncertainty about the feasibility of entering, thereby delaying its entry. Yet, this entry uncertainty simultaneously prompts the firm to rely more heavily on learning from the observation of others entering which, in turn, hastens its entry. Patterns are opposite for firms that can leverage their standing routines into the new market. Here, greater operating experience and resultant momentum to extrapolate existing routines reduce a firm’s uncertainty about the feasibility of entry. This directly accelerates their entry but also diminishes the indirect, accelerating influence of observational learning. Because of these opposite dynamics, entry rates between firms with these different types of prior operating experience begin to diminish. Empirical analysis of entry patterns into the deregulation-created electric power trading market supports our theory and calls for modifications to previous expectations of prior operating experience exerting either a purely delaying or accelerating effect on entry, and, further, draws attention to the indirect pathways through which prior experience shapes entry patterns.",Crossref,99.49238578680203,10.1093/icc/dtab020,https://doi.org/10.1093/icc/dtab020,Industrial and Corporate Change,"Terlaak, A., & Kim, J.

At the organizational level, corporate purpose can thus be articulated as a distinctive and meaningful intent to enhance the lives of people. We identify four strategic issues to consider in reconstituting a corporation’s purpose: corporate governance, strategic leadership, stakeholder engagement, and implementation.

Consistent with accounts of social disorganization and declining social capital, SLA managers abandoned mutual for corporate enterprise as SLAs became less locally embedded, and where communities experienced disorganization and declining working- or cross-class associationalism. Yet conversions also depended on elite detachment, civic reorganization, bifurcation within communities, and “upwardly oriented” associations that helped SLA managers reorient SLAs from Main Street to Wall Street.

While these events bear an intuitive connection to corporate reputation, several scholars have raised questions about the role of discrete exchanges in overall evaluations of firms. Additionally, scholars have neither systematically examined such effects nor elaborated a formal theory thereof. The present paper fills this gap by developing and testing a middle range theory of this important yet poorly understood relationship. This theory identifies the psychological mechanism (trait attribution) which underlies this relationship and explains how discrete, stakeholder-specific exchange failures can damage reputations of larger corporate entities. It also explains how social and historical information associated with failed exchanges can affect this process. We elaborate and test this theory through a study of the effects of quarterly earnings misses on firms’ standing in the Fortune “Most Admired Company” survey. Consistent with our theory, earnings misses did damage firm standing. However, misses did not invariably produce reputational damage and, as predicted, their effects were contingent on associated social (e.g., peer firm reliability, institutional context) and historical (e.g., the firm’s track record and statements) information.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.46341463414635,,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2010.0968,"EG Love, MS Kraatz - Academy of Management Journal, 2017 - journals.aom.org","Love, E., & Kraatz, M.

These penalties should deter questionable behavior and enable reputation to serve a social control function, yet we know little about how and when these penalties are actually imposed.

Specifically, we develop theory to explain how and when stock analysts and peer executives applied reputational penalties to managers when firms used a poison pill, a prominent anti-takeover device. We find that the reputational penalties associated with poison pills differed substantially between these two groups and that these groups applied different penalties depending on the media coverage that the poison pill received, the performance of the firm, and the extent to which the practice had already been adopted.

We attribute this productivity drop to two mechanisms: reduced investment in productivity-augmenting technology, and inefficient allocation of resources across a firm’s plants.

Returns for high reaching-for-yield funds nevertheless tend to be negative on a risk-adjusted basis.

Analysis of GPS big data collected from vehicles can provide useful insights about the quantity and distribution of such energy consumption and emissions. Previous studies, which estimated fuel consumption/emissions from traffic based on GPS sampled data, have not sufficiently considered vehicle activities and may have led to erroneous estimations. By adopting the analytical construct of the space-time path in time geography, this study proposes methods that more accurately estimate and visualize vehicle energy consumption/emissions based on analysis of vehicles’ mobile activities (MA) and stationary activities (SA). First, we build space-time paths of individual vehicles, extract moving parameters, and identify MA and SA from each space-time path segment (STPS). Then we present an N-Dimensional framework for estimating and visualizing fuel consumption/emissions. For each STPS, fuel consumption, hot emissions, and cold start emissions are estimated based on activity type, i.e., MA, SA with engine-on and SA with engine-off. In the case study, fuel consumption and emissions of a single vehicle and a road network are estimated and visualized with GPS data. The estimation accuracy of the proposed approach is 88.6%. We also analyze the types of activities that produced fuel consumption on each road segment to explore the patterns and mechanisms of fuel consumption in the study area. The results not only show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in estimating fuel consumption/emissions but also indicate their advantages for uncovering the relationships between fuel consumption and vehicles’ activities in road networks.",Crossref,82.43243243243244,10.3390/ijerph15040566,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15040566,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Kwan, M., Zhang, X., Tang, L., & Kan, Z.

The spatial, social, and mobility transformations that Chinese cities have experienced over the past decades are unprecedented in human history. Accompanying improved living standards and expanded life space evidenced by the prevalence of gated communities and automobility are social polarization and environmental deterioration. It is argued that the urban development experiences of China are distinctive in terms of pace, scale, and magnitude. Studying the issues that are emerging in urban China will enrich theories that have mostly been developed from the experiences of Western cities (Kwan, Chai, & Tana, 2014). This motivated us to organize several sessions on spatiotemporal studies of Chinese urban life at the 2011 AAG annual meeting in Seattle, and to further develop the idea for this special feature, which includes three selected papers.
The paper by Zhou et al investigates the jobs-housing balance/imbalance issue concerning the so-called development zone in the Chinese city Suzhou. The “development zone” has been a common feature of urban development in many large Chinese cities over the past few decades (Cartier, 2001). They are usually located in suburban areas, and planned as selfcontained with the objective of jobs-housing balance. In reality, however, the planning objective is often not achieved and people who work in development zones have to commute long distances. This paper provides an empirical study to illustrate this problem and probe the reasons behind it. It examines the case of Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), and reveals that SIP commuters suffer longer commuting distance than their Suzhou counterparts. The processes highlighted by this study include the unaffordable price of housing at the development zone, shortage of land supply for residential use, and increased private car ownership that facilitates long commutes. The study foregrounds the planning-versusmarket perspective to enhance our understanding of human mobility and land use patterns in urban China. The study also contributes to the debate about whether jobs-housing balance can be achieved through planning measures when housing choice is basically market-driven (Horner, 2002; Peng, 1997). While jobs-housing balance is an issue concerning urban form and transportation at the district or city level, the connection between built environment and travel behavior is often examined at the neighborhood scale, which is a major topic in travel behavior research (Handy, Cao, & Mokhtarian, 2005; Wang & Lin, 2014). Characteristics of neighborhood built environments, including design, diversity, and access to public transit, have been reported to be important determinants of travel behavior in terms of vehicle miles traveled and the use of nonmotorized transport mode (Ewing & Cervero, 2010). The paper by Liu et al extends this stream of research to address another important issue about urban living: neighborhood built environment, daily travel, and carbon emission. It examines the extent to which neighborhood built environment may contribute to the reduction of travel-related CO2 emissions.

By dialing 311, urban residents can report a range of public issues that require governmental attention, including potholes, graffito, sanitation complaints, and tree debris. The demand for these municipal services fluctuates greatly with time and location, which poses multiple challenges to effective deployment of limited resources. To address these challenges, this study uses a locally adaptive space-time kernel approach to model 311 requests as an inhomogeneous Poisson process and presents an analytical framework to generate predictions of 311 demand in space and time. The predictions can be used to optimally allocate resources and staff, reduce response time, and allow long-term dynamic planning. We use a bivariate spatial kernel to identify the spatial structure and weigh each kernel by corresponding past observations to capture the temporal dynamics. Short-term serial dependency and weekly temporality are modeled through the temporal weights, which are adaptive to local community areas. We also transform the computation-intensive parameter estimation procedure to a low dimensional optimization problem by fitting to the autocorrelation function of historical requests. The presented method is demonstrated and validated with sanitation service requests in Chicago.

Managers face a strategic dilemma when making capital investments within the macro-economic cycle: even though resources may be scarce during downturns, firms with managerial capabilities can exploit factor markets to make profitable investments. We first show that managers recognise the importance of investing through economic downturns (i.e., investing counter-cyclically), but we also hypothesise and show that firms invest less during economic contractions (i.e., they do not invest counter-cyclically). We then hypothesise and find that performance is declining in investment, suggesting that contingent factors may influence successful capital investments. Our main hypothesis and test demonstrate that firms increasing capital investment during macro-economic downturns experience greater forward performance over one, two, and three-year horizons. We also show that the underlying mechanisms of this increased performance may be the temporal orientation (i.e., investment horizon) of strategic capital allocation and the firm's dependence on external sources of financing. The analyses in this paper suggest that executives should make capital investments when it is perhaps the most difficult to do so.",Semantic Scholar ,90.0,10.1504/gber.2021.115802,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7bfba2e365ef9f4d85bdb8984119b656b244f298,Global Business and Economics Review (GBER),"Larson, E., & Vieregger, C.

However, deriving benefits from these implementations has proved to be a challenge, and a great deal of variation has been observed in the extent of value generated for client and vendor firms. This research examines the role of co-specialization as a strategy to make the most out of outsourced enterprise systems. The authors develop hypotheses relating resource co-specialization with two indicators of success for implementation of enterprise software: (1) exchange success and (2) firm growth.
The hypotheses are tested using a unique panel data set of 175 firms adopting Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) software, a type of enterprise system used for managing manufacturing and logistics. The authors identify organizational factors that support co-specialization and then examine how co-specialization is associated with enterprise software implementation success, controlling for the endogenous choice to co-specialize.
The empirical results suggest that resource co-specialization is positively associated with implementation success and that the two resource co-specialization pathways that are examined complement each other in providing performance benefits.

Capital resource allocation is one of the most important tasks of the top management team (TMT), yet management scholars have yet to explore the fundamental link between TMT structure and resource reallocation decisions. We hypothesize that greater BU influence within the firm’s TMT drives greater reallocation because BU executives are positioned to focus on organizational elements related to differentiation. We also hypothesize contextual factors, based on the multidimensional nature of managerial influence, which act to limit the effect of BU influence. To support this analysis, we develop two unique measures: The first captures the degree of capital reallocation from year to year within the multibusiness firm, and the second measures the relative influence of BU executives.

In assessing competence, auditors encounter cues diagnostic of the specialist’s social status but less so of competence. In an experiment, we manipulate specialist status and find that auditors mistake status for competence unless they are prompted to separate the constructs. This raises the possibility that auditors could over-rely on high-status specialists. However, auditors also assess high-status specialists as more influential, and when the specialist disagrees with the client, they rely more on high-status specialists because of this perceived influence. Thus, high-status specialists can increase auditors’ willingness to challenge the client by providing a strong ally. Additional analyses suggest that auditors are aware that they rely on the specialist’s influence rather than competence, indicating that auditors do not use the process that auditing standards envision to evaluate and rely on specialists.

We focus on rewards for costly skepticism: skepticism that is ex ante appropriate, but generates incremental ex post costs and does not identify a misstatement. Auditors interpret a reward for costly skepticism as a better-than-expected outcome and view subsequent tasks from a risk-averse gain frame. As a result, auditors seek to avoid the downside risk of skeptical action, which decreases auditors' sensitivity to red flags and their willingness to communicate severe red flags to their managers, compromising audit quality. However, we also find that a supervisor consistently rewarding costly skepticism decreases auditors' risk aversion and increases their skepticism.

Capturing vacancy duration using the creation and deletion dates of job postings by US public firms, we examine the informativeness of vacancy duration for future firm profitability. We find that while firms that quickly fill low-skill job vacancies exhibit higher future profitability, firms that take more time to fill high-skill jobs exhibit higher future profitability. Our cross-sectional analyses across the benefits and costs of candidate selection and performance expectations suggest that the informativeness of vacancy duration comes from its reflection of firms’ hiring strategies. That is, firms expecting higher profitability recruit more intensively to avoid the opportunity cost associated with vacancies for low-skill jobs and to ensure the selection of high-quality workers for high-skill jobs. Further analyses show that the implication of job vacancy duration for future profitability is not incorporated timely in the capital markets, as evidenced by pessimistic analyst forecasts and positive earnings announcement returns in future quarters for firms with short (long) durations for low-skill (high-skill) jobs.

Using target and actual compensation earnings-per-share disclosed in proxy statements of large U.S. public firms, we find operating cash flows have no significant incremental effects on the revision of future earnings targets in the presence of current earnings. We observe a positive association between future target achievability and current operating cash flows, indicating that firms with higher operating cash flows set significantly easier future earnings targets for CEOs. These findings suggest that the higher persistence of operating cash flows in predicting future earnings is not fully incorporated into target setting.

Using proxy statement disclosure on performance goals for CEOs of U.S. public companies, we find that lower thresholds and higher maximums are associated with greater corporate risk taking, and these results are more pronounced when CEOs have greater incentives to achieve accounting performance goals or have lower innate risk aversion. In addition, we find that target difficulty is not significantly associated with corporate risk taking after controlling for thresholds and maximums. Finally, we find that CEO compensation contracts are more likely to have lower thresholds and higher maximums when risk taking is more value-enhancing or when R&D investment is more profitable, consistent with boards setting performance goals to induce an appropriate amount of corporate risk taking. Our study contributes to the accounting literature on target setting and corporate risk taking by identifying accounting performance goals as a tool in executive compensation contract design to influence risk taking.

This study examines how integrating additional data and advanced machine learning enhances default prediction in this sector. We merge loan records with credit bureau data and compare four variable sets: credit scores alone; loan-specific variables alone; a combination of credit scores and loan variables; and an integration of credit scores, loan variables and more than 300 credit bureau variables selected via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression. Our findings show that credit scores alone yield limited accuracy (with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.6), while incorporating loan-specific features significantly improves performance. Further including selected credit bureau variables and tuning hyperparameters boosts predictive power, with a random forest model achieving an AUC of 0.854. Key predictors include credit scores, the loan amount, loan duration, months since the oldest trade, and recent credit inquiries.

By analyzing approval rates, rate spreads, and origination charges, we evaluate how borrower outcomes vary by race and ethnicity, controlling for loan characteristics, borrower attributes, and regional factors. Our findings reveal that Black and Hispanic borrowers consistently face less favorable terms than White borrowers, with disparities differing by lender type. Large banks, operating under stringent regulatory oversight, demonstrate relatively equitable pricing but impose higher loan denial rates on minorities. Credit unions, despite offering the lowest rate spreads overall, penalize minority borrowers more severely in pricing than other lender types. Fintech lenders, while charging higher-rate spreads and fees, show smaller credit access disparities for minority borrowers. Non-bank and small banks display mixed results, with inconsistencies in their treatment of minorities across pricing and credit access. These results highlight that neither technological innovations nor alternative lending models alone suffice to eliminate systemic inequities.

COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented level of volatility in the labor market variables, leading to new challenges to use UR in the credit risk modeling framework. This paper examines the dynamic relationship between the credit card charge-off rate and the unemployment rate over time.

Univariate, multivariable, machine learning, and regime-switching time series modeling are employed in this research. Findings The authors decompose UR into two components – temporary and permanent UR. The authors find the spike in UR during COVID-19 is mainly attributed to the surge in temporary layoffs. More importantly, the authors find that the credit card charge-off rate is primarily driven by permanent UR while temporary UR has little predictive power. During recessions, permanent UR seems to be a stronger indicator than total UR. This research highlights the importance of using permanent UR for credit risk modeling.

Methodology – A sample of European banks (27 member countries of the European Union plus U.K.) over the period of 2005 to 2019 are used in this study. Liquidity risk is measured by the ratio of liquid assets to total assets. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors use panel regression with bank fixed effects to control for unobserved characteristics that might affect the dependent variable. Findings – The authors find that banks holding more liquid assets take less risk and show a higher subsequent loan growth rate. These results hold for both small and large banks. Novelty – To the authors’ best knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies to carefully examine the effects of liquidity risk on risk-taking behavior and loan growth rate for European banks.

Yet the way in which people connect over food is changing. Rising health concerns, due in part to the increase in food allergies and obesity, have shifted attention away from the social aspects of food to food's nutritional aspects. Recognizing the social context in which food consumption takes place, this article reviews research highlighting the interpersonal consequences of joint food consumption. We first examine research on how sharing food connects people together, both via the type of food consumed (e.g., incidental food similarity) and the manner in which people serve and eat food (e.g., from shared vs. separate plates). We then turn to research that addresses the opposite side of the coin, discussing how the inability to share in a meal can be isolating, as well as how people navigate conflicting preferences when making food decisions with others. We conclude with a discussion of promising future directions for research on joint food consumption.",Crossref,92.5,10.1111/spc3.12748,https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12748,Social and Personality Psychology Compass,"Woolley, K., & Lim, S.

Ten studies reveal that, in contrast to managers’ predictions, consumers react less positively when a favorable decision is made by an algorithmic (vs. a human) decision maker, whereas this difference is mitigated for an unfavorable decision. The effect is driven by distinct attribution processes: it is easier for consumers to internalize a favorable decision outcome that is rendered by a human than by an algorithm, but it is easy to externalize an unfavorable decision outcome regardless of the decision maker type.

The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) advocates for International Educational Standards (IES) that define essential professional skills to be cultivated across undergraduate accounting programs, from foundational to advanced levels. This study employed the modified Delphi method to explore professors’ perceptions regarding the development of professional skills within the Brazilian Introductory Accounting Education. Findings reveal significant gaps: only 32.14% of expected skills showed substantial development, while 53.57% were identified as lacking in current educational practices. These results indicate a notable misalignment with recommendations from IFAC, impacting the initial professional formation of students vis-à-vis global benchmarks. The study underscores the urgency for educators, pedagogical counselors, and policymakers to enhance pedagogical strategies, focusing on professional skills development. Addressing these findings can help align Brazilian accounting education more closely with (inter)national standards, while also encouraging other countries to focus on the effective implementation of IES. This better equips students with the essential skills required to thrive in a dynamic and evolving professional landscape, improving their readiness for the job market and enhancing the global relevance and quality of accounting education.",Semantic Scholar ,100.0,10.1080/09639284.2025.2541183,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2092b32c2d59691f3734d32429568c3463f3b5b,Accounting Education,"Cerqueira Lima, H., & Lima, G.

High-quality audits lead to improved financial reporting, fraud detection, and lower costs of capital. Market reactions are positive when reputable audit firms are involved. However, outcomes may vary by industry and country, depending on regulatory and institutional factors. Implications to Theory, Practice and Policy: Agency theory, signaling theory and information risk and auditor reputation theory may be use to anchor future studies on assessing the effect of audit quality on earnings management practices.

In this study, we therefore evaluated the association between chief executive officer (CEO) NARC and TA in Brazilian public firms. By focusing on Brazil, an emerging economy regulated by code law, our investigation makes an important contribution to the accounting literature on TA. Most studies examining the relation between corporate TA and CEO personality profile have been conducted in common law countries. According to the literature, TA behaviors are influenced by tax system specifics. In addition, the home country’s level of economic development should be taken into account when quantifying corporate TA. These observations, and the lack of previous investigation focusing on Brazil, ratify the relevance of the study. Our study also provides tax authorities, auditors, and investors with tools to identify narcissistic behaviors predictive of corporate TA, which may demand precautionary measures on part of business partners. The sample consisted of 68 Brazilian public firms (382 observations), covering the period 2010-2017, and a robust regression model with panel data was used. TA and NARC were measured with secondary data according to the literature. Our findings show a positive correlation between CEO NARC and TA. Executives with this personality trait come across as bold or aggressive, thus more prone to adopt TA strategies, as confirmed in the present study.

Moderate traits of the Dark Triad and profit maximization","Lima, Gerlando",2018,"ABSTRACT This article analyzes the relationship between the maximization of personal and company gains and the moderate traits of the Dark Triad. The relevance of choosing this topic lies in investigating the attitude of executives who exhibit characteristics of a moderate intensity between the strong and weak traits. It is proven that the vision and charisma of narcissistic individuals, the strategy and tactics of Machiavellian individuals, and the creativity and good strategic thinking of psychopathic individuals are differentiating characteristics that enhance successful and integrative leadership and that are far from the more accentuated and opportunistic attitudes related to the strong traits, whose practices involve dishonest actions for personal gain. This evidence creates the possibility for strengthening the research in the accounting area, especially on the behavioral approach, in order to promote its interface with psychology and clarify how personality, values, and experiences influence managers’ choices when conducting business and how workers and companies are impacted by these decisions. The study is empirical-theoretical and involves 263 managers, adopting a survey as its data collection strategy and applying a self-reporting type questionnaire. The data analysis approaches included descriptive statistics, correlations, tests of means, and logistic regressions. In this study, managers with moderate psychopathic traits showed a lower tendency to maximize profit by manipulating results. An opposite tendency was revealed for those with moderate Machiavellian traits. The combined effect of the three Dark Triad traits was significant and positive, revealing opportunistic profit maximization. These findings contribute to future studies that aim to systematically analyze moderate levels of the triad and corroborate the findings that have revealed the common characteristics of manipulation, callousness, and dishonesty when investigating the interactive effect between the traits in question.",Crossref,100.0,10.1590/1808-057x201806020,https://doi.org/10.1590/1808-057x201806020,Revista Contabilidade &amp; Finanças,"Lima, G., F.

National culture was proxied by six dimensions: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism, masculinity, long-term orientation, and indulgence. IFRS reduced the cost of equity capital when national culture was not included in the regression, and when power distance was included. Cost of equity capital was low in countries with high levels of uncertainty avoidance and indulgence. Our main finding is that the cost of equity capital tends to be low in countries with IFRS and long-term orientation. The fact that IFRS-related benefits (such as improved information quality and reduced cost of equity capital) may be compromised by components of national culture should be taken into account by investors and analysts in their forecasts and investment decisions.",Crossref,91.66666666666667,10.2308/jiar-52192,https://doi.org/10.2308/jiar-52192,Journal of International Accounting Research,"Diógenes Góis, A., Lima, G., Contrera Malacrida, M., & Sousa, N.

The outlined arguments on the subject are based on the assumption that consistent voluntary disclosure policies may reduce earnings management. The analysis is conducted on a random sample of 66 non-financial Brazilian listed companies in the 2005-2012 period. To measure voluntary disclosure, the index proposed by Consoni and Colauto (2016) is used. As a proxy for earnings management, discretionary accruals (DA) are estimated based on the model by Dechow, Sloan, and Sweeney (1995). The relationship between these measurements is analyzed using a model of simultaneous equations and by the random effects regression method with panel data. A significant negative relationship was expected a priori; however, the main result of the study indicates that voluntary disclosure and earnings management are not simultaneously determined or associated. Although the results obtained contradict certain theoretical assumptions, there are alternative explanations for this finding. The empirical set of evidence in this research, in addition to those in previous studies, should be interpreted with caution because there is no consensus on the measures for voluntary disclosure and earnings management. Second, several companies in Brazil may not be interested in providing high-quality voluntary disclosure because most of their shareholders enjoy private benefits of control.

However, this combination is not necessarily efficient given the unclear relationship between the two strategies. Therefore, crucially, this article investigates the strategic relationship between inventory sharing and demand learning, that is, when and whether they are substitutes or complements. We develop a theoretical game model consisting of two firms facing uncertain demand, and both of them need to determine their production quantity before demand is realized. Contrary to the intuition that demand learning is a substitute for inventory sharing, we find that these two strategies can be complements when the production cost is relatively low or high. Moreover, when forecast accuracy is relatively low, the substitutability will be weakened while the complementarity will be enhanced as forecast accuracy increases. Additionally, the substitutability first weakly decreases and then weakly increases, while the complementarity first weakly increases and then weakly decreases with the transfer price.",Crossref,98.96907216494846,10.1111/deci.12611,https://doi.org/10.1111/deci.12611,Decision Sciences,"Wei, L., Wei, W., Liu, Y., & Zhang, J.

We first examine these strategies and then characterize the equilibrium outcomes. Surprisingly, we reveal that the genuine brand company does not necessarily benefit from heavier penalty and the counterfeiter is not necessarily worse off with more costly counterfeit hiding efforts. Interestingly, the counterfeiter’s hiding effort decreases with heavier penalty when the genuine brand company’s anti-counterfeit and the counterfeiter’s hiding decisions are sufficiently efficient. Besides, higher levels of counterfeit imitation or penetration can either hurt or benefit the genuine brand company. Whether the counterfeiter is better off with deeper counterfeit penetration depends on the status quo. Furthermore, the counterfeiter exerts fewer counterfeit hiding efforts when the genuine brand company exerts more anti-counterfeit efforts, while the anti-counterfeit effort increases with the counterfeit hiding effort, regardless of the anti-counterfeiting strategies.

In this study, we investigate a big retailer’s incentive to block manufacturer SPIFF programs, which has the consequence of demotivating salespeople from advising customers, from the perspective of vertical channel interactions. We scrutinize a big retailer’s decision to maximize its profit through managing its channel interactions with upstream manufacturers offering horizontally differentiated products, customers uncertain about true fits with competing products, and its salesperson who can match customers with suitable products through offering purchase advice. Our analysis shows that motivating the salesperson to advise customers is profitable for the retailer only if the such advising has moderate effectiveness in matching consumers and suitable products, and only in this case would the retailer collaborate on manufacturer SPIFF programs. Otherwise, salesperson advising hurts retailer profit and the big retailer benefits from blocking manufacturer SPIFF programs.

Abstract
This study examines racial and ethnic disparities in mortgage-lending outcomes across different lender types—large banks, fintech lenders, non-bank lenders, small banks, and credit unions—using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data from 2018 to 2023. By analyzing approval rates, rate spreads, and origination charges, we evaluate how borrower outcomes vary by race and ethnicity, controlling for loan characteristics, borrower attributes, and regional factors. Our findings reveal that Black and Hispanic borrowers consistently face less favorable terms than White borrowers, with disparities differing by lender type. Large banks, operating under stringent regulatory oversight, demonstrate relatively equitable pricing but impose higher loan denial rates on minorities. Credit unions, despite offering the lowest rate spreads overall, penalize minority borrowers more severely in pricing than other lender types. Fintech lenders, while charging higher-rate spreads and fees, show smaller credit access disparities for minority borrowers. Non-bank and small banks display mixed results, with inconsistencies in their treatment of minorities across pricing and credit access. These results highlight that neither technological innovations nor alternative lending models alone suffice to eliminate systemic inequities. Achieving equitable mortgage lending requires enhanced regulatory oversight, greater transparency in algorithmic decision-making, and stricter enforcement of fair lending practices.",Semantic Scholar,96.4383561643836,10.1056/NEJMoa2002032,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1890582b5e45df812d4bffac848ffda98a495e1,New England Journal of Medicine,"Liu, Z., & Liang, H.

Univariate, multivariable, machine learning, and regime-switching time series modeling are employed in this research. Findings The authors decompose UR into two components – temporary and permanent UR. The authors find the spike in UR during COVID-19 is mainly attributed to the surge in temporary layoffs. More importantly, the authors find that the credit card charge-off rate is primarily driven by permanent UR while temporary UR has little predictive power. During recessions, permanent UR seems to be a stronger indicator than total UR. This research highlights the importance of using permanent UR for credit risk modeling.

In addition, the authors find the negative relationship between divergent opinions and excess earnings announcement returns in ADRs is more pronounced in countries with short-sales restrictions, while other home-market country-level factors – the enforcement of insider trading law, legal origin, investor protection and rating on accounting standard – do not influence the relationship between investors' divergency of opinion and stock returns.

Methodology – A sample of European banks (27 member countries of the European Union plus U.K.) over the period of 2005 to 2019 are used in this study. Liquidity risk is measured by the ratio of liquid assets to total assets. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors use panel regression with bank fixed effects to control for unobserved characteristics that might affect the dependent variable. Findings – The authors find that banks holding more liquid assets take less risk and show a higher subsequent loan growth rate. These results hold for both small and large banks. Novelty – To the authors’ best knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies to carefully examine the effects of liquidity risk on risk-taking behavior and loan growth rate for European banks. Our research suggests that the current Basel III requirement on liquidity ratio can decrease bank’s risking-taking behavior while not necessarily impact their future loan growth.

47f7fd4c2afea787c931ffa29d3c0c1439f4d018,Finding creativity by changing perspectives: How the evaluation process contributes to creative idea recognition,"Loewenstein, Jeffrey",2023,"ABSTRACT Why do people often fail to find new ideas creative? The literature indicates people fail to find creativity due to ideas having characteristics that are incongruent with people’s existing perspectives. The current paper identifies a second reason stemming from the need for evaluators to understand what ideas are before determining if those ideas meet evaluation criteria. We propose that to find creativity in early phase ambiguous ideas, people’s existing perspectives may not be helpful. People may need to engage in a process of perspective change by searching for and finding alternative fruitful interpretations. Three studies provide evidence that people tended to evaluate ideas as more creative if they spontaneously experienced (Study 1) or were induced to experience (Study 2) a change in perspective when evaluating them. Further, if people were induced not to experience a perspective change, ideas were perceived as less creative (Study 3). These findings add to theory by revealing new aspects of the process of evaluating early phase ideas. They also support practice by identifying why spending more time searching for and potentially finding fruitful interpretations of early phase ideas might help evaluators find creativity, and thereby support rather than squelch innovation. Plain Language Summary The current research identifies a gap in the prior creativity literature on evaluation, which has focused primarily on how people evaluate later phase ideas. We observe that, unlike later phase ideas, early phase ideas may lead evaluators to undertake an additional, initial stage in the idea evaluation process. Early phase ideas are often ambiguous, abstract, and difficult to communicate, which can mean evaluators might need to interpret these ideas in new ways before rendering judgments. As a result, people may experience variation in the process of evaluating early phase ideas. We show that this variation helps explain creativity assessments. During later phase idea evaluation, the creativity literature notes that evaluators use their existing perspectives to determine if ideas are useful via convergent thinking. In contrast, during early phase idea evaluation when ideas are ambiguous, evaluators’ existing perspectives may not help them make sense of ideas, resulting in their viewing these ideas as bizarre and so not creative. It is also possible for evaluators to assimilate ideas into existing perspectives, thereby viewing these ideas as trivial and so not creative. Further still, evaluators may engage in a process of perspective change by searching for (i.e., divergent thinking) and finding (i.e., convergent thinking) a fruitful new perspective with which to appreciate ideas, thereby finding creativity. Our findings suggest that recognizing early phase new ideas as creative can involve a similar kind of thinking as generating creative ideas, namely a perspective change process of seeking out and finding alternative perspectives. Therefore, the evaluation of early phase creative ideas, much like the generation of creative ideas, can be a cognitively effortful activity. An additional implication is that the process people enact during idea evaluation, separate from any characteristics of the ideas themselves, influences how creative those ideas appear to be. Taken together, the results from the current study advance our understanding of why recognizing creative ideas can be hard, what might help, and why thinking about creativity as a process of changing perspectives can be useful.",Semantic Scholar ,91.96428571428571,10.1080/10400419.2023.2191900,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f04375bbc921af4c955c0d946dc24050d2e6510d,Academy of Management Proceedings,"Yang, S., Loewenstein, J., & Mueller, J.

Furthermore, because stories, pictures, and music can generate surprises and those can be widely shared, surprise can have broad social influence. People also tend to share surprising items with others, as anyone on social media has discovered. This means that in addition to broadcasting surprising information, surprising items can also spread through networks.

Evidence demonstrates their positive impact on health outcomes, particularly for Ugandans who would otherwise lack access to health services. Despite their impact, VHTs are not optimally supported and attrition is a growing problem. In this study, we examined the support needs and existing challenges of VHTs in two Ugandan districts and evaluated specific factors associated with long-term retention. We report on findings from a standardized survey of VHTs and exploratory interviews with key stakeholders and draw conclusions that inform efforts to strengthen and sustain community health care delivery in Uganda.MethodsA mixed-methods approach was employed through a survey of 134 individual VHT members and semi-structured interviews with six key stakeholders. Descriptive and bivariate regression analysis of quantitative survey data was performed along with thematic analysis of qualitative data from surveys and interviews. In the regression analysis, the dependent variable is 10-year anticipated longevity among VHTs, which asked respondents if they anticipate continuing to volunteer as VHTs for at least 10 more years if their current situation remains unchanged.ResultsVHTs desire additional support primarily in the forms of money (e.g. transportation allowance) and material supplies (e.g. rubber boots). VHTs commonly report difficult working conditions and describe a lack of respect from their communities and other health workers.

Key components of these systems include emergent, issue-specific communication channels, reconfigured roles, and interactive control practices.

Geoffrey",2017,"Corporations engage in ongoing exchange relationships with many different stakeholder groups, and they frequently fail to meet these constituencies’ concrete and firm-specific expectations (regarding profits, products, etc.). While these events bear an intuitive connection to corporate reputation, several scholars have raised questions about the role of discrete exchanges in overall evaluations of firms. Additionally, scholars have neither systematically examined such effects nor elaborated a formal theory thereof. The present paper fills this gap by developing and testing a middle range theory of this important yet poorly understood relationship. This theory identifies the psychological mechanism (trait attribution) which underlies this relationship and explains how discrete, stakeholder-specific exchange failures can damage reputations of larger corporate entities. It also explains how social and historical information associated with failed exchanges can affect this process. We elaborate and test this theory through a study of the effects of quarterly earnings misses on firms’ standing in the Fortune “Most Admired Company” survey. Consistent with our theory, earnings misses did damage firm standing. However, misses did not invariably produce reputational damage and, as predicted, their effects were contingent on associated social (e.g., peer firm reliability, institutional context) and historical (e.g., the firm’s track record and statements) information.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.46341463414635,,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2010.0968,"EG Love, MS Kraatz - Academy of Management Journal, 2017 - journals.aom.org","Love, E., & Kraatz, M.

These penalties should deter questionable behavior and enable reputation to serve a social control function, yet we know little about how and when these penalties are actually imposed. Unlike prior research in this vein, we account for the fact that reputational penalties associated with such practices may differ across audiences because of differences in interpretations of the practice and differences in causal attributions about its use. Specifically, we develop theory to explain how and when stock analysts and peer executives applied reputational penalties to managers when firms used a poison pill, a prominent anti-takeover device. We find that the reputational penalties associated with poison pills differed substantially between these two groups and that these groups applied different penalties depending on the media coverage that the poison pill received, the performance of the firm, and the extent to which the practice had already been adopted.

Yet evidence consistently demonstrates that compliance-based ethics training focused on teaching regulations and “rules” fails to create ethical cultures. Research and practice in behavioral ethics have demonstrated that there is value in moving away from rule-based, normative, ethics education toward approaches rooted in descriptive explainations about how and why individuals make unethical decisions, and focused on environmental and cultural influences. We examine the circumstances—and subsequent assumptions—that lead to compliance-based RCR training, unpack those assumptions, and identify their outcomes. The question at the heart of compliance-based training is “What must we teach people so they will make ethical decisions?” The command-and-control nature of this question fails to encompass needed elements for broader research integrity, namely, developing ethical habits and building skills for ethical decision-making. Asking instead “How do we develop people to articulate and act in alignment with ethical values?” helps to shift toward more effective and sustainable ethics education.

To understand how medium influences power expression, this paper aims to compare value claiming by asymmetrically powerful negotiators, using face-to-face and computer-mediated messaging across two studies. Following up on long-standing conjectures from prominent coalition researchers, the authors also directly tested the role of the apex negotiator's personality in coalition formation and value expropriation. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted two laboratory experiments which manipulated communication medium (computer-mediated vs face-to-face) in three- and four-person bargaining. They also varied asymmetry of power so the apex negotiator either could not be left out of a winning coalition (Study 1) or could be (Study 2). The authors measured trait assertiveness along with multiple indicators of hard bargaining behavior. Findings Communicating using instant messages via a computer interface facilitated value claiming for powerful negotiators across both studies. Trait assertiveness correlated with hard bargaining behavior in both studies. An index of hard bargaining behavior mediated the effect of assertiveness on value expropriation but only in the context where the powerful negotiator held a genuine monopoly over coalitions. Originality/value The authors contribute to the literature on multiparty negotiations by demonstrating persistent media effects on power utilization and by finally confirming the conjectures of prominent coalition researchers regarding personality. Though personality traits generate consistent effects on behavior, their influence on negotiation outcomes depends on the power structure.

3e8631578643be01cbbc5c1c65c669aef1e183bf,Why We Need a Theory of Stakeholder Governance --- And Why This is a Hard Problem,"Mahoney, Joseph",2020,"Corporate governance is an important topic for both scholars and practicing managers. To date, most work on this subject has focused on how to resolve potential conflicts of interest between a firm’s senior managers and its shareholders in how firms create and distribute economic value. This work, based in agency theory (Alchian&Demsetz,1972; Jensen&Meckling,1976),has led to the design of a variety of corporate governance mechanisms that have been widely implemented by many firmsaroundtheworld (Aguilera& Jackson,2003; Williamson, 1996). These mechanisms include incentive programs for senior managers—such as CEO compensation in the form of stock and stock options based on firm performance—that act as management “bonding” devices (Jensen & Murphy, 1990), and a variety of disciplinary mechanisms—such as the inclusion of “outsiders”onboardsof directors and legallymandated reporting requirements—that increase the ability of shareholders to “monitor” the performance of a firm (Fama & Jensen, 1983). Work on using governance to resolve possible conflicts between senior managers and shareholders has largely developed separately from governance questions focused on the broader relationships between a firm and its multiple stakeholders (Donaldson & Preston,1995;Freeman,1984).This is ironic sincesome of the earliest work on agency theory conceptualized a firm as “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals” (Jensen & Meckling, 1976: 310). These individuals, including “individuals” as legal fictions, can be viewed as a firm’s stakeholders. However, instead of examining how governance could enable a firm to work with all of its stakeholders in creating and distributing economic value, agency theorists have mostly focused on governing the relationship between managers and only a single stakeholder: shareholders. An ideawhose timehas come is that of considering more directly the governance of relations between a firm and its multiple stakeholders and not just with its shareholders. This will necessitate broadening the conceptualization of the value created by a firm beyond simply shareholder return (Barney, 2018; McGahan, 2020), a requirement accentuated by the recent COVID-19 public health crisis (Carney, 2020). However, on the face of it, the analysis of stakeholder governance seems likely to be a more difficult problem than the governance of manager– shareholder relations. Theories of shareholder governance focus on how economic value is created by and distributed between two groups—shareholders and senior managers—that are relatively homogenous with respect to their (sometimes)-conflicting interests regarding how they would like to see a firm managed (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Governance mechanisms designed to reconcile these potential conflicts are relatively straightforward to formulate, although not always easy to implement (Baysinger & Butler, 1985; Tihanyi, Graffin, & George, 2014). Stakeholder governance, however, must deal with much broader relationships between a firm and its multiple stakeholder groups (Freeman, 1984) and the associated creation and distribution of value across them. Conventional corporate finance suggests that, with perfect factor markets, a firm that maximizes the wealth of its shareholders as its sole residual claimants will correspondingly maximize the economic value of the firm (Jensen, 2001).However, this isnot the case in a world of incomplete contracting and strategic factor markets: maximizing shareholder wealth does not necessarily address the conflicting economic interests of shareholders, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders, and thus does not necessarily maximize the value of the firm (Barney, 1986, 2018; Klein, Mahoney, McGahan, & Pitelis, 2012; Zingales, 2000). Moreover, while shareholder governance has primarily focused on economic returns, stakeholders can have interests that go well beyond narrow economic concerns (Campbell, Coff, & Kryscynski, 2012; Carney, 2020; McGahan, 2020). Employees, for example, are likely to be concerned about appropriating some of the economic profits their human capital helps to create (Morris, Alvarez, Barney, &Molloy, 2017), butmay also have interests in personal health (Michel, 2011), work life quality (Lambert, 2000), internal and external pay",Semantic Scholar ,85.49618320610688,10.5465/amr.2020.0181,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a26e133b459ece497e56a24adad4867edb576af9,Academy of Management Review,"Amis, J., Barney, J., Mahoney, J., & Wang, H.

Even though TCE is a broadly applicable theory of governance, one of its specific topics of interest—the make‐or‐buy decision—readily aligns with some of the central research questions on how firms manage supply chains. However, both general management and operations management researchers sometimes misunderstand and misapply TCE's aims, assumptions, and logic. A common mistake is to read TCE as a theory of competence or of power. While TCE relates to both, TCE is essentially a theory of efficient governance of transactions in particular and exchange relationships in general. Our purpose in this study is to review the intellectual and theoretical foundations of TCE, its primary aims, and its applicability as a theory of supply chain efficiency. To this end, we discover much common ground between TCE and research in operations and supply chain management.

However, deriving benefits from these implementations has proved to be a challenge, and a great deal of variation has been observed in the extent of value generated for client and vendor firms. This research examines the role of co-specialization as a strategy to make the most out of outsourced enterprise systems. The authors develop hypotheses relating resource co-specialization with two indicators of success for implementation of enterprise software: (1) exchange success and (2) firm growth.
The hypotheses are tested using a unique panel data set of 175 firms adopting Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) software, a type of enterprise system used for managing manufacturing and logistics. The authors identify organizational factors that support co-specialization and then examine how co-specialization is associated with enterprise software implementation success, controlling for the endogenous choice to co-specialize.
The empirical results suggest that resource co-specialization is positively associated with implementation success and that the two resource co-specialization pathways that are examined complement each other in providing performance benefits.

Despite notable advances, the field still lacks theoretical and empirical frameworks for fully understanding how public and nonprofit organizations interact with private firms to create and appropriate value. By recognizing the inherent complexity of interactions between organizations with different purposes and the existing challenges for designing effective governance arrangements, we assess how recent scholarship addresses some dilemmas related to both private and public value creation. Based on the extant literature and on some novel aspects raised by the articles in this issue, we also propose a framework to advance strategy research in the field. We emphasize the importance of stakeholder management capabilities among public, private, and nonprofit organizations in pursuit of enhanced public value and continuous support from appreciative stakeholders. Managerial Summary Despite abundant examples of governance arrangements involving public, private, and nonprofit organizations (e.g., public‐private partnerships and alliances involving NGOs, firms, multilateral organizations, public contracting, and so on), the strategic management field has only recently given attention to value creation and value appropriation beyond the scope of private organizations. Here we connect strategic management and public management to identify relevant dimensions that shape value‐creating strategies and underpinning outcomes in public‐private‐nonprofit interactions.

Empirical analysis based on firms in the U.S. wireless communications service industry from 1983 to 1998 reveals that post‐entry growth increases with directors’ post‐entry firm‐specific board experience, but decreases with directors’ inherited pre‐entry firm‐specific board experience. In addition, outside directors’ intra‐industry managerial experience stimulates post‐entry growth while intra‐industry directorial experience reduces it. We also find that firms benefit from having true industry outsiders who are experienced in other—not the focal—industries. Taking this evidence together, boards with a mix of directors with post‐entry firm‐specific board expertise and complementary other industry expertise are most suitable for the governance of post‐entry venture growth. Managerial summary C areful board composition design can facilitate post‐entry performance of new entrants into an emerging industry. Specifically, entrants should retain some of the initial recruits to the board in order to steadily build firm‐specific board expertise. They should also introduce genuine industry outsiders (with no experience in the focal industry) to the board in order to inject fresh thinking into board governance, which is critical for renewal of the firm's growth strategy and market positioning over time. For diversifying entrants, if the new market entry is a strategic investment for the parent firm, it is worth setting up a separate board of directors where directors are not linked with the parent firm board, as a preexisting board is likely to be too deeply engaged with existing businesses.

Aim: This study aimed to define the severity of a bleeding event and verify its impact on death risk and the time to endoscopy. Methods: We analyzed 12 factors (demographic, hemodynamic, biochemical, and clinical) that could be associated with BleSev. We identified the independent weight of each factor in predicting a composite endpoint (need for surgery, interventional radiology, and death) and the effect of the interactions between time to endoscopy and BleSev on death risk. Results: Clinical data of 2.525 patients were included. Of the 12 factors, 5 were retained in the final model as follows: altered mental status, systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, blood urea nitrogen level ≥ 130 mg/dL, hematemesis, and hemoglobin level ≤ 8 g/dL (AUC performance curve, 0.79). We identified the following three classes of BleSev: low (0–1 points, 2.4%), intermediate (3–4 points, 8.6%), and high (≥5 points, 21.1%). When no factors were present, the death risk was 1%; when all factors were present, the risk was 45.5%. Notably, the death risk increased with BleSev but was generally independent of time to endoscopy. However, in high-risk cases, early endoscopy (within 6–12 h) was associated with a reduced mortality rate. Conclusions: This study defines a risk model for BleSev and highlights the need for targeted endoscopic timing strategies based on BleSev for optimizing survival rates.

This paper analyzes the economic impact of combining two mechanisms (monetary payments to participants and effort exerted during a clinical study) observed in practice to improve retention. Methodology/results: Given an incentive scheme, under full information and information asymmetry regarding participants’ characteristics, we model the problem of identifying optimal payment and effort to improve retention for a clinical study using a nonlinear integer program. We propose polynomial-time algorithms to solve the problem under full information for a participant-specific linear payment scheme and two commonly observed incentive schemes: Fixed Payment (FP) and Logistics Reimbursement (RE). We also provide exact methods to solve the problem under information asymmetry for the FP and RE schemes. We conduct a comprehensive computational study to gain insights into the relative performance of these schemes. Under full information, the participant-specific scheme can reduce the retention cost by about 46%, on average, compared with that under the RE and FP schemes. Information asymmetry causes the RE scheme to be more favorable than the FP scheme in a wider variety of clinical studies. Further, the value of acquiring participants’ characteristics information is significant under the FP scheme compared with that under the RE scheme. Managerial implications: The determination of monetary payments is ad hoc in practice. Further, an economic analysis of the two mechanisms for improving retention in clinical studies is absent. Given the participants and the clinical study characteristics under full information and information asymmetry, our analysis enables a decision maker to identify an optimum incentive scheme, monetary payment, and effort level for improving retention. Further, our analysis allows a clinical study decision maker to assess budget requirements to improve retention and adapt the incentive payments to Institutional Review Board guidelines, if any.

Episodes are combinations of pre‐acute, acute, and post‐acute services for particular medical conditions. During the year, CMS pays hospitals according to historical norms. At the end of the year, these payments are reconciled against a target price, resulting in either a gain or a loss for the hospital. The hospital may also realize gains or losses from its internal operations. It may incentivize physicians to select certain treatment levels that improve quality and reduce costs by offering to share gains and losses. CMS has placed restrictions on what gains or losses may be shared and implemented stop‐loss and stop‐gain (SLSG) provisions for the hospital and the physicians. In this study, we consider a class of affine gainsharing functions that calculate a physician’s per‐episode share based on both the aggregate performance across all physicians, and the cost and quality outcomes achieved by that physician. We show that when there are no sharing restrictions and no SLSG provisions, an optimal gainsharing function lies in the class of affine functions. In contrast, when there are SLSG constraints, the contract design problem is analytically challenging. Therefore, we perform a series of numerical experiments, which reveal that the hospital SLSG provisions, the maximum savings potential, and the hospital’s risk preferences determine the amount of gains and losses that the hospitals share and the resulting treatment levels.

In this study, we analyze an incentive design problem faced by a budget‐constrained humanitarian organization managing a health care service program (e.g., maternal health or HIV services) with different emphasis on the two measures of quality—structural and process. Incentives offered to the health care provider (referred to as supply‐side incentives) are aimed at improving the availability of good quality services and demand‐side incentives are used to encourage patients to seek care. In many developing country health programs, incentive schemes tend to be purely supply‐side focused or purely demand‐side focused. However, our results suggest that by offering the right combination of incentives to the patients and the provider, program performance can be increased up to 20 times, on average, depending on the service offered. Even within the current practice of using one‐sided incentives, there is significant scope for improvement (as much as 14 times, on average) by ensuring that there is better alignment between the incentive scheme and the service offered.

The current work demonstrates that creative activities are one way for marketers to meet this challenge. Field and lab studies find that engaging potential donors in creative activities positively influences their donation behaviors (i.e., the likelihood of donation and the monetary amount donated). Importantly, the observed effects are shown to be context independent: they hold even when potential donors engage in creative activities unrelated to the focal cause of the charity (or the charitable organization itself). The findings suggest that engaging in a creative activity enhances the felt autonomy of the participant, thus inducing a positive affective state, which in turn leads to higher donation behaviors. Positive affect is demonstrated to enhance donation behaviors due to perceptions of donation impact and a desire for mood maintenance. However, the identified effects emerge only when one engages in a creative activity—not when the activity is noncreative, or when only the concept of creativity itself is made salient.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/00222429211037587,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222429211037587,Journal of Marketing,"Xu, L., Mehta, R., & Dahl, D.

Despite the widespread use of carboplatin/paclitaxel (C/P) in concurrence with radiotherapy for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who are ineligible to receive cisplatin, there is a lack of prospective or comparative analyses examining C/P vs cisplatin.


Objective
To examine the clinical outcomes of patients with SCCHN receiving C/P vs cisplatin in concurrence with radiotherapy in the definitive and postoperative setting.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This retrospective, single-center comparative effectiveness study included patients with SCCHN who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with C/P or cisplatin from January 2010 to March 2021. Patients with human papillomavirus-related and unrelated disease were included. Data analysis was conducted in March 2022.


Exposures
Patients received C/P or cisplatin. Most cisplatin patients received weekly cisplatin or C/P. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy was primarily used, with a median (range) total dose of 70 (66-70) Gy.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Key efficacy end points were locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.


Results
A total of 308 patients were included (66 female individuals [21.4%]; 60 African American individuals [19.5%], 9 Asian individuals [2.9%], 3 Hispanic individuals [1.0%], and 235 White individuals [76.3%]; median [range] age, 63 [24-89] years). Of these patients, 116 (37.7%) had never smoked, 117 (38.0%) formerly smoked, and 75 (24.4%) were active smokers. Primary sites were oropharynx (164 [53.2%]; 164 [84.7%] were human papillomavirus-positive), oral cavity (57 [18.5%]), and larynx (52 [16.9%]); a comparison of illness stage was T3/T4 (191 [62.0%]) vs T1/T2 (117 [38.0%]) and N1 to N3 (258 [83.8%]) vs N0 (50 [16.2%]). A total of 97 patients (31.5%) underwent surgery before concurrent therapy. No meaningful differences between cisplatin and C/P were observed for 3-year rates of LRFS (97.0% vs 96.2%; difference, -0.8%; 95% CI, -5.2% to 3.6%), PFS (77.5% vs 79.8%; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -7.4% to 12.0%), DMFS (83.4% vs 86.8%; difference, 3.4%; 95% CI, -5.3% to 12.1%), or OS (90.8% vs 92.9%; difference, 2.1%; 95% CI, -4.5% to 8.7%). C/P was associated with a higher rate of grade 3 to 4 leukopenia, anemia, and dermatitis and more feeding tube placements and hospitalizations.


Conclusions and Relevance
The results of this study suggest that there were no differences in LRFS, PFS, DMFS, and OS in patients with SCCHN receiving radiotherapy with C/P vs cisplatin. These results support the use of C/P as an alternative regimen in patients who cannot receive cisplatin.",Semantic Scholar,100.0,10.1001/jamaoto.2025.1706,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f907d3cda2d1f20e3b6cb196a9c1d2db40251164,JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,"Herd, K., & Mehta, R.

We find that less-capitalized banks reduce loan retention, particularly among loans with higher capital requirements and at times when capital is scarce, and nonbanks step in.

We empirically investigate these incentives using a novel dataset that includes the frequency with which banks monitor borrowers' financial condition and the collateral underlying syndicated bank loans.

Monitoring frequency is increasing in the lead arranger's loan share for private borrowers and the lead bank's reputation for public borrowers. These results are consistent with lender reputation mitigating moral hazard only to the extent that monitoring effort is verifiable. Lead banks also monitor more when monitoring is likely to produce new information and when information is more valuable, such as when borrower financial health deteriorates.

However, investors who are less likely to scrutinize non-GAAP reporting rely on the cue provided by the label when deciding whether to seek out the non-GAAP reconciliation, and are more likely to be misled by inappropriately used labels.

Results of multiple experiments indicate that the majority of individuals do use a high probability threshold to determine asset existence whereas, for liabilities, the majority use a very low threshold. Thus, even under ceteris paribus conditions, liabilities are more frequently identified than assets — a phenomenon consistent with conservatism on the balance sheet. We also provide evidence showing that standard setters’ definitions are not the cause of this behavior, as individuals naturally use probability when making these existence decisions. Our findings also indicate that a simple definitional change, as proposed by the IASB in its recent Exposure Draft (2015a), leads more individuals to identify assets and liabilities in a manner that is more closely (but not perfectly) aligned with standard setters’ goals.

Werner found that investors reacted positively to the accidental disclosure of covert ties to the Republican Governors Association. In contrast, when we apply the same research design to the ALEC leak, we find that, on average, firms tied to ALEC experienced negative abnormal returns. In cross‐sectional models, we also find that the abnormal returns of ALEC sponsors were more negative for firms that faced shareholder contention around CPA and had liberal‐leaning employees, yet less negative for firms engaged in higher levels of institutional corporate social responsibility. The latter two cross‐sectional findings extend Werner's results. Managerial Summary We replicate and extend a study that examined how investors reacted to the disclosure of firms' covert contributions to a conservative‐leaning nonprofit organization. In contrast to that paper, we find that investors react negatively toward firms that contributed to ALEC, given its controversial positions on sociopolitical issues such as “stand your ground” gun laws.

The answer is theoretically ambiguous: while urban areas have traditionally been associated with heightened exposure to environmental pollutants, the economies of scale and density inherent to urban environments offer unique opportunities for mitigating or adapting to these harmful exposures. To make progress on this question, we focus on the United States and consider how exposures – to air pollution, drinking water pollution, and extreme temperatures – and the response to those exposures differ across urban and rural settings. While prior studies have addressed some aspects of these issues, substantial gaps in knowledge remain, in large part due to historical deficiencies in monitoring and reporting, especially in rural areas. As a step toward closing these gaps, we present new evidence on urban–rural differences in air quality and population sensitivity to air pollution, leveraging recent advances in remote sensing measurement and machine learning. We find that the urban–rural gap in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has converged over the last two decades and the remaining gap is small relative to the overall declines. Furthermore, we find that residents of urban counties are, on average, less vulnerable to the mortality effects of PM2.5 exposure.

The study uses a longitudinal data set spanning over 44 months and tracks over 13,000 of a firm’s customers, totaling over 200,000 transactions from a parking services provider. Findings Results show that absolute price thresholds affect purchasing decisions. Customers are willing to pay a range of prices for a considered purchase, and when a price is within customers’ acceptable price range, it does not induce a change in their purchase behavior. However, specific identifiable customer attributes influence the propensity to continue buying and influence the acceptable price range.

A total of 403 people participated in the studies. Findings Results showed that these consumers consider targeted promotions unfair, and the primary reason is centered more on damage to relational identity than the economics of reduced perceived value. The effect is moderated by how the targeted promotion is delivered (buyer-discovered vs seller-delivered) and different basis for selection. Practical implications As companies adopting the practice of dynamic pricing such as targeted promotion, it is important to manage relationship with their consumers. Framing targeted promotions that reduce the salience of seller’s role and provide explanations that not attributed to buyer-seller relationship are important in reducing the potential damage of targeted promotion on relational identity.

We study these phenomena in the context of product recalls in pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Based on text analysis of recall documents, recalls are divided into process related and design related to represent slip-up failures and knowledge gap failures. We further study how innovation capabilities, represented by accumulated stocks of patents and lagged research and development (R&D) intensity, impact learning from both types of failures. We test our hypotheses using negative binomial generalized linear models to analyze longitudinal data for 108 publicly traded U.S. firms over 2000–2016 comprising 7,984 recalls. Results indicate that design-related recalls generate learning to a greater extent than process-related recalls, and that accumulated patents and lagged R&D intensity enhance learning from design-related recalls. These findings suggest that the learning mechanisms invoked by failures are concentrated more on knowledge gap failures than slip-up failures, and such learning is impacted by innovation capabilities. Overall, this research extends organizational learning theory by differentiating between learning from different types of failures and extends absorptive capacity theory by incorporating the role of innovation capabilities in enhancing learning from failures. We develop recommendations for learning from slip-up failures by focusing on the cultural and social mechanisms of organizational learning in addition to the technical and structural mechanisms that may mainly impact learning from knowledge gap failures.

In practice, however, many routing scenarios are not fully codifiable, and human routing agents will likely exhibit biases in their routing decisions. In this paper, we explore the presence of behavioral inertia in service center routing. Inertia in this context is the propensity for routing agents to route issues more frequently to other agents with whom they have experience, rather than optimally routing those issues. We leveraged a unique dataset of more than 70,000 routing decisions in a complex service operations context to examine the presence of inertia and associated performance implications. We find that, overall, inertia hurts performance, but in certain situations can be beneficial. Inertia increases the probability of issue resolution when agents exhibit inertial behavior in routing to other agents with high expertise, and inertia positively impacts (decreases) service time for particularly difficult, complex customer issues.

We elucidate the sociodemographic sources of variation in encounter usage and the impact of encounter usage on glucose control, which can be used to recommend encounter usage for different sociodemographic strata of patients to reduce risks from Type 2 diabetes. Data and methods We analyzed data from a multi-facility clinic in the Midwestern United States on 2124 patients with type 2 diabetes, from 95 ZIP codes. A zero-inflated Poisson model was used to estimate the effects of various ZIP-code level sociodemographic variables on the encounter usage. A multinomial logistic regression model was built to estimate the effects of physical and telephonic encounters on patients’ glucose level transitions. Results from the two models were combined in marginal effect analyses. Results and conclusions Conditional on patients’ clinical status, demographics, and insurance status, significant inequality in patient encounters exists across ZIP codes with varying sociodemographic characteristics. One additional physical encounter in a six-month period marginally increases the probability of transition from a diabetic state to a pre-diabetic state by 4.3% and from pre-diabetic to the non-diabetic state by 3.2%. Combined marginal effect analyses illustrate that a ZIP code in the lower quartile of high school graduate percentage among all ZIP codes has 1 fewer physical encounter per six months marginally compared to a ZIP code at the upper quartile, which gives 5.4% average increase in the probability of transitioning from pre-diabetic to diabetic. Our results suggest that policymakers can target particular patient groups who may have inadequate encounters to engage in diabetes care, based on their immediate environmental sociodemographic characteristics, and design programs to increase their encounters to achieve better care outcomes.",Crossref,91.47286821705427,10.1371/journal.pone.0249084,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249084,PLOS ONE,"Ye, H., Mukherjee, U., Chhajed, D., Hirsbrunner, J., & Roloff, C.

Managing Mass‐Gathering Healthcare (MGH), especially in resource‐constrained regions, is a key policy challenge. Planning and preparation for MGH require understanding the sources, and estimation of demand. We propose a spatio‐temporal Poisson point process model for MGH demand estimation that considers the associated risk factors. We analyze admissions data from a multi‐specialty hospital in Ujjain, India, spanning a period before, during, and after Kumbh Mela, one of the larger religious gatherings globally. The results show that the effect of mass‐gathering on hospital admissions is heterogeneous across disease groups. We identify key socio‐economic and healthcare infrastructural factors that are associated with MGH demand. We establish the external‐validity of the results by demonstrating that mass‐gatherings generally increase the spatial dependence across regions, particularly where availability of healthcare infrastructure is relatively low.

Little is known, however, about how firms manage the timing of recalls and how this timing influences the financial consequences of recalls. In this study, we provide evidence for a previously unknown phenomenon: recall clustering, a collection of recalls within close temporal proximity in which a leading recall (the first recall in a cluster) excites following recalls (subsequent recalls in a cluster). We also investigate how the stock market penalizes firms differently depending upon their position within the recall cluster. Academic/practical relevance: By demonstrating that auto firms cluster their recalls and that the market penalizes firms differently based on the position of a recall within a cluster, we contribute to the literature that investigates recall timing and stock market event studies and provide guidance for regulators who oversee auto recalls and managers who make recall decisions. Methodology: We first develop analytical predictions using a dynamic game theoretic model to motivate our hypotheses. We then examine empirical support for our hypotheses by analyzing 3,117 auto recalls across 48 years using a Hawkes process model. Hawkes process models are designed to examine self-excitation of events across time and can be used to investigate recall clustering, while categorizing recalls as leading or following within a cluster. Finally, we use the leading and following recall designations obtained from the Hawkes process model in an event study to examine how the stock market effects of a recall vary depending on its position within a cluster. Results: We find that 73% of recalls occur in clusters, and they form after a 16-day gap in recall announcements. On average, clusters last for 34 days and are comprised of 7.6 following recalls announced after the leading recall. Leading recalls are associated with as high as a 67% larger stock market penalty than following recalls. Further, we find that the stock market benefit realized by a following recall weakens as the time since the leading recall increases and that the stock market penalty faced by a leading recall grows as the time since the end of the last cluster increases. Managerial Implications: Our findings lead to a key implication for regulators who oversee auto recalls by demonstrating evidence of recall clustering and the underlying stock market effects that are attributable to it. We provide a cost-neutral policy recommendation for the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration that should limit recall clustering.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2020.0937,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2020.0937,Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management,"Mukherjee, U., Ball, G., Wowak, K., Natarajan, K., & Miller, J.

We investigate how organizational forgetting affects such quality gains obtained from spillover. We analyze the quality data of 191 suppliers who supply similar products to two distinct businesses: a car and a commercial vehicle manufacturer. A latent class analysis identifies that the spillover of quality knowledge is significant at 93 of the 191 shared suppliers. Spillover is more likely at shared suppliers when there are higher product and process commonality between the components supplied to the different buyers, but less likely when suppliers use multiple facilities to cater to the requirements of the different buyers. Further investigation of the retention of quality knowledge of 93 suppliers with significant spillover reveals that forgetting erodes the quality gains obtained from spillover by 19.09% annually. This effect is larger than the depreciation of quality gains obtained from working directly with suppliers (10.93%). Moreover, the impact of forgetting depends on where the quality knowledge is retained: the quality knowledge embedded in routines erodes faster than the quality knowledge embedded in technology or organizational members. Furthermore, the impact of forgetting on spillover depends on where the quality improvement initiatives are implemented: gains from initiatives in the output activities depreciate less than gains from efforts in the in‐process activities.

It allows surgeons to gain additional dexterity, improved precision in surgical tasks, enhanced three‐dimensional vision of the surgical field, and superior accessibility to the surgical field. Notwithstanding the clinical outcome benefits (such as reduced blood loss and surgical duration, and shorter length‐of‐stay at a hospital), the cost of performing robot‐assisted surgery is significantly high, due to the investments needed for robot acquisition, maintenance, and procurement of surgical accessories. In this study, we address the twin objectives of a hospital where robot‐assisted surgery is performed: maximize the clinical outcome benefits and minimize the total cost of robot‐assisted surgery. The surgical robot that is the focus of the study is a da Vinci surgical system. The surgical procedure that serves as the context of this study is hysterectomy. We demonstrate the application of an integrated methodological approach—combining empirical analysis involving an on‐site, prospective investigation at a hospital and retrospective analysis of archival data from the hospital for robustness checks, analytical modeling, and discrete event simulation—to identify and analyze actionable policies that a hospital can implement. The specific policies we analyze are related to: (a) patient triaging for robot‐assisted surgery based on the criticality of disease condition of a patient; (b) the optimal size of surgeon pool to facilitate the development of surgeon experience and learning; and (c) the minimum experience level of a surgeon with a robot needed to be included in the surgeon pool for robot‐assisted surgery. The key contributions of this article are in demonstrating the following: First, hospital‐level policies can help to realize both the clinical outcome and cost benefits of a surgical robot. Second, the criticality of patient condition is a significant determinant of surgeon learning in robot‐assisted surgery. Third, application of the proposed integrated methodological approach can yield nuanced and actionable insights into an operational setting where data availability is limited and generalizability of study insights is a concern, as is the case in this study.",Crossref,99.1869918699187,10.1002/joom.1058,https://doi.org/10.1002/joom.1058,Journal of Operations Management,"Mukherjee, U.

However, there is little understanding of why firms vary within and across industries in the number of EMPs they adopt (EMP adoption). In this study, we seek to identify the sources of variation and quantify the relative importance of each source. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) and a 12‐year panel data including 880 firms from 258 industries, we show that temporality (variation over time), firm‐specific choices and characteristics, and industry membership account for 40%, 26%, and 34% of the observed variation in EMP adoption, respectively. Additional analysis shows that the explanatory power of each source is contingent on the “ type” of EMP adopted; suggesting that approaches to incent increased adoption should be aligned with EMP type. Finally, we identify which specific firm characteristics and industry attributes impact the observed heterogeneity. As the first study to focus on identifying and estimating sources of variation in EMP adoption, it makes a fundamental contribution to theory and practice by showing how annual increases in adoption can be accelerated by better understanding the levers which influence firm‐level EMP adoption decisions.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.13083,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13083,Production and Operations Management,"Mukherjee, U.

To date, little is known about the workings and sustenance of NPO‐enabled long‐term health care delivery in underserved communities, and even less about NPO‐enabled surgical care delivery. Further, health care delivery in underserved communities is a context that is often characterized by primitive and poor record keeping, data scarcity and poor data quality. Therefore, conducting research on health care delivery in such contexts is particularly challenging. The central question motivating this study is: How can international NPOs enable the long‐term delivery of surgical care in underserved communities? To overcome the data challenges, we use multi‐method triangulation as the research design to conduct this study. Specifically, we adopt a grounded theory approach with small sample statistical analysis for empirical validation. We triangulate insights from qualitative and quantitative data analyses to develop and validate an integrative framework for an international NPO‐enabled long‐term surgical care delivery in underserved communities. The setting for this study is Children's HeartLink, an international medical non‐profit organization based in the United States, which partners with health care delivery organizations in developing countries to enable the diagnosis and treatment of children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The focus of this study is the Children HeartLink's partnership with the First Hospital of Lanzhou University (FHLU) located in the underserved and impoverished Gansu province of China. In Gansu province, the CHD incidence rate is six times China's average. The time‐period of this study is 11 years, 1998–2008. The key contribution of this study is the integrative framework for an international NPO‐enabled long‐term surgical care delivery in underserved communities. The framework demonstrates how an international NPO's efforts related to affordability, provider awareness, and physical access are interdependent, and how the efforts interact and impact the surgical care delivery outcome. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the framework provides new and nuanced insights such as the following: (i) an international NPO's efforts related to affordability (e.g., funding) or provider awareness (e.g., knowledge transfer) alone has limited direct impact on long‐term surgical care outcome; (ii) instead of having a direct impact on the volume of surgeries, an international NPO's effort related to affordability moderates (positively interacts with) the positive association between its efforts related to provider awareness and physical access to surgical care delivery infrastructure, thus impacting the volume of surgeries; and (iii) an international NPO's efforts related to provider awareness and physical access are complementary for long‐term surgical care delivery – i.e., the effort related to provider awareness moderates by way of strengthening the positive association between the effort related to physical access and the volume of surgeries.

Since the present value of the uncertain borrowing fee is reflected in options prices, the difference between option‐implied and realized fees estimates this premium.

Simulation exercises that limit what data are tracked, where and how frequently these data are tracked show a decrease in the predictive performance of models that use geo-tracking data. However, the decrease varies by the type of restriction; regulations that restrict what data are geo-tracked (i.e., summaries of driving behaviors) result in the largest decreases in predictive performance (13.78%), while regulations that restrict where users are geo-tracked (i.e., within a few miles of a business location) and how frequently result in smaller decreases (5.52% and 3.15-3.41%, depending on the frequency). Importantly, models with geo-tracking generally outperform models that do not use any geo-tracking data by reducing the extent of overpredicting and underpredicting visits. These findings can assist managers and policymakers in assessing the risks and benefits associated with the use of geo-tracking data.",Crossref,100.0,10.1007/s11129-025-09299-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11129-025-09299-2,Quantitative Marketing and Economics,"Narang, U., & Luco, F.

The authors leverage a natural experiment involving an exogenous failure in a large omnichannel retailer's app that made the app unavailable. They examine the impact of the app failure on purchases in both online (website, mobile app) and offline (store) channels using a difference-in-differences approach. The findings show a substantial adverse effect of the app failure on shoppers’ frequency, quantity, and monetary value of purchases, leading to short-term revenue losses of up to $1.08 million, with an additional $1.89 million in potential long-term revenue erosion. The effects are heterogeneous across channels and shoppers. The decline in purchases across channels stems from reduced purchases in stores (vs. online). The decline in store purchases is predominantly explained by the search discontinuation mechanism, wherein shoppers who use the app for search but complete their purchases in stores curtail their offline purchases following the app failure. The effect on purchases in the retailer's online channel is insignificant, aligning with the channel-switching mechanism, wherein shoppers who use the app primarily to purchase simply pivot to another online channel. Furthermore, shoppers with a lower monetary value of past purchases and more recent purchases are more sensitive to an app failure than others.",Crossref,91.33858267716535,10.1177/00222437251318660,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437251318660,Journal of Marketing Research,"Narang, U., Shankar, V., & Narayanan, S.

Although prior research has examined the effects of deal-oriented content that primarily offers promotions for a single product on shopper spending, the effects of inspirational content that sparks ideas (e.g., ways to use products) on spending are unclear. Inspirational content can affect spending differently from deal-oriented content as it activates stronger motivation for consumption goal completion. This article proposes that inspirational content activates stronger motivations for the consumer’s goal completion and therefore increases spending more than deal-oriented content does. The authors propose and empirically test the hypotheses using data from a set of experimental studies, a field experiment, and an eye-tracking study. The results show that inspirational content increases spending more than deal-oriented content or no content does. This effect is mediated by consumption goal completion, such that it is attenuated when consumers already have consumption goals or when the content detracts from inspiration-induced goals.

Although their reach is quite large, the impact of these platforms is constrained by a low level of learner engagement. In traditional face-to-face classrooms, educators aim to engage learners by asking them to participate in class discussions and share information about their identity and ideas. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in online learning platforms is uncertain. The authors examine this issue by assessing the impact of two different types of content sharing on learner engagement. The authors conduct a textual analysis of over 12,000 text postings during an 18-month period (Study 1) and a field experiment among over 2,000 learners (Study 2) in a popular Coursera offering by a large U.S. university. The results indicate that asking learners to share ideas (vs. their identity) has a stronger effect on their video consumption and assessment completion. The authors explain this “idea advantage” by suggesting that learners who share ideas (vs. identity) exhibit a greater degree of elaboration.

Our interest is whether this self-directed learning environment produces similar harmful binge behavior as observed with online television, where memory and satisfaction with the experience decrease over time. With access to clickstream data from an online e-educator, we found 62% of the sample binged their learning by concentrating their studies within the semester rather than distributing their online activity throughout. Two types of binge learning emerged as significant: Front-bingers, who accessed the majority of their education early, performed more similarly over time to those who spaced their learning activities. Back-bingers, who accessed the majority of their material late in the semester, did not perform as well.

Isolating and studying the level of arousal – one dimension of affect communicated in the ad, as opposed to valence – we examine the moderating roles of two factors: retention time (i.e., immediate vs. delayed memory) and the fit between ad-arousal and the ad claim. The results of three experiments show that ad-arousal inhibits immediate memory but enhances delayed memory. These effects, however, occur only when the level of arousal communicated in the ad fits the ad claim; whereas when the level of arousal does not fit the claim, ad-arousal does not influence memory. Insights from this research shed light on the boundary conditions of the effect of ad emotional arousal on memory, contributing to the development of an integrative theory on such effects, which can serve as a guide to advertisers in developing effective message strategies in different circumstances.",Semantic Scholar ,98.6842105263158,10.1080/02650487.2020.1822670,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8ac009909a87cb516e2f31f6cc121dcea789637,International Journal of Advertising,"Noel, H., & Riemer, H.

Thus, we define corporate purpose, at both the organizational and societal levels, as an institutionalized ideal, a historical, value-based aspiration guiding strategic decision making and practices. We interpret the current societal movement on corporate purpose as one rejecting the logic of shareholder capitalism and proposing sustainable capitalism in its place: an ideal for corporate purpose based on sustainable prosperity for society and its population. At the organizational level, corporate purpose can thus be articulated as a distinctive and meaningful intent to enhance the lives of people. We identify four strategic issues to consider in reconstituting a corporation’s purpose: corporate governance, strategic leadership, stakeholder engagement, and implementation.

These reflections make evident that McGahan’s actions cannot be appreciated without recognition of the complex dilemmas to which she was responding. These dilemmas include issues of trustworthy leadership, gendered power, leader voice, sensemaking and learning, organizational identities, psychological contracts, institutional leadership, and “good bureaucracy.”",Crossref,91.11111111111111,10.1177/1056492619853365,https://doi.org/10.1177/1056492619853365,Journal of Management Inquiry,"Bartunek, J., Elsbach, K., Bell, E., Markides, C., Christianson, M., Sutcliffe, K., Pratt, M., Coyle-Shapiro, J., Glynn, M., Ocasio, W., & others, .

Using multilevel data from Korean business groups, we propose that the effects of failure to meet an aspiration level on R&D search intensity increase when member firm performance and R&D investments are more cognitively accessible to group-level managers. Specifically, we find, first, that when underperforming firms are widespread in a business group, a focal member firm intensifies R&D search in response to performance below an aspiration level because member firm performance, as a group-level problem, becomes cognitively accessible to group-level managers. Second, as member firms operating in R&D intensive industries are more prevalent in a business group, R&D investments, as a search solution, become more cognitively accessible to group-level managers. Thus, a focal member firm reinforces R&D search in response to the performance shortfall.

The tendency to view communication channels as “pipes and prisms” for information processing has, however, limited its ability to address strategic change. We propose a broader role for communication as a process by which actors can attend to and engage with organizational and environmental issues and initiatives and argue that such a view can significantly advance understanding of strategic change. On this basis, we offer suggestions for future research on communication practices, vocabularies, rhetorical tactics, and talk and text in shaping organizational attention in strategic change. We also maintain that this enhanced view of the ABV can help advance research on dynamic capabilities, strategy processes, strategy‐as‐practice, and behavioral strategy. Managerial Summary : To further enhance our capabilities to manage strategic change and renewal processes in organizations, we need a better understanding of how to manage organizational attention. In this article, we highlight the importance of understanding the role of communication and discuss the use of different communication practices, vocabularies, rhetorical tactics, and talk and text as possible levers that can be used to dynamically shape organizational attention. We call for further research to advance the understanding of how these levers can be used to influence the ways in which different sets of strategic issues, initiatives, and action alternatives are handled.

An attention model of top managers' opportunity beliefs for strategic action,"Ocasio, William",2017,"Research summary: Exploiting opportunities is critical to a firm's competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, there has been considerable interest in the processes by which top managers allocate attention to potential opportunities. Although such investigations have largely focused on top‐down processes for allocating attention to the environment, some studies have explored bottom‐up processes. In this article, we consider both top‐down and bottom‐up processing to develop a model by which top managers form opportunity beliefs for strategic action depending on the allocation of transient and sustained attention. Specifically, this attentional model provides insights into how a top manager's attention is allocated to identify potential opportunities from environmental change and explores how different modes of attentional engagement impact the likelihood of forming beliefs about radical and incremental opportunities requiring strategic action . Managerial summary: Managers are interested in noticing and exploiting opportunities because the exploitation of an opportunity represents an important strategic action. Noticing and exploiting opportunities depends on how and where top managers allocate their attention. Managers can focus attention based on their knowledge and experience or as a result of something in the environment capturing their attention. In this paper, we consider both knowledge‐driven and environment‐driven processes for allocating attention to form opportunity beliefs. This opportunity belief arises from a two stage process. The first stage explains how a top manager identifies environmental changes as potential opportunities. The second stage explains how the top manager forms a belief that these identified environmental changes represent a radical or incremental opportunity worthy of exploitation .

Concretely, we focus on the implications for value creation and capture in terms of organizations’ business models and governance strategies, respectively. We posit that strategic organizational choices are shaped by available institutional logics and theorize that greater institutional pluralism leads to increased heterogeneity—rather than isomorphism—in business models and governance strategies. As the mechanism for heterogeneity, we explain how pluralism leads to differentiated organizational commitments to distinct combinations and prioritizations of institutional logics.

Using 23 years of U.S. patent data (1.8 million patents, 4,769 firms) and a novel text-based recombination measure (SPaRK), the study finds that a higher share of female inventors increases firms’ recombinant innovation intensity, patent output, citations, and innovation efficiency. Moreover, inventor gender diversity enhances the innovation productivity of female inventors. Cross-gender collaboration emerges as the key mechanism for these gains, enabling firms to unlock the “diversity bonus,” especially for recombinant intensity. Interestingly, the diversity bonus is not homogenous and depends on how central females are within the firm’s knowledge network. Greater gender diversity also translates into better financial outcomes for firms, indicating that the innovation gains outweigh the costs of diversity. For managers, the study suggests not only hiring and retaining a gender-diverse inventor workforce, but also facilitating cross-gender collaborative environments to activate recombinant intensity and other innovation gains, especially at firms where female inventors are not central.

The developed measures show an upstream industry might be competitive and contain many suppliers (low industrial concentration) and yet be concentrated in a few countries (high geopolitical concentration) or a small geographical area (high geographical concentration), thus leaving the downstream firm vulnerable to geographical or geopolitical disruptions. Using COVID-19 as an exogenous shock, we document that the firms whose upstream suppliers are operating in industries that have high concentration (either geographically or geopolitically), on average, experienced a reduction of 250 million US dollars in quarterly sales. Thus, competitive industries with ample suppliers may still impose significant risks on downstream firms if the upstream suppliers’ industries are concentrated mainly in a few countries or small geographical areas. Noteworthy, we find evidence that the link between upstream suppliers’ industry-level concentrations and downstream firms’ sales growth is heterogeneous. Specifically, firms can mitigate the negative relationship by adjusting their supply chain networks. The negative relationship is weaker for firms with a geopolitically diversified supply base and firms with more domestic suppliers. Our estimates are robust and consistently identified through several different empirical strategies. Our findings help policymakers and managers to systematically identify locations in supply networks that have the potential to create bottlenecks that may even threaten national security.

Using 23 years of U.S. patent data (1.8 million patents, 4,769 firms) and a novel text-based recombination measure (SPaRK), the study finds that a higher share of female inventors increases firms’ recombinant innovation intensity, patent output, citations, and innovation efficiency. Moreover, inventor gender diversity enhances the innovation productivity of female inventors. Cross-gender collaboration emerges as the key mechanism for these gains, enabling firms to unlock the “diversity bonus,” especially for recombinant intensity. Interestingly, the diversity bonus is not homogenous and depends on how central females are within the firm’s knowledge network. Greater gender diversity also translates into better financial outcomes for firms, indicating that the innovation gains outweigh the costs of diversity. For managers, the study suggests not only hiring and retaining a gender-diverse inventor workforce, but also facilitating cross-gender collaborative environments to activate recombinant intensity and other innovation gains, especially at firms where female inventors are not central.

To do so, we interview 39 audit litigators, who identify factors germane to trial venues, jury pools, and case arguments. Guided by the elaboration likelihood model, we construct a framework that predicts these factors influence litigation outcomes by changing jurors’ motivation and/or capability to elaborate.

Partners point to a variety of both auditor and client factors as threats to audit effectiveness.

By contrast, we predict that prompting auditors in this manner will backfire, making them less (more) heavily weight indicia that misstatements are (not) material. We further predict auditors will apply this asymmetric weighting instrumentally —to a greater degree as needed—to justify management‐preferred conclusions. We test these predictions in two experiments in which in‐charge audit seniors judge the likelihood that identified audit differences are material and choose required adjustment amounts. Between‐participants, we manipulate whether or not auditors are prompted to take an investor's perspective and, within‐participants, whether these audit differences would or would not violate a qualitative criterion—by breaking or not breaking a favorable profitability trend. Study 1 uses a context in which a relatively low degree of motivated perspective taking is needed, as the audit difference is just below tolerable misstatement (TM). Investor‐prompted auditors assess audit differences as less likely to be material than do unprompted auditors, but only when the qualitative criterion is not violated. Study 2 adds a between‐participant manipulation of misstatement tolerability—that is, whether the audit difference is just below or well above TM. Consistent with an instrumental increase in motivated perspective taking, investor‐prompted auditors assess audit differences that simultaneously are less tolerable and violate a qualitative criterion as significantly less likely to be material.

We obtain field data from the US audit insurance industry (16 interviews and 83 survey responses) to examine whether insurers also possess characteristics favorable to transferring their private risk management knowledge to the audit firms they insure. Possessing such characteristics would enable insurers to use their relative knowledge advantage to provide a benefit to audit firms beyond risk shifting. Thus, examining this issue helps broaden our understanding of insurers' role in auditing. We examine our data through the lens of the knowledge transfer theory and find evidence that audit liability insurers have the motivation and capacity to accumulate and transfer risk management knowledge to the audit firms they insure. We find that audit firms, particularly the small resource‐constrained firms (i.e., non–Big 4 and non‐second‐tier), rely on and benefit from their insurers' risk management knowledge. We also find that insurers transfer such knowledge through multiple mechanisms, including free consultative services, policy premium incentives, and continuing professional education classes.

However, numerous studies suggest that auditors fail to evaluate evidence objectively when assessing or addressing the risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We develop theory to predict that auditors do evaluate evidence objectively but only when they have stronger wise‐thinking dispositions (WTDs), a construct that is new to the audit literature. We define WTDs as the tendency of individuals to naturally engage in the balanced revision of beliefs and doubts about target phenomena by thinking openly and reflectively about evidence. We report prediction‐consistent results from two experiments that measure the strength of participants' WTDs and manipulate whether the underlying evidence is less or more indicative of fraud. The experimental results also document that auditors vary considerably in WTD strength and collectively demonstrate the reproducibility of audit judgment‐quality benefits of stronger WTDs. We further validate the WTD construct in auditing using confirmatory bi‐factor analyses to show that it has one higher‐order general factor along with several subfactors. Overall, our theory and results advance the literature by identifying WTDs as a determinant of auditors' ability to objectively evaluate evidence.

While auditors may understand what evidence would address such cues, we propose that auditors fail to apply this understanding because they use implemental mindsets when making decisions for themselves (i.e., deciding). However, we also propose that auditors use deliberative mindsets when advising. To test our predictions, we assign auditors to a decider or an advisor role in a realistic case that contains seeded fraud cues and asks them to consider revising last year’s plan. We also manipulate whether the case prompts auditors to revise the plan unconventionally. Results indicate decider-condition auditors use implemental mindsets: Prompted deciders follow the unconventional plan without regard to underlying fraud risk and unprompted deciders stick with the same-as-last-year (SALY) plan. Advisor-condition auditors use more deliberative mindsets: In the prompt and no prompt conditions, they identify plans that are strongly linked to their own fraud risk assessments and that better align with experts’ recommended plan for effectively addressing the seeded fraud cues. Supplemental analyses suggest deciding and advising auditors both follow experts’ plan when they believe in its potential effectiveness but, after controlling for the influence of perceived effectiveness, deciding auditors follow it to a greater extent simply because they believe the PCAOB wants it. By contrast, advising auditors do not exhibit signs of excessive PCAOB influence. Our findings provide evidence that seeking informal advice (or thinking like an advisor) helps auditors to effectively revise audit plans in response to identified fraud risk – it helps when a prompt is present or not, suggesting it complements rather than merely substitutes for interventions meant to improve auditors’ judgment and decision-making.",Semantic Scholar,95.59748427672956,10.1111/1911-3846.12590,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/884009f725dff3578ce4736cf68456328283f820,,"Bauer, T., Hillison, S., Peecher, M., & Pomeroy, B.

There is, however, little evidence of the factors that drive the settlement norm and its exceptions in audit legal disputes. To better understand these factors, we rely on theory related to how professionals manage risks and, as a result, how professions defend jurisdictional claims. We use this theoretical lens to help motivate four research questions that we probe by interviewing 27 prominent attorneys experienced in audit litigation. Consistent with our lens, our interview data indicate that attorneys manage their risks, including the risk of reputational loss, by settling based on their expectations of trial verdicts. Unlike trials, settlements simultaneously enable attorneys on both sides to limit costs and avoid catastrophic jury verdicts and, by doing so, claim “wins” for their clients. Attorneys also stress that they settle many audit disputes without any legal filings. Thus, a large subset of disputes is invisible to the public and researchers. Attorneys characterize trials as exceptions to the settlement norm that emerge due to abnormal conditions sometimes present in disputes. However, trial verdicts in these abnormal conditions help attorneys justify the use of settlements to clients, as attorneys stress that by settling they can avoid the dreaded possibility of extreme unfavorable verdicts. We conclude that as individual attorneys manage their risks, especially the risk of reputational loss, their profession maintains its public image and thereby defends its jurisdictional claims. Among the many questions we pose for future research is whether the settlement norm reduces society's ability to monitor the audit profession and, more generally, whether this norm's benefits outweigh its drawbacks.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1911-3846.12569,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12569,Contemporary Accounting Research,"Peecher, M.

We randomly assign narratives of fraud and nonfraud companies to auditors as well as the presence versus absence of an instruction explaining that cognitive dissonance in speech is helpful for detecting deception. We predict this instruction will weaken auditors’ learned tendency to overlook fraud cues. We find that auditors’ deception judgments are less accurate for fraud companies than for nonfraud companies, unless they receive this instruction. We also find that instructed auditors more extensively describe red flags for fraud companies and more accurately identify specific sentences in narratives that pertain to underlying frauds.

We initially discuss Ray Chambers’ and others’ desire for, and attempts to promote an international approach to accounting research and practice. Chambers unsuccessfully attempted to organize an international think‐tank, beginning in the mid‐1960s with something like the International Economic Association of that time. He persisted, through participation in the Accounting Researchers International Association, an elite accounting society. Eventually, those proposals were discarded as he and others like Adolf Enthoven and David Solomons proposed an international confederation of accounting educators and researchers in 1977 and 1978. Efforts of other leading accounting academics of that time, in particular Norlin Rueschhoff and Seigo Nakajima, are also shown to have influenced the eventual formation of the simplified 1984 IAAER body with, initially, its individual‐based membership and objectives.

0eaaabb2885e841e1138fcca7d30b3097b9c7164,Is There a Risk Premium in the Stock Lending Market? Evidence from Equity Options,"Pollet, Joshua",2022,"ABSTRACT Recent research argues that uncertainty about future stock borrowing fees hinders short‐selling, and this risk explains the performance of short strategies. One possible mechanism is that borrowing fee risk carries a risk premium.

Evidence from Demographic Demand Shifts,"Pollet, Joshua",2020,"Abstract We exploit variation in demand induced by demographics to provide causal evidence of the precautionary motive of cash holdings. We show that firms significantly increase their cash levels in response to exogenous increases in investment opportunities. We also provide novel evidence of the dynamics of accumulation and use of cash. Financially constrained firms build their cash reserves using internal sources. Consequently, they start saving earlier and keep high cash levels longer. Unconstrained firms rely on external financing to both invest and build cash reserves, requiring them to save less and allowing them to incur lower costs of carry.

Such strategies can offer an interesting alternative to target date funds, which have no focus on the generation of replacement income, or annuities, which can be used to secure replacement income but at the cost of substantial rigidity. TOPICS: Retirement, pension funds, wealth management Key Findings • Goal-based investing principles can be used to create retirement solutions that secure a minimum level of replacement income while delivering a high probability of reaching higher levels defined as aspirational goals. • These “flexicure” retirement solutions use a dedicated safe portfolio, known as a retirement goal-hedging bond portfolio (or retirement bond in short), which is a fixed-income portfolio whose cash flows (or factor exposures) match those of the stream of replacement income for a fixed period of time, say 20 years, in retirement. • Such strategies use liquid building blocks, they reliably secure a clearly identified replacement income goal without requiring ad hoc parametric assumptions, and they offer upside potential; as such they represent an attractive alternative to existing retirement products such as annuities or target date funds.",Semantic Scholar,86.11111111111111,10.3905/jor.2019.1.062,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b40e1e8323a0174203e918a470a0c8b56421985e,,"Raskie, S.

This realization has been widely heralded in the organizational ambidexterity literature. Our research extends this literature by introducing the concept of Relationship Ambidexterity (RA) and examining its antecedents and consequences. We propose that RA is a firm-level strategy in which a buyer is simultaneously committed to an existing supplier while actively pursuing diversification via new relations with potential suppliers. Thus, while organizational ambidexterity focuses on the simultaneous pursuit of existing and novel offerings, RA focuses on the simultaneous pursuit of existing and novel relationships. Our inquiry begins by integrating ambidexterity theory with insights gleaned from a qualitative study among nearly two dozen buyers to form a set of hypotheses. We then test these hypotheses via two survey studies (i.e., US and China) among nearly 550 respondents. Our findings reveal that RA is enhanced by buyer resources and experience and that supplier trust amplifies the effect of resources, while supplier market uncertainty weakens the effect of experience. Furthermore, our results also show that RA enhances firm performance, particularly when buyers have trusted suppliers and operate in uncertain supply markets.",Semantic Scholar,97.1428571428571,10.48550/arXiv.2411.15594,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e24424283c02fbe7f641e5b3490d7bb059f8355a,arXiv.org,"Gu, F., Wang, D., Wang, J., & Rindfleisch, A.

Grounded in meaning-making theory, the framework derives four categories of consumer meaning making in light of COVID-19. Then, the framework draws on life course research to theorize that the pandemic driven by the perceived severity of its impact on certain consumer segments can elicit turning point and cohort effects (e.g., decreased control and increased risk perceived by consumers).

In this paper, we present two studies conducted among over 900 adolescents that reveal a promising strategy for decreasing materialism: fostering gratitude. In Study 1, results from a nationally representative survey showed that children and adolescents with a grateful disposition were less materialistic. In Study 2, experimental evidence showed that an intervention designed to increase gratitude (i.e. keeping a gratitude journal) significantly reduced materialism among adolescents and also attenuated materialism’s negative effect on generosity. Using real money and donation as a behavioral measure, we found that adolescents who kept a gratitude journal donated 60% more of their earnings to charity compared to those in the control condition. We discuss the implications of our findings, offer some suggestions for putting our results into action, and provide an agenda for future research in this domain.",Semantic Scholar ,92.1875,10.1080/17439760.2018.1497688,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/727dbd439b8f0a64ed2355bc5082f068b9658390,Journal of Positive Psychology,"Chaplin, L., Roeddeer John, D., Rindfleisch, A., & Froh, J.

Ability, Preferences and Employee First Job Choice","Roach, Michael",2024,"Early stage technology startups rely critically on talented scientists and engineers to commercialize new technologies. And yet these startups compete with established technology firms to hire the best workers. Theories of ability sorting predict that high-ability workers will choose jobs in established firms that offer greater complementary assets and higher pay, leaving low-ability workers to take lower paying and riskier jobs in startups. We propose an alternative view in which heterogeneity in both worker ability and preferences enable startups to hire talented workers who have a taste for a startup work environment even at lower pay. Using a longitudinal survey that follows 2,394 science and engineering PhDs from graduate school into their first industrial employment, we overcome common empirical challenges by observing ability and stated preferences prior to entry into the labor market. We find that both ability and career preferences strongly predict startup employment with high-ability workers who prefer startup employment being the most likely to work in a startup. We show that this partly reflects dual selection effects whereby worker preferences result in a large pool of startup job applicants and startups make job offers to the most talented workers. Additional analyses confirm that startup employees earn approximately 17% lower pay. This gap is greatest for high-ability workers and persists over workers’ early careers, suggesting that they accept a negative compensating differential in exchange for the nonpecuniary benefits of startup employment. Data on job attributes and stated reasons for job choice further support this interpretation. This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.

Drawing on both preference and contextual theories of entrepreneurship, we examine how individuals’ interest in being a founder, a joiner, or neither forms prior to the first career transition. We find that although individuals with founder and joiner interests share similar preferences for entrepreneurial job attributes such as autonomy and risk, their preferences for these attributes also differ in significantly meaningful ways. Contextual factors such as norms, role models, and opportunities exhibit very different relationships with founder and joiner interests. Most interestingly, our results suggest that preferences and context interrelate in unique ways to shape different entrepreneurial interests. In particular, an interest in being a founder is most strongly associated with individuals’ preferences for entrepreneurial job attributes, whereas contextual factors do little to shape a founder interest in individuals who lack these preferences. An interest in being a joiner, on the other hand, is associated with both preferences and context, and this relationship is most pronounced for individuals with preferences that predispose them toward entrepreneurship.

They show that asking customers to rate a service professional before tipping negatively impacts the tip amount but that tipping first does not affect subsequent rating scores. The authors propose that the negative effect of rating on tipping occurs because, when rating a service professional first, customers categorize their feedback as a reward for the service professional, which partially alleviates the felt obligation to tip, resulting in a smaller tip. This negative effect is more evident when customers (1) tip from their own pocket, (2) have higher categorization flexibility, or (3) perceive that the service professional benefits from the rating. Moreover, highlighting the consistency motivation after rating but before tipping can attenuate this effect.

Results from seven studies reveal that bicultural consumers evaluate paradox brands more favorably and choose paradox brands more than traditional brands without contradictions. Furthermore, bicultural consumers exhibit more favorable evaluations and greater choice of paradox brands than do monocultural consumers. These cultural differences are attributable to greater cognitive flexibility found among biculturals, particularly those who adopt an acculturation strategy of integrating their different cultural identities. Greater cognitive flexibility, in turn, prompts stronger engagement with a paradox brand, which contributes to more favorable brand evaluations and choice.

Women in secret consumption conditions were instructed to imagine eating the food in secret, instructed to hide the food from others while consuming it, or shown an advertisement encouraging eating the food in secret. These secret consumption prompts resulted in more positive product evaluations and increased product choice, compared to evaluations in non-secret conditions. We identify preoccupation and attitude polarization as the primary drivers for these outcomes.

One lab experiment and a longitudinal study demonstrate general (vs. specific) goals expand the breadth of emotions experienced from consumption activities, which in turn impact the top‐of‐mind awareness of the consumption target over time; higher top‐of‐mind awareness of the target allows one to continue to derive happiness from it.

Given conservatives' greater tendency to conform to group norms than liberals, we theorize that conformity tendencies can increase donations by conservatives when accountable to a liberal audience who share a salient identity. Specifically, conservatives donate more when they are accountable to a liberal audience with whom they have a salient shared identity (Study 1) due to their motivation for social approval (Studies 3 and 4). However, if the donation context activates political identity (Studies 2 and 3) or if the unifying social identity is not salient (Study 4), accountability does not impact donation decisions. Notably, liberals do not alter their behavior, ruling out alternative explanations for the pattern of conformity. This research provides insight into the distinct role of accountability for conservatives and importance of audience characteristics for conformity. Though both liberals and conservatives can be generous, this research demonstrates how conformity can be used to increase charitable giving among conservatives.",Crossref,91.02564102564102,10.1016/j.jcps.2017.06.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2017.06.001,Journal of Consumer Psychology,"Kaikati, A., Torelli, C., Winterich, K., & Rodas, M.

For instance, as a tutor, GAI can aid students in grasping theoretical concepts, while as a teammate, it can foster collaboration by supporting brainstorming and problem-solving activities.

The model incorporates the key distinction of corporate diversification, economies of scope, that qualifies the analogy between corporate and portfolio diversification. The presence of a particular type of economies of scope, resource redeployability, not only inherently increases risk but it can also raise risk over the level in undiversified firms.

Research on redeployment proposes that managers should withdraw those resources from the business where they are underutilized and switch them to a business where they can be used more profitably, whereas the literature on divestiture advocates that managers should divest the business containing those resources. In this study, we investigate the factors that lead managers to choose resource redeployment over divestiture as a mode of exit and vice versa. Using a formal model, we establish that the two exit modes act as intertemporal substitutes, whereby redeployment dominates for earlier exits but divestiture dominates for later exits. Although both redeployment and divestiture are inversely related to their implementation costs, redeployment costs amplify the effect of divestiture costs on the likelihood of exit, and divestiture costs amplify the effect of redeployment costs on the likelihood of exit. Finally, we derive a series of results that show that disregarding one of these two exit options as a strategic alternative to the other may lead to misspecifications of empirical models that seek to predict the likelihood of redeployment, divestiture, or exit.

Such undervaluation lets firms buy resources relatively cheaply, but it can also constrain resource deployment. This article shows that the option to redeploy a firm's resources to a new business can be undervalued in stock markets when investors face ambiguity about that option due to uniqueness of redeployment. The developed formal model derives conditions under which stock markets undervalue resources. Those conditions are summarized with an empirical operationalization that can be tested with a broad range of strategic implications. Besides, the model provides a more complete account of resource redeployability by demonstrating the redeployability paradox. The paradox highlights that some determinants of redeployability enhance undervaluation, while simultaneously increasing objective value of redeployable resources. Managerial Summary : Stock markets can systematically undervalue resources. On the one hand, such undervaluation creates a profitable opportunity for a firm that needs some resources for its growth and compares the option to buy stock in another firm, whose resource are undervalued, with the option to build those resources internally. On the other hand, such undervaluation poses limits to resource deployment strategies of the undervalued firm. When does such undervaluation occur? This study highlights one possible source for undervaluation, ambiguity that is faced by stock market investors about the option to redeploy a firm's resources to a new business. The study specifies conditions under which stock markets are more likely to undervalue resources.

This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with inter‐temporal economies of scope, diversified firms are more likely to combine moderately related businesses than the most‐related businesses. That effect occurs because strong relatedness reduces redeployment costs and makes firms redeploy all resources to better performing businesses. The strength of that effect depends on inducements for redeployment measured as the current return advantage of one business over another business, volatilities of business returns, and correlation of those returns. This study develops hypotheses for those relationships and suggests empirical operationalizations, encouraging empiricists to retest the implications of relatedness for the dynamics of corporate diversification . Managerial summary: I t is believed that diversified firms are more likely to combine more‐related businesses because relatedness enables sharing of resources between businesses. Indeed, a firm can apply knowledge created in one business to another business, avoiding costly duplication in knowledge development. Resource sharing also adds value when a firm offers several products, adding the convenience of one‐stop shopping and charging higher prices. However, resource sharing is not the only motivation for corporate diversification. In environments where profitability of businesses changes frequently, firms diversify by redeploying part of resources from an underperforming business to a better performing business. This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with that second motivation for corporate diversification, firms end up combining moderately related businesses rather than the most‐related businesses .

Some research finds experts are plagued by overconfidence whereas others conclude that they are underconfident. We reviewed the literature, taking an interdisciplinary approach, to answer this question. In doing so, we assessed whether there were theoretical differences in how overconfidence and expertise were conceptualized across the literature. For overconfidence, there are three distinct conceptualizations with a fourth captured by economic models. People can be overconfident because they forecast a narrow range of possibilities that the truth frequently falls outside of (i.e. overprecision), overrate their judgments as correct (i.e. overestimation), or overbelieve they outperform their peers (i.e. overplacement). In economic models, overconfidence is at times assessed by the likelihood of engaging in unwise behavior and making inaccurate predictions. Likewise, there are divergent definitions of expertise. People can be identified as experts because of their experience (i.e. time on task), because of enhanced performance on knowledge tests, or because of their job title or professional degree. These conceptual and theoretical inconsistencies are crucial in answering whether experts are overconfident. For overprecision, experts are overprecise across all theoretical definitions of expertise. However, this consistency is likely because overprecision is so robust across people regardless of whether they are experts. For overestimation, we found experts of experience and experts of title typically overestimated, with mixed results for the experts of knowledge. Studies of overplacement are limited, often defining experts via knowledge, but find that they tend to underplace their abilities.

To be sure, beginners can range from rank beginners, those who have acquired no knowledge, to experienced beginners, beginners who having gained some but not vast knowledge. Next, I discuss the beginner's bubble that follows the trajectory of confidence and overconfidence as people transition from rank to experienced beginners.

In Studies 1a and 1b, JTC was associated with errors stimulated by automatic reasoning, oddball beliefs such as conspiracy theories, and overconfidence. We traced these deficits to an absence of controlled processing rather than to an undue impact of automatic thinking, while ruling out roles for plausible alternative individual differences. In Studies 2 and 3, JTC was associated with higher confidence despite diminished performance in a novel probabilistic learning task (i.e., diagnosing illnesses), in part because those who exhibited JTC behavior were prone to overly exuberant theorizing, with no or little data, about how to approach the task early on. In Study 4, we adapted intervention materials used in schizophrenia treatment to train participants to avoid JCT. The intervention quelled overconfidence in the probabilistic learning task.

In 4 of the studies, participants completed multicue probabilistic learning tasks (e.g., learning to diagnose ""zombie diseases"" from physical symptoms). Although beginners did not start out overconfident in their judgments, they rapidly surged to a ""beginner's bubble"" of overconfidence. This bubble was traced to exuberant and error-filled theorizing about how to approach the task formed after just a few learning experiences. Later trials challenged and refined those theories, leading to a temporary leveling off of confidence while performance incrementally improved, although confidence began to rise again after this pause. In 2 additional studies we found a real-world echo of this pattern of overconfidence across the life course. Self-ratings of financial literacy surged among young adults, then leveled off among older respondents until late adulthood, where it begins to rise again, with actual financial knowledge all the while rising more slowly, consistently, and incrementally throughout adulthood.

The cooperative buys raw groundnuts (input commodity) from member farmers and processes them into multiple grades of groundnut seeds (output commodity). These may then be blended to create intermediate grades to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The cooperative sells part of the output on the spot market while storing the rest for future periods. A key challenge is the random supply of input commodity—driven by the cooperative’s obligation to accept all member produce—and the option to blend the output. Unlike prior work, this study examines blending across a multiperiod planning horizon, a novel aspect in operations management literature. The problem is modeled as a dynamic program over a harvest season. We analyze the structure of the optimal value function and decisions and find that the function is not separable in input and output inventories, which complicates the identification of optimal solution. However, in special cases such as when blending is disallowed, the function simplifies. An efficient computational procedure is developed for the general case.

We consider this problem using a single period inventory model where demand and price are realized at time T and the stocking decision may be made at any time in the interval [0, T ]. The processes for the firm's value as well as that of the market evolve as geometric Brownian motions. We show that the right to make the optimal inventory decision is a modified American-style option. However, since the stochastic variables defining the forecasts of demand and price are not tradeable, we cannot use standard dynamic hedging arguments in the Black-Scholes-Merton sense. Therefore, we use a risk-adjusted valuation approach for incomplete markets to determine the optimal timing strategy. Our model provides results regarding the value of the option to postpone inventory procurement as a function of the key parameters: the market price of risk, the volatilities of price and demand, the correlation between these two variables and the return on the market portfolio, and the procurement cost. We illustrate the empirical validity of our model by testing it on firms in the gold mining industry.

The lessons learnt from that experience is that flexibility in responding to demand and modularity must be planned at every stage. Along with planning, we argue that execution becomes challenging and is equally important to consider when making plans. We illustrate with a broad category of flexibility and modularity, dual sourcing, and how management mathematics can be used to manage these systems and understand the cost of execution. Dual sourcing has been used to manage the trade-off between cost and responsiveness by firms and has received considerable attention in academic literature. It is known that except in special cases, the optimal sourcing policy does not have an easy structure that is practically appealing and can be used by managers. Over the last decade and half, researchers have developed various management mathematics techniques and analyzed the performance of heuristic policies. This paper presents a discussion of the results in a few key papers related to the dual-sourcing inventory management problem and recent distribution free results in asymptotic regions. The asymptotic regimes considered include systems where the lead-time from the slower supplier is significantly higher than that from the closer, faster supplier and conditions where the unit cost of procurement is significantly higher compared to the unit cost of carrying inventory. These regimes represent different conditions about how valuable or costly using the faster supplier is and illustrate the value of simple heuristic policies and characterize the cost of these heuristics. The key learnings are that optimal ordering decisions may be robust to misspecification of demand distribution and managers only need summary statistics, such as the average and standard deviation of demand to determine the order quantities from the different suppliers. Managers could also consider ways to roll out new planning and control systems for managing multiple suppliers.",Crossref,90.58823529411765,10.1093/imaman/dpae019,https://doi.org/10.1093/imaman/dpae019,IMA Journal of Management Mathematics,"Devalkar, S., & Seshadri, S.

Academic/practical relevance: During the era of global supply chain restructuring, researchers and executives of multinational firms should understand variations of the foreign subsidiary’s bullwhip effect, given that its reduction is a key strategy for coordinating supply chains. Methodology: Our work is based on a balanced panel data set of Korean-owned subsidiaries that provides distinguishable information on subsidiary purchases. It enables us to estimate an alternative measure for the bullwhip effect by the ratio of purchase volatility to demand volatility and compare it with the traditional measure of the ratio of production volatility to demand volatility. Results: Our alternative measure differs significantly from the traditional measure and better reflects the prevalence of the bullwhip effect across foreign subsidiaries. Using this new measure, we find that the bullwhip effect is strongly affected by country-specific factors and foreign subsidiary-specific factors. These findings support not only previous analytical findings on the bullwhip effect but also provide new remedies to reduce the bullwhip effect. Managerial implications: Our study advises managers of multinational firms. First, although locating foreign subsidiaries in developing countries tends to reduce production costs, it could instead increase the bullwhip effect, especially for politically unstable countries or those with lower import penetration. Second, we provide empirical evidence that relocating a subsidiary to a country close to its main suppliers or to one that incurs lower transportation costs will reduce the bullwhip effect. Finally, deploying expatriate managers and wholly owning the subsidiary are recommended strategies to reduce the bullwhip effect of foreign subsidiaries.

However, these industrial policies created an incentive for firms to remain small so that they can continue to avail of the benefits provided by the Government. On the positive side, the MSMEs typically employ more labor intensive production processes and consequently contribute significantly to the provision of employment opportunities, generation of income, and poverty reduction. But, on the negative side, the policies have also partly facilitated the creation of a divide in terms of productivity between the MSMEs and large sized firms. In particular the policy raises important questions for a firm auctioning supply contracts among suppliers with a significant cost differential. In this paper we propose an idea to allocate supply contracts wherein a manufacturing firm partitions the stochastic demand into mutually exclusive portions and awards each portion to a different supplier. We characterize such an optimal procurement mechanism when there are two types of suppliers and an arbitrary number of demand portions. We show that the optimal procurement may require the manufacturer to intentionally withhold some demand portion, and this arises when one type of supplier is considerably inefficient in serving a demand portion. We extend our analysis to the cases with multiple types with two suppliers and two types with multiple suppliers. The optimal partition is composed of at most six contiguous demand portions, and it may include a detrimental demand portion that only generates a negative expected payoff to both supplier types. Our demand partitioning mechanism leads to a strictly higher manufacturer's expected payoff than the conventional winner‐take‐all case unless one supplier type completely dominates the other. We present numerical experiments that indicate when such a mechanism holds the greatest advantage for the buyer.",Crossref,100.0,10.1002/nav.21953,https://doi.org/10.1002/nav.21953,Naval Research Logistics (NRL),"Chen, Y., Seshadri, S., & Sohoni, M.

a9ba039599e16c31b9d6b09cdee8412bb7dddb42,Effect of Financing Costs and Constraints on Real Investments: The Case of Inventories,"Seshadri, Sridhar",2019,"This paper studies the effects of bank credit availability, trade credit and the capital cost on inventory decisions. There are two competing theories on the effect of bank credit lines on investments. While one (Lins et al. 2010) suggests that the primary role played by undrawn credit is to finance new opportunities, the other (Acharya et al. 2014) suggests that undrawn credit serves primarily as a bank monitored liquidity insurance. We attempt to resolve these two conflict views in the context of inventory investments. Using empirical data, we show that the primary role of undrawn credit depends on the individual firm’s financial status. When a firm is financially constrained, its inventory decisions are linked to the additional bank credit available to the firm—echoing the insurance nature of bank credits. On the other hand, when a firm is financially healthy, two other inventory financing factors play more significant roles than undrawn credits. For financially healthy firms, inventory investments are significantly negatively related to the financial cost of inventory and positively related to the credit offered by suppliers. Additionally, we study the financial crisis of 2007–2008 as a systematic shock in the credit market to identify the effects of a firm’s financial credits. We show that during the financial crisis, the inventory turnover and working capital levels of US retailers were related to the availability of bank credit. However, immediately after the crisis, the evidence demonstrates the positive relationship between firms’ inventory level and the trade credit they are offered.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.13062,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13062,Production and Operations Management,"Wu, Q., Muthuraman, K., & Seshadri, S.

First, a firm (OEM) sources from multiple suppliers who have limited capacity and correlated disruption risk. After the supply is realized, the firm also has access to the spot market for the extra material needed for its production. The firm must decide (1) which suppliers to source from, (2) how much to source from them, and (3) how much to produce and how much to source from the spot market. We formulate this as a stochastic optimization problem to study the tradeoff the firm faces between costs and default risk. In order to incorporate the correlation of the supplier’s default risk, we use the t-copula dependence structure. A contract default is a rare event. Thus, in a Monte Carlo simulation, there is considerable variance around the optimal sourcing quantity. This variance leads to complexity in computing the optimal decision. We find that a diligent combination of importance sampling and conditional Monte Carlo schemes effectively reduces the variance in simulation estimates for the first-order conditions in the stochastic optimization problem. This paper shows that, for a supply chain with correlated default risks, the optimal sourcing problem can be solved by using importance sampling and a conditional Monte Carlo simulation.",Semantic Scholar ,90.0,10.3233/rda-180049,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6d3ed507ab8d0e9a1ae0a17a46a23a609b7a3b4,Risk and Decision Analysis,"Qi, W., Haksoz, C., Sak, H., & Seshadri, S.

We consider a multi‐period setting where two firms process a common commodity to meet stochastic demands. They can buy and sell the commodity through both the spot and forward markets. They can also share the commodity if one has leftover inventory while the other has excess demand. We first characterize the equilibrium strategies of the two firms. Our analysis reveals that in such a context, the value of inventory sharing is low when the forward price is directly used to value the sharing transactions. We then develop a structured trans‐shipment price scheme that uses a linear combination of the spot and forward prices. We show that this method can substantially increase the value of inventory sharing. Our analysis also reveals that in the presence of liquid spot and forward markets, the value of inventory sharing mainly results from the difference of the transaction costs, and it increases if the market in which firms operate becomes more competitive.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12551,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12551,Production and Operations Management,"Park, S., Lai, G., & Seshadri, S.

Nonetheless, during times of economic downturn, some industries take the biggest hit, whereas at times of economic boom they reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon, we map supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks. We demonstrate three managerial implications of this phenomenon: implications for the cost of capital, for the risk-adjusted valuation of supply chain improvement projects, and for supplier selection and risk.

A practically implementable policy for such a firm is a tailored base-surge (TBS) policy [Allon G, Van Mieghem JA (2010) Global dual sourcing: Tailored base-surge allocation to near- and offshore production. Management Sci. 56(1):110–124] to manage its inventory. Under this policy, the firm procures a constant quantity from the regular supplier in every period and dynamically makes procurement decisions for the emergency supplier. Allon and Van Mieghem describe this practice as using the regular supplier to meet a base level of demand and the emergency supplier to manage demand surges, and they conjecture that this practice is most effective when the lead time difference between the two suppliers is large. We confirm these statements in two ways. First, we show the following analytical result: when demand is composed of a base demand random component plus a surge demand random component, which occurs with a certain small probability, the best TBS policy is close to optimal (over all policies) in a well-defined sense. Second, we also numerically investigate the cost effectiveness of the best TBS policy on a test bed of problem instances. The emphasis of this investigation is the study of the effect of the lead time difference between the two suppliers. Our study reveals that the cost difference between the best TBS policy and the optimal policy decreases dramatically as the lead time of the regular supplier increases. On our test bed, this cost difference decreases from an average (over the test bed) of 21% when the lead time from the regular supplier is two periods (the emergency supplier offers instant delivery) to 3.5% when that lead time is seven periods.

Next, by modeling demand as a diffusion process, we reformulate the inventory control problem as an impulse control problem. We simplify the impulse control problem to a Quasi-Variation Inequality (QVI). Based on the QVI formulation, we obtain the optimality of the (s, S) policy and the limiting distribution of the inventory level. We also obtain the long run average cost of such an inventory system. Finally, we provide a method to solve the QVI formulation.

We focus on illuminating actions of multiple and heterogeneous actors that help reduce high technological and demand uncertainty, thereby shaping industry structure and strategic action post‐commercialization.

With the advancement of mobile technologies, many apps have been developed to facilitate health self-management. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of these mobile health (mHealth) apps in motivating exercise adherence. Objective This study aims to demonstrate the enhanced action design research (ADR) process and improve the design of mHealth apps for exercise self-management. Specifically, we investigate whether sending motivational messages improves adherence to exercise plans, whether the motivational effect is affected by personality, the impact of message type and repetition, and the process of involving a field experiment in the design process and learning new design principles from the results. Methods This formative research was conducted by proposing an enhanced ADR process. We incorporated a field experiment into the process to iteratively refine and evaluate the design until it converges into a final mHealth app. We used the Apple ResearchKit to develop the mHealth app and promoted it via trainers at their gyms. We targeted users who used the app for at least two months. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 12 groups in a 2×3×2 factorial design and remained blinded to the assigned intervention. The groups were defined based on personality type (thinking or feeling), message type (emotional, logical, or none), and repetition (none or once). Participants with different personality types received tailored and repeated messages. Finally, we used the self-reported completion rate to measure participants’ adherence level to exercise plans. By analyzing users’ usage patterns, we could verify, correct, and enhance the mHealth app design principles. Results In total, 160 users downloaded the app, and 89 active participants remained during the 2-month period. The results suggest a significant main effect of personality type and repetition and a significant interaction effect between personality type and repetition. The adherence rate of people with feeling personality types was 18.15% higher than that of people with thinking types. Emotional messages were more effective than logical messages in motivating exercise adherence. Although people received repeated messages, they were more likely to adhere to exercise plans. With repeated reminders, the adherence rates of people with thinking personality types were significantly improved by 27.34% (P Conclusions This study contributes to the literature on mHealth apps.

However, questions pertaining to the decision rationale applied for IS portfolio prioritization (why are certain initiatives approved, and why are certain others rejected), noted to be a critical component of IS governance, need further investigation. We submit that the IS strategy of a firm is likely to explain the decision rationale it applies to IS portfolio prioritization and maintain that it is critical to ensure this decision rationale is in congruence with the firm’s IS strategy. By extending prior theoretical work on IS strategy types, we develop theoretical profiles of the decision rationale applied to IS portfolio prioritization using three attributes: communicability of decision rationale, consistency in applying decision rationale, and risk appropriateness of decision rationale.

Across six experiments (N = 4,956) and a field study on Facebook, interracial couples in marketing appeals enhance brand outcomes relative to monoracial dominant (i.e., White) couples, but decrease brand outcomes relative to monoracial nondominant (i.e., minority) couples. These effects stem from how the racial composition of dominant (vs. nondominant) members within a couple either amplifies or dilutes perceived warmth. Monoracial couples possess consistent stereotype attributes, with dominant (vs. nondominant) groups typically seen as lower in warmth. Thus, monoracial couple warmth is amplified: monoracial dominant couples are seen as less warm (i.e., negative amplification), and monoracial nondominant couples as warmer (i.e., positive amplification) than the individuals in the couple. Interracial couples possess inconsistent racial attributes, inducing stereotype dilution with intermediate levels of perceived warmth. Warmth drives brand outcomes above and beyond brand diversity, social desirability, and brand morality. Effects are moderated by consumers’ social dominance orientation and whether the monoracial dominant couple is nondominant along another dimension (i.e., sexual orientation).

The authors theorize that simple packaging evokes a symbolic association whereby minimizing design complexity signals that the product contains few ingredients, which increases perceived product purity and willingness to pay (WTP). A field study examining a supermarket chain's product packages (N = 1,353) provided preliminary support for this increase in WTP and two boundary conditions. Six preregistered studies replicated these effects and tested the underlying process. Studies 1a and 1b showed that the increase in WTP for simple packaging is driven by few-ingredients inferences increasing perceived product purity. Study 2 demonstrated the increase in WTP using an incentive-compatible design. Study 3 reinforced the proposed process via moderated mediation. Lastly, Studies 4 and 5 tested the boundary conditions in the field study, showing that WTP for simple packaging decreases when the product is from a store (vs. nonstore) brand and when consumers have an indulgence (vs. health) goal.

Here, we find that certain forms of heritage branding can also have potentially negative consequences by leading consumers to react negatively to changes made to the brand’s original, flagship product—even if those changes objectively improve it. We demonstrate that when firms engage in heritage branding that emphasizes a brand’s longevity, consumers evaluate enhanced products less favorably than the original versions of those same products due to decreased perceptions of continuity authenticity. We demonstrate this effect across a variety of product domains (e.g., cosmetics, cookware, and food products), using online experiments as well as in-person product trials. Moreover, we provide a framework that distinguishes between types of heritage branding cues that lead to negative evaluations of enhanced products versus those that do not. Finally, beyond identifying an important boundary condition based on specific aspects of heritage branding, we further show how the negative evaluations of enhanced products can be attenuated if brands reframe product changes as continuous with the brand’s origins.

This article draws on existentialist notions of authenticity (wherein the true self is created rather than innate) to explore how framing beauty work as self-expression alters others’ perceptions and, in turn, marketing outcomes. First, an archival analysis of Instagram posts demonstrates that rebranding beauty work as self-expression is positively associated with word-of-mouth about beauty products. Six studies then test how motivational information alters perceptions of people who engage in beauty work. Lowered authenticity perceptions arise from observers’ default assumption that beauty work is motivated by self-enhancement and serves primarily to conceal appearances. By contrast, self-expression enhances authenticity by leading others to see beauty work as a form of creation rather than concealment. This pattern extends to when people engage in a variety of beauty work transformations but not when beauty work is designed to restore appearances or is framed as connected to the innate self.

While behaving consistently has generally been found to enhance perceptions of authenticity, 10 studies demonstrate that performers who are revealed to be self-repeating are perceived as less authentic. We find convergent evidence that this effect is driven by observers' implicit assumption that social interactions are unique. Self-repetitions violate this assumption, leading observers to judge performers as inauthentic because they are thought to be falsely presenting their performance as unique when it is not. We demonstrate this effect across multiple contexts (politics, entrepreneurship, tour guiding, and comedy), finding that observer awareness of self-repetition decreases perceived authenticity even in situations in which it is normative to repeat a performance and in which repetition is required. The decrease in authenticity is eliminated only when performers overtly acknowledge self-repetition, as performers are no longer viewed as falsely presenting themselves. Moreover, performers who fail to acknowledge their self-repetition are penalized similarly to those who explicitly lie that the performance is unique-an unacknowledged self-repetition is thus seen as a lie by omission. Finally, we recorded repeated job interview responses and found that observers who were unaware of the self-repetition could not discern tangible differences between unrepeated and repeated responses. However, when observers believed that they were viewing a self-repetition, they judged the interviewees as less authentic.

Consequently, research suggests that information about mistakes is rarely shared with consumers. However, we find that consumers actually prefer products that were made by mistake to otherwise identical products that were made intentionally. This preference arises because consumers perceive that a product made by mistake is more improbable relative to a product made intentionally, and thus, view the product as more unique. We find converging evidence for this preference in a field study, six experiments, and eBay auction sales. Importantly, this preference holds regardless of whether the mistake enhances or detracts from the product.

We explain this phenomenon through a theory about how attributes of firms' resource bundles impact their scale and specialization. We posit that highly scalable resource bundles entail significant opportunity costs of integration (vs. outsourcing), which simultaneously drive “hyperspecialization” and “hyperscaling” in digital firms. Using descriptive theory and a formal model, we develop several propositions that align with observed features of digital businesses. We offer a parsimonious modeling framework for resource‐based theorizing about highly scalable digital firms, shed light on the phenomenon of digital scaling, and provide insights into the far‐reaching ways that technology‐enabled resources are reshaping firms in the digital economy. Managerial Summary Why are leading firms in the digital economy simultaneously larger and more specialized than those in the industrial age? Our research explains this phenomenon as being driven by the scalability of digital resources—that is, their capacity to create more value at larger scales when used intensively in a focal activity. We clarify what digital scalability means, and highlight trade‐offs created by the opportunity costs of not employing scalable digital resources intensively. Digital firms should outsource complementary activities to avoid diverting resources away from their scalable core, and to enhance their ability to grow exponentially. Although resource fungibility and outsourcing costs mitigate these imperatives, digital firms may nonetheless find it profitable to remain specialized despite the challenges of managing outsourcing and sharing value with complementors.",Crossref,92.5925925925926,10.1002/smj.3365,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3365,Strategic Management Journal,"Giustiziero, G., Kretchmer, T., Somaya, D., & Wu, B.

We leverage a set of natural experiments resulting from quasi-exogenous changes in two legal mobility barriers to show that mobility barriers enhanced inventor team size, formation of new co-inventor ties, and combination of inventors possessing heterogeneous knowledge in U.S. manufacturing firms.

Our theorizing rests on the foundation that a firm’s business growth stems from its breadth (or volume) of opportunities for creating added value with buyers, which more fully realizes the Penrosean vision that firm growth can be explained by a dynamic interaction between productive resources and demand-side market opportunities. Although relational embeddedness may give a supplier dyadic advantages with focal buyers, which supports business growth, we theorize that it can also lead to narrower added value business opportunities with the supplier’s entire portfolio of buyers. Critically, we hypothesize that the effect of relational embeddedness on business growth is moderated by a set of relational and demand-side attributes. These hypotheses are tested on a panel data set of patent law firms (suppliers) and their relationships with corporate clients (buyers). We find that greater relational embeddedness is associated with slower supplier business growth, and consistent with our hypotheses, this negative effect is alleviated when these firms have greater cross-servicing ability and receive more relational commitment from buyers but exacerbated when suppliers hold more buyer-specific knowledge and when buyers undertake more (internal) concurrent sourcing. In turn, our research demonstrates how the attributes of a supplier’s relationships with its portfolio of buyers can impact access to new business opportunities and thus opens up new directions for research on firm growth, demand-side strategy and buyer-supplier relationships.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/orsc.2020.1415,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.1415,Organization Science,"Mawdsley, J., & Somaya, D.

While prior research suggests a number of factors that enable exporting by new ventures, empirical tests of these theories have not evaluated if these factors uniquely explain new venture exporting. We propose and empirically test hypotheses that exporting by young (relative to established) emerging‐economy firms increases when they tap into the drivers of modern globalization (Internet technologies, global talent flows) and overcome home‐country institutional constraints (government inefficiencies, location), all of which have bigger impacts on exporting by young firms than established ones. Understanding these unique drivers of born global emerging‐economy firms is critical for reconciling this phenomenon with traditional theories of firm internationalization. Managerial Summary Our research finds that exporting by young firms are enabled to a greater extent (than established firms) when they use Internet technologies and tap into mobile talent (such as cross‐national entrepreneurs and leaders with international experience), which helps to overcome key constraints in tapping into international markets. We also found that young firms overcome home‐country institutional and infrastructure deficiencies in emerging economies, specifically, by receiving efficient government services and strategically locating in well‐resourced centers such as capital cities, which helps them more in exporting as compared to established firms.

In quantitative analyses of a representative survey of German firms, we find that key firm-level attributes—firm scope, innovation expenses, product innovation, collaboration breadth, and use of patents—are associated with a need to use such defensive IP measures.

We propose that client‐led diversification results from a combination of the customer‐driven opportunities emphasized in the demand‐side view and the creation of added value through relational assets that is a central tenet of the relational view. Furthermore, we hypothesize that suppliers’ client‐specific knowledge, clients’ relational commitment to suppliers, and growth opportunities in clients’ markets (relative to the suppliers’ own markets) will magnify the client‐led diversification effect. We test our hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset on patent law firms and their diversification into new domains of patent prosecution work for their corporate clients. Managerial Summary: Explanations of why firms diversify into new lines of business have largely concerned the redeployment of underutilized resources, with little regard to opportunities or influences stemming from firms’ existing customers. In our article, we show how the changing scope of business needs from a knowledge‐based supplier firm's set of existing clients is a central driver of supplier‐firm diversification, and this is especially the case when the level of relational assets shared between a supplier and its clients is higher.

As employees increasingly pursue boundaryless careers that straddle multiple organizations, it is important to ask: Do advantages from LMX extend beyond the current organization and persist even after employees have left it? We propose that employees in higher quality LMX relationships with their managers benefit from stronger professional development, which can pay off in the form of better career outcomes on the external job market. Further, after leaving, whether or not ex‐employees (i.e., alumni) harbor goodwill toward their former organizations is likely to depend on their LMX quality prior to leaving. Alumni goodwill matters because organizations can potentially reap important strategic benefits from their alumni. Using time separated data including alumni interviews conducted by third‐party consultants, we find that, among employees who quit, pre‐turnover LMX is positively related to higher salaries and greater responsibility in their next jobs and is also positively related to alumni goodwill. Moreover, the strength of the LMX–alumni goodwill relationship depends on whether managers made robust retention efforts after employees communicated their decisions to quit.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/peps.12143,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12143,Personnel Psychology,"Raghuram, S., Gajendran, R., Liu, X., & Somaya, D.

Thus, patent litigation provides an interesting context in which to explore aspects of firm’s non-market strategies. In contrast with prior non-market strategy research that has largely focused on how political institutions define the rules of the game for market competition, non-market actions within patent litigation primarily seek to access and apply these broad policies to specific situations, products, or assets that matter to the firm. Furthermore, because such non-market actions are directly influenced by the firms’ market strategies, they represent a promising area for research on integrated (market and non-market) strategies as well. The goal of this paper is to explain how generic patent strategies that firms use to support their competitive advantage in the product-market influence non-market outcomes related to the timing of patent litigation resolution. In contrast with prior research that has studied settlement in patent litigation essentially as a one-shot bargaining game, this paper seeks to explain litigation resolution as an outcome of the competing mechanisms of settlement and adjudication that operate continually during litigation. Using a large sample of patent litigations in research medicines and computers, I model the timing of patent litigation resolution in a proportional hazards framework, wherein settlement and adjudication are competing risks. The evidence found is consistent with the proposition that the speed with which patent litigation is resolved by either settlement or adjudication reflects the use of proprietary, defensive, and leveraging patent strategies by firms.

However, extant research on the topic is highly fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical framework, impeding the development of a cumulative conceptually integrated body of research. We seek to remedy this situation by undertaking a review of research on employee mobility and its organizational impacts and casting it within a novel integrative conceptual framework. As a critical foundation for this framework, we highlight how the various organizational impacts of employee mobility are ultimately engendered by different dimensions of human and/or relational capital that are conveyed by mobile individuals. Building on this foundation, we describe how multilevel contextual factors—characterized as attributes of the employee, source and destination firms, and environmental conditions—may moderate the transfer and utilization of human and relational capital held by mobile individuals. Finally, we review how constraining factors, such as labor market imperfections on both demand and supply sides, can impede employee mobility and also how alternative competing channels—for example, alliances, networks and geographic spillovers, and acquisitions—may be used for effectuating the same organizational impacts as mobility events. These constraints and competing channels are important because they circumscribe the conditions under which employee mobility can be a critical influence on organizational outcomes.

The fundamental property is accruals that originate must subsequently reverse. The behavioral phenomenon is individuals tend to underestimate the variance of noisy signals in various domains of decision making. We argue that originating accruals represents a noisier signal than reversing accruals because the uncertainty of whether originating accruals will eventually convert into cash is high, while there is no uncertainty regarding reversing accruals. If investors underestimate the variance of originating accruals but understand reversing accruals, then originating accruals will be mispriced while reversing accruals will not. To test this prediction, we first develop and empirically validate a novel method for ex ante detecting accrual originations and their reversals. Then we document that investors face increased uncertainty when accruals originate and decreased uncertainty when accruals reverse, and we provide evidence that only originating accruals are mispriced. We further demonstrate that our findings can be useful for improving the accrual‐based trading strategy by ex ante detecting and removing accrual reversals from extreme accrual portfolios. Overall, we provide a behavioral explanation for the accrual anomaly that is consistent with the mispricing of originating accruals only.",Crossref,92.5925925925926,10.1111/1911-3846.12538,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12538,Contemporary Accounting Research,"Fedyk, T., Singer, Z., & Sougiannis, T.

For this, we analyze data from 16 European countries over the period 2005–2015. We find macroeconomic expectations to be useful in predicting future profitability only during non-crisis periods and mainly for firms facing elastic demand for their products and services and firms without sequential losses. Current profitability as well as its cash flow and accruals components are much more informative predictors of future profitability than macroeconomic expectations in both non-crisis and crisis periods. Market pricing tests suggest that macroeconomic expectations are not informative and thus not priced by market participants during crisis periods and support efficient pricing of current profitability under both non-crisis and crisis periods. However, it is the cash flow component of profitability that is efficiently priced under both economic conditions, while the accrual component of profitability is mispriced during crisis periods.

The case demonstrates that the type of entity is very influential in the determination of the tax liability at the entity and owner level. Further, this case enhances critical-thinking skills by allowing students to develop and apply their knowledge of: book and tax financial accounting; the tax basis calculations of the ownership interests; and the computation of tax liabilities for each organizational form. The integrative nature of this case is something that is typically not addressed in textbooks or tax courses as it spans both entity and owner levels of analysis. This challenges students to evaluate and compare taxation at the various levels and then synthesize their results for understanding the business relevance. The challenging, integrative nature of the case is representative of the business decisions taxpayers make and helps foster a better understanding of the impact taxes have on business decisions, while creating a robust educational environment for the students.",Crossref,100.0,10.2308/iace-51602,https://doi.org/10.2308/iace-51602,Issues in Accounting Education,"Drnevich, D., & Sternburg, T.

Given textual corpora, such as consumer reviews and online discussion forums, researchers and business practitioners often use topic modeling to either explore data in an unsupervised fashion or generate variables of interest for subsequent econometric analysis. However, one important concern stems from the fact that topic models can be notorious for their instability, i.e., the generated results could be inconsistent and irreproducible at different times, even on the same dataset. Therefore, researchers might arrive at potentially unreliable results regarding the theoretical relationships that they are testing or developing. In this paper, we attempt to highlight this problem and suggest a potential approach to addressing it. First, we empirically define and evaluate the stability problem of topic models using four textual datasets. Next, to alleviate the problem and with the goal of extracting actionable insights from textual data, we propose a new method, Stable LDA, which incorporates topical word clusters into the topic model to steer the model inference toward consistent results. We show that the proposed Stable LDA approach can significantly improve model stability while maintaining or even improving the topic model quality. Further, employing two case studies related to an online knowledge community and online consumer reviews, we demonstrate that the variables generated from Stable LDA can lead to more consistent estimations in econometric analyses. We believe that our work can further enhance management scholars’ collective toolkit to analyze ever-growing textual data.",Semantic Scholar,97.6470588235294,10.1186/s13068-019-1503-y,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b36367b5932cd0b24d88a5eebaff721546e73c25,Biotechnology for Biofuels,"Yang, Y., & Subramanyam, R.

As these platforms become increasingly important channels for bottom-up resource mobilization, it is essential to understand their vulnerability to shifts in public perception caused by top-down, off-platform events. We examine the effect of legislative signals on online giving behavior in the context of public education. We analyze how the ratification of the prominent Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) impacted giving behavior on a leading education crowdfunding platform and find two contrasting donor tendencies. Although donors contributed more to local initiatives following the ratification, they contributed less to nonlocal initiatives, leading to a substantial net decline in the funds raised. These effects manifest through two mechanisms: information push and information pull. This hyper-localization exacerbates the resource-divide problem in education; schools with students of lower socioeconomic status experienced a sharper decline in the proportion of projects funded. This finding suggests the usefulness of timed and targeted nudges by platform managers, especially around the announcement of major external events.

We submit that the IS strategy of a firm is likely to explain the decision rationale it applies to IS portfolio prioritization and maintain that it is critical to ensure this decision rationale is in congruence with the firm’s IS strategy. By extending prior theoretical work on IS strategy types, we develop theoretical profiles of the decision rationale applied to IS portfolio prioritization using three attributes: communicability of decision rationale, consistency in applying decision rationale, and risk appropriateness of decision rationale. Since the decision rationale applied for IS portfolio prioritization is often tacit, unknown even to the decision makers themselves, we employ the decision tree induction methodology to discover this tacit decision rationale. We analyze over 150 IS portfolio prioritization decisions on a multimillion dollar IS portfolio of a multibusiness, Fortune 50 firm and our findings, which support our propositions, indicate that firms that adopt different IS strategies rely on systematically different profiles of decision rationale for IS portfolio prioritization.

Recent trends toward localizing branch-campus hiring have raised questions about the extent to which non-parent-campus lecturers will support global integration pursuits. This paper aims to examine IBC lecturers’ orientations towards global integration, exploring how they identify themselves and their campuses as part of their wider universities. Design/methodology/approach Employing constructivist grounded theory methodology, 37 lecturers and leaders at four Australian branch campuses in Southeast Asia were interviewed, engaging them in semi-structured discussions of their identities and experiences. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using NVivo in an iterative process of theory development. Findings Branch-campus lecturers interviewed generally construct their individual and campus identities as separate from their wider universities. Barriers to branch campuses’ global integration include low organizational identification of lecturers, challenges in their relationships with headquarters colleagues and perceptions of cross-campus disparities in resources and students. Branch campuses’ organizationally separate identities are enacted in practice, fueling a self-reinforcing “Othering Loop” that could undermine these campuses’ quality and viability. Originality/value This research is the first emic exploration of locally-hired branch-campus lecturers’ views toward global integration.

While nationalism can promote social solidarity and progress, it also has the potential to deepen divisions and fuel conflict—realities that organizations cannot ignore. In this paper, we propose a theory of organizational nationalism, which positions organizations not merely as passive responders to nationalist institutional pressures or geopolitical risks but as active agents in shaping nationalistic beliefs, values, and policies. Through theorizing how organizational nationalism manifests and functions, we offer insights into how organizations harness nationalism to motivate employees, cultivate consumer loyalty, and secure sociopolitical legitimacy, and how such engagement may eventually become an organizational commitment that shapes its nationalist character. This perspective fills a critical void in nationalism research by emphasizing the intermediary role played by organizations between the state and individual levels of nationalism. It also offers a unifying framework for the fragmented literature on nationalism in business, which spans topics from state influence on organizational forms to managing “foreignness” in multinational corporations.

Because these joint criteria are inherently contradictory, we examine whether legally immaterial redacted information is economically material to investors. We find that firms’ stock price discovery process is significantly slower and insider trading is significantly greater after companies file redacted contracts compared to nonredacted contracts. We then examine the impact of the 2019 FAST Act, which reduced the SEC’s oversight of redacted contracts. Companies redact more frequently and insider trading (but not speed of stock price discovery) is more pronounced after the FAST Act. Taken together, these findings suggest that at least some redacted information is economically material to investors and that reducing SEC oversight of redacted information may not be in investors’ best interests.

This shift in consumer markets presents a challenge for marketers as they try to design brand strategies to serve this important group. In this article, the authors show that certain types of brands, specifically paradox brands that incorporate contradictory brand meanings, are particularly appealing to bicultural consumers. Results from seven studies reveal that bicultural consumers evaluate paradox brands more favorably and choose paradox brands more than traditional brands without contradictions. Furthermore, bicultural consumers exhibit more favorable evaluations and greater choice of paradox brands than do monocultural consumers. These cultural differences are attributable to greater cognitive flexibility found among biculturals, particularly those who adopt an acculturation strategy of integrating their different cultural identities. Greater cognitive flexibility, in turn, prompts stronger engagement with a paradox brand, which contributes to more favorable brand evaluations and choice.

Design/methodology/approach The three studies presented use experimental design with participants in a laboratory setting and members of an online participant panel. Findings Three studies demonstrate that while building abstractness by expanding a brand’s product portfolio can generate favorable brand evaluations, this positive effect is marginal compared to when the brand is imbued with human-like characteristics. Furthermore, the favorable effects on brand equity because of abstractness associated with a human-like brand image are evident in protection from brand dilution in the face of negative publicity. Research limitations/implications The findings suggest that a consideration of different forms of abstractness is key to unlocking the complexities of understanding customer-based brand equity. Practical implications This research shows that although building abstractness through a diversified product portfolio or a symbolic, human-like brand image can favorably impact customer-based brand equity (i.e. attitudes and responses to negative publicity), the former strategy has a marginal effect compared to the latter.

This occurs because of a conflict between the motivation to enjoy foods activated by a salient French identity and the utilitarian nature of nutrition information in foods – that does not belong to a French‐culture mindset. Three studies demonstrate that French (and not American) consumers with a salient cultural identity are more sensitive (i.e., perceive as riskier for their health) and evaluate more negatively foods that display (vs. not) nutrition information. Furthermore, this devaluation effect is mediated by anticipated feelings that the foods would not be enjoyable.

Evidence From Large Pharmaceutical Firms Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management , 27 (5), 1415-1432","Tyagi, Hanu",2025,"Problem definition: The drug development process has historically lacked transparency, leading to selective reporting of clinical trial results. Although clinical trial transparency aims to address this issue, increased public scrutiny may make managers more risk averse, potentially stifling novel research and development (R&D) initiatives. This raises the following question. Does transparency hinder technologically novel R&D? Methodology/results: Using data from nearly 10,000 clinical trials from 2000 to 2014, we examine how a 2005 policy to increase transparency affects drug novelty. Using a continuous difference-in-differences approach, we find that transparency prompts firms to rely more on previously used technologies (i.e., exploitative R&D) without reducing their pursuit of never-before-tested technologies (i.e., exploratory R&D). We identify negative informational spillovers as a mechanism; technology failures that are now more visible because of transparency could erode confidence in related trials, prompting firms toward familiar technologies to avoid reputational damage. Consistent with this mechanism, the impact of transparency is strongest among firms with less-diversified portfolios that are the most exposed to negative informational spillovers. Managerial implications: Our primary theoretical contribution is in demonstrating the unintended negative impact of transparency on novelty. For managers, we highlight diversification as a mitigation strategy. We urge policymakers to create incentives to support novel R&D despite transparency pressures.

However, for 29% of articles, at least part of the data set was not accessible to the reviewer. Considering all articles in our sample reduces the share of reproduced articles to 68%. These figures represent a significant increase compared with the period before the introduction of the disclosure policy, where only 12% of articles voluntarily provided replication materials, of which 55% could be (largely) reproduced.

However, the effects of such programs on provider knowledge, practice, and patient health outcomes have been inconsistent. One of the reasons for the varied effectiveness of these programs is the low and varying levels of provider engagement, which, in turn, could be because of the form and mode of content used. Tailoring instructional content could improve engagement, but it is expensive and logistically demanding to do so with traditional training Objective This study aimed to discover preferences among providers on the form (articles or videos), mode (featuring peers or experts), and length (short or long) of the instructional content; to quantify the extent to which differences in these preferences can explain variation in provider engagement with ICT-based training interventions; and to compare the power of content preferences to explain provider engagement against that of demographic variables. Methods We used data from a mobile phone–based intervention focused on improving tuberculosis diagnostic practices among 24,949 private providers from 5 specialties and 1734 cities over 1 year. Engagement time was used as the primary outcome to assess provider engagement. K-means clustering was used to segment providers based on the proportion of engagement time spent on content formats, modes, and lengths to discover their content preferences. The identified clusters were used to predict engagement time using a linear regression model. Subsequently, we compared the accuracy of the cluster-based prediction model with one based on demographic variables of providers (eg, specialty and geographic location). Results The average engagement time across all providers was 7.5 min (median 0, IQR 0-1.58). A total of 69.75% (17,401/24,949) of providers did not consume any content. The average engagement time for providers with nonzero engagement time was 24.8 min (median 4.9, IQR 2.2-10.1). We identified 4 clusters of providers with distinct preferences for form, mode, and length of content. These clusters explained a substantially higher proportion of the variation in engagement time compared with demographic variables (32.9% vs 1.0%) and yielded a more accurate prediction for the engagement time (root mean square error: 4.29 vs 5.21 and mean absolute error: 3.30 vs 4.26). Conclusions Providers participating in a mobile phone–based digital campaign have inherent preferences for instructional content. Targeting providers based on individual content preferences could result in higher provider engagement as compared to targeting providers based on demographic variables.",Crossref,100.0,10.2196/15998,https://doi.org/10.2196/15998,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,"Tyagi, H., Sabharwal, M., Dixit, N., Pal, A., & Deo, S.

This evolution began with the integration of electronic health records and has expanded to encompass a wide range of digital tools, from medical apps to wearables. These technological advancements have played a crucial role in enhancing patient experiences and outcomes. As healthcare technology has become increasingly interconnected, both physically and in the cyber realm, it has evolved into vast Health Care Information Infrastructures (HCIIs). These HCIIs are of paramount importance due to their critical role in people's well-being and safety. Any disruption, whether through direct actions like medical errors, or indirect actions such as altering patient records can have severe consequences for patient health. Currently, HCIIs are vulnerable because they often rely on isolated cybersecurity products. There is a pressing need to establish a comprehensive security strategy that can coordinate various security components to detect system vulnerabilities and sophisticated attacks. To address this complex challenge, it is essential to break down cybersecurity concerns in the healthcare sector based on the criticality of their assets. Prioritizing emerging solutions in this manner will help mitigate the complexity of the problem. Cyberattacks on the healthcare sector have become increasingly sophisticated and involve not only technical vulnerabilities but also social engineering tactics that exploit individuals with limited technical knowledge. European health and cybersecurity experts must collaborate to develop policies and standards that elevate security maturity throughout the EU. Ultimately, cybersecurity solutions in healthcare should not only enhance security but also have a positive business impact, enabling new services, collaborations, and market opportunities. The proposed solution in this study, represents a state-of-the-art approach to enhancing cybersecurity within HCIIs. It improves the detection and analysis of cyber threats and increases awareness of privacy and security risks in the digital healthcare ecosystem. By providing a Dynamic Situational Awareness Framework, the solution empowers stakeholders in the healthcare sector to recognize, model, and respond to cyber risks, including advanced persistent threats and daily cybersecurity incidents. Additionally, it facilitates the secure exchange of incident-related information aiming to strengthen the security and resilience of modern digital healthcare systems and the associated medical supply chain services. The proposed solution extends the frontiers of various research fields, including security engineering, privacy engineering, and artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from biological swarm formations, it brings together these disciplines to empower stakeholders in digital healthcare ecosystems. This leads to the creation of a highly interconnected and advanced intelligence system, comprised of simple nodes or groups of nodes, enabling local interactions and management of healthcare environments. By employing bio-inspired techniques and large-group decision-making models, the framework enhances communication and coordination in complex, distributed networks typical of interconnected healthcare infrastructures. It prioritizes scalability and fault-tolerance, allowing coordinated actions without a central coordinator. This approach streamlines investigation activities within healthcare ecosystems, fostering dynamic intelligence and collective decision-making, even when individual nodes lack a complete view of the situation.",Semantic Scholar,43.24324324324324,10.54941/ahfe1004780,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0e265e6e37b87fdb10e6d3c90fd71ebc4c4c9e4,Human Factors in Cybersecurity,"Deo, S., & Tyagi, H.

Because these joint criteria are inherently contradictory, we examine whether legally immaterial redacted information is economically material to investors. We find that firms’ stock price discovery process is significantly slower and insider trading is significantly greater after companies file redacted contracts compared to nonredacted contracts. We then examine the impact of the 2019 FAST Act, which reduced the SEC’s oversight of redacted contracts. Companies redact more frequently and insider trading (but not speed of stock price discovery) is more pronounced after the FAST Act.

We show that the introduction of these rules leads to a decrease in investment, which is more pronounced for firms with high reliance on leases. We posit and find that lease capitalization affects investment via a learning channel and a contracting channel. Regarding the first channel, we argue that managers identify areas of overinvestment and activities that should be discontinued or downsized because of the information they collect and analyze to comply with lease-capitalization rules. Accordingly, we find that the effect of lease capitalization is stronger when learning opportunities are higher. Regarding the second channel, we argue that lease capitalization affects investment via its effect on contracts. Accordingly, we document an increase in the likelihood of covenant breaches and a stronger decline in investment for financially constrained firms.

The effects of these mediating variables are much less pronounced for bank loan spreads.

In this paper, we endogenously estimate a firm's segment disclosure quality and investigate whether the quality of segment disclosures significantly affects bond investors' assessment of the co-insurance effect of diversification. We document that bonds issued by industrially diversified firms with high-quality segment disclosures have significantly lower yields than bonds issued by diversified firms with low-quality segment disclosures. We also find that the negative relation between industrial diversification and bond yields becomes stronger when firms improve segment disclosures as a result of FAS 131.

Practitioners have touted the potential for these systems to increase helping among employees. However, the extent to which employees actually use these systems to recognize their peers varies across organizations; some are used broadly by many employees across all functional, specialty, geographic, and hierarchical subgroups of the organization, whereas others are only narrowly used by some, but not all, subgroups. Across three experiments, we examine how peer-recognition systems impact employees’ propensity to ask others for help (i.e., help seeking) based on whether the system is broadly used by all subgroups or only narrowly used by specific subgroups. We predict and find that a peer-recognition system broadly used by all subgroups strengthens employees’ perception of a help-seeking norm. This perception increases employees’ propensity to seek help directly through norm conformity and indirectly by reducing the perceived psychological costs of help seeking. We also predict and find that the effect of peer-recognition systems that are narrowly used by specific subgroups is moderated by whether employees belong to the subgroups using the system; whereas it increases help-seeking propensity for members of the subgroups using the system, it decreases help-seeking propensity for nonmembers relative to when there is no peer-recognition system.

We manipulate two factors: (1) whether participants are encouraged to disclose their failed attempts at finding the shortcut to future participants and (2) whether they are evaluated for their task-related skills. We predict and find failure disclosure increases the likelihood of shortcut identification in the presence of evaluation, and this effect is mitigated in the absence of evaluation.

Yet, we know little about how this arrangement relates to worker productivity and fairness. Academic/practical relevance: We provide the first firm-based evidence that when service teams are allowed to allocate compensation internally, the ensuing peer-bargaining process can generate inequitable outcomes for women. Methodology: We demonstrate this using fixed-effect models to identify productivity and peer-bargaining traits in 932 workers at 32 large Chinese beauty salons. We measure individual productivity through service and prepaid card sales and measure bargaining through the division of team-based commissions. We also build a parsimonious bargaining model to explain our empirical results. Results: Although productivity and bargaining outcomes are positively correlated, female workers consistently receive bargaining outcomes below their productivity level, whereas men are consistently overcompensated. Importantly, we provide evidence that our results can only be explained by a combination of higher prosociality and lower bargaining power in women. We also demonstrate that the resulting inequity is positively correlated with shorter tenure. Managerial implications: Our findings provide unique organizational evidence on how bargaining among peers relates to productivity in service operations. We show that the discriminatory social dynamics observed throughout society are evident in operational designs that delegate decision rights to teams and that the magnitude in these systems is at least as large as that observed in traditional hierarchical pay systems.

In a series of experiments, we predict and find that, holding employees' outside opportunities constant, those attracted to social-mission organizations that pay below-market wages perform better individually and cooperate more effectively in teams than those attracted to social-mission organizations that pay higher wages. The individual performance effect arises because below-market pay facilitates the selection of value-congruent employees who are naturally inclined to work hard for the organizational mission. The team cooperation effect arises because employees expect team members who have selected a social-mission job that pays below market to be more value-congruent and, therefore, more cooperative than those who have selected a social-mission job that pays higher wages.

Interestingly, I also find that these effects are moderated by the Dark Triad of personalities, a group of three personality traits. My study reveals that recognition programs mainly lead individuals who score lower on the Dark Triad to increase counterproductive efforts and those who score higher on the Dark Triad to increase productive efforts.

Evidence from ICU Nurses,"Wang, Yixin Iris",forthcoming,"Employees routinely make valuable contributions at work that are not part of their formal job description, such as helping a struggling coworker. These contributions, termed organizational citizenship behavior, are studied from many angles in the organizational behavior literature. However, the degree to which the past helping behavior of employees scheduled to a shift impacts that shift’s operational outcomes remains an underexplored question. We define two measures of past helping behavior for members of a shift—the total past helping of each employee and the past helping between each pair of employees—and hypothesize that they are associated with shift performance. We empirically confirm our hypotheses with detailed scheduling and patient outcome data from six intensive care units (ICUs) at a large academic medical center, using the hospital’s electronic medical records to identify cases of one nurse helping another. Our empirical results indicate that both measures of past helping are predictive of patient length of stay (LOS), more so than the broadly studied notion of team familiarity. Counterfactual analysis shows that relatively small changes in shift composition can yield significant reduction in total LOS, indicating the managerial significance of the results.

A key conclusion in the GAO report is that when the FDA gives their most unfavorable plant inspection outcome, those plants develop shortages soon thereafter, a possible sign of onerous FDA corrective actions that may come at the cost of reliable drug supplies. We examine whether these most unfavorable FDA inspection outcomes help or hinder drug shortages, using a rigorous econometric approach. Methodology/results: We employ instrumental variable (IV) analysis to conduct a verification of this GAO report. We examine the relationship between the most unfavorable inspection outcome given by the FDA, an official action indicated (OAI), and future drug shortage risks. We find that, contrary to the GAO report, OAI inspection outcomes lead to reduced shortage risks. Robustness checks give consistent results. In posthoc analyses, we continue to leverage instrumental variable analyses to explore the impact of the other inspection outcomes, as well as merely receiving an inspection, on shortage risks. We find evidence of an incrementally beneficial relationship between inspection outcome severity and shortage risk reduction. Managerial implications: The FDA hesitates to issue OAI outcomes, doing so at an exceedingly low rate. Our results indicate that if the GAO report created any organizational hesitancy on the part of the FDA to issue OAIs out of a concern that they may lead to shortages, this hesitancy appears to be unwarranted.

However, in practice, managers may be prone to behavioral biases that can lead to suboptimal decisions. This paper investigates the effectiveness of discretionary pricing and behavioral elements on pricing decisions via field and lab experiments. Collaborating with a pharmacy chain retailer, we first analyzed a field experiment that delegated pricing authority to store managers. We find that managers began engaging in discretionary pricing after two months of experiment implementation and tended to raise the prices of high-priced drugs, resulting in significant sales and revenue losses. This effect was particularly prominent among less-experienced managers and in low-competition stores. We further designed a set of lab experiments to generalize our field observations and explore possible behavioral drivers. We requested lab participants to make pricing decisions under different information display scenarios and compared the average price adjustments between the direct display and click-to-view designs. We observe that participants also tended to raise product prices, and the magnitude of elevation was higher in the click-to-view group where the demand function information is less salient and accessible. Follow-up lab experiments support our field observations, suggesting that experience through repeated decisions and real-time feedback could alleviate the bias effect. Additionally, participants focused on high-priced products when given a list of items for discretionary pricing. Our results highlight the need to consider behavioral biases in human–algorithm collaborations and provide practical insights for improving information provision and training in discretionary settings.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/10591478241248747,https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241248747,Production and Operations Management,"Liang, X., Wang, Y., & Li, J.

In this paper, we develop a structural model to capture the multiple determinants governing manufacturers’ entry decisions; in particular, we focus on how manufacturing complexity and the regulatory environment for generics approval affect concentration in drug markets. We estimate the model using data collated from six disparate sources. We find that manufacturing complexity, as reflected in the number of active ingredients, for example, significantly reduces the likelihood of generics entry. Moreover, the delay in the review process for the generics applications significantly affects the number of firms entering a market. Our policy simulations suggest that a shortened drug approval review time significantly increases the average number of entrants per market and reduces the fraction of markets with no generics entry; however, a notable portion of markets would still lack any generic competition.

We first document a baseline fact: a significant proportion of tier-2 suppliers are shared by tier-1 suppliers. We then construct two simple metrics to capture the degree of tier-2 sharing and disentangle its effect from tier-2 suppliers’ own risks. We show that the focal firms’ risk levels are significantly related to the proportion of shared tier-2 suppliers in their supply network, and the effect becomes monotonically stronger as their tier-2 suppliers become more highly shared. Finally, we uncover causal relationships behind these associations using a new source of exogenous, idiosyncratic risk events in an event study setting. We show that, as tier-2 suppliers are impacted by these events, focal firms experience negative abnormal returns, the magnitude of which is significantly larger when the impacted tier-2 suppliers are more heavily shared. Overall, our study uncovers the subtier network structure as an important risk source for the focal firm, with the degree of tier-2 sharing as the main moderator. Our results also provide the microfoundation for a common structure in idiosyncratic risks and suggest the importance of incorporating the effect of subtier supply network structure in the portfolio-optimization process.

Study 1 demonstrated that financial self-efficacy mediated the association between SES and MIL following a prime of gaining money.

However, as we show in our second experiment, under group incentives, structuring a tangible reward as a shared experience among group members who like each other can mitigate any demotivating effect of an individually consumed tangible reward vis‐à‐vis a cash reward. A third experiment provides process support for our theory, showing that both the attractiveness of the reward and the degree of certainty that others will also find it attractive jointly and fully mediate our findings. As a whole, our study furthers an understanding of the multifaceted dimensions of tangible rewards, identifying incremental effects that can arise when tangible rewards are combined with group incentives.",Crossref,95.0,10.1111/1911-3846.12844,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12844,Contemporary Accounting Research,"Kachelmeier, S., Williamson, M., & Zhang, X.

Specifically, we predict and find that female (male) job candidates who exhibit stereotypically male behaviors receive lower (higher) evaluations during group recruiting events, particularly among male recruiters. Prior research suggests gender stereotypes do not bias employee selection during one‐on‐one interviews. However, our results suggest that evaluating job candidates in the more social context of group events can have important unintended consequences on employee selection, a key component of the accounting control environment. Given the importance of group recruiting events to inform hiring decisions across organizations such as investment banks and public accounting firms, our results contribute to a better understanding of survey and field evidence suggesting that entry‐level male and female employees have different personalities at these organizations, which appear to influence their career trajectories.",Crossref,99.27007299270073,10.1111/1911-3846.12710,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12710,Contemporary Accounting Research,"Fanning, K., Williams, J., & Williamson, M.

Using a stark laboratory experiment, we find support for theory suggesting that individuals believe that their knowledge is an important part of their identity, making it costly to share, but facilitating greater trust that recipients of this knowledge will reciprocate with future rewards. Utilizing participants with substantial work experience, results from additional scenario-based experiments demonstrate practical implications of this theory. Collectively, the results from our experiments show that individuals help others less when the help conveys personal knowledge relative to when it does not absent the prospect of rewards, but more when they can expect future rewards (i.e., with implicit incentives). Importantly, knowledge sharing increases the efficacy of implicit incentives more when they are determined by the help recipient relative to someone else (e.g., a supervisor). Collectively, we contribute to a better understanding of incentive systems designed to promote knowledge sharing in practice.",Semantic Scholar,83.22981366459628,10.2139/ssrn.2648298,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cabea2a62fde25b6f3fe5e9b250a58e0dfcf3b3,"Accounting, Organizations and Society","Haesebrouck, K., Van den Abbeele, A., & Williamson, M.

The defining characteristic of both experiments is a second-stage task that is separated in time from the first-stage implementation of different incentive schemes. In Experiment 1, the second stage takes place ten days after we implement conditions with quantity incentives, high-creativity incentives, incentives with a minimum-creativity threshold, and a fixed-pay control condition. In Experiment 2, we test the effects of incentives with an incubation period of 20 minutes, during which an experimenter escorts participants on a walk between compensated work periods. In both experiments, we find that participants with quantity incentives outperform the high-creativity production of their fixed-pay counterparts only in the second-stage task. Mediation analyses suggest that quantity-incentivized participants' propensity to try more divergent ideas in the first stage sparks their creativity advantage in the second stage.

In the absence of the value statement, participants with piece‐rate rewards for correct responses generate more correct and incorrect responses than do their counterparts with fixed pay, correcting errors as they go along to maximize compensation. Essentially, piece‐rate compensation acts as an output control, incentivizing participants to maximize correct responses through a “produce‐and‐improve” strategy. The value statement suppresses this strategy because participants appear to perceive it as an input constraint, prompting greater initial care at the expense of lower overall productivity. As a result, the value statement eliminates the gains in correct responses that piece‐rate incentivized participants otherwise realize. Thus, in settings in which individuals can gain efficiency by working expeditiously and improving quality when necessary, our results suggest the possibility that organizations could be better off just letting incentive schemes operate, rather than emphasizing quality in ways that could overly constrain productivity.",Crossref,99.4475138121547,10.1111/1911-3846.12147,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12147,Contemporary Accounting Research,"Kachelmeier, S., Thornock, T., & Williamson, M.

Using a laboratory experiment where participants make choices from a payoff matrix representing target and effort levels, we model a setting where employee-participants have economic incentives to respond to higher target assignments by superior-participants with higher effort. However, reciprocity could lead employees to reward low target assignments with high effort and punish high target assignments with low effort. In a single-interaction setting where only innate preferences can drive reciprocal behavior, we find that superiors select higher targets and that employees generally respond with higher effort. In a repeated-interaction setting where reciprocal behavior can emerge for strategic reasons, we find that superiors set lower targets and that employees generally respond to low targets with high effort and to high targets with low effort. Collectively, our results suggest that reciprocity plays a limited role in affecting target and effort levels in a single-interaction setting. Rather, reciprocity appears to emerge for more strategic reasons brought on by repeated interactions. As most work relationships extend over multiple periods, our results may help explain why organizations tend to set readily achievable performance targets.",Crossref,99.46524064171123,10.2308/jmar-51089,https://doi.org/10.2308/jmar-51089,Journal of Management Accounting Research,"Fisher, J., Peffer, S., Sprinkle, G., & Williamson, M.

We use a laboratory experiment to demonstrate that individuals with higher levels of dispositional optimism are more likely to choose compensation that is contingent on a company's future stock price than to choose fixed pay, even after controlling for the individual's risk preferences. Furthermore, compared to participants selecting fixed pay, those selecting stock-based compensation also perform better on a challenging problem-solving task, a result that we show is due to their higher levels of dispositional optimism. Collectively, we demonstrate that stock-based compensation can have productivity-enhancing effects, even if stock prices are completely insensitive to individual efforts.

Exploring this novel phenomenon with both field studies and lab experiments, the current research shows that experiencing art reduces consumer desire for luxury goods. Three boundary conditions have been identified. The effect does not materialize in contexts in which the work of art is not experienced as art per se, such as when the work of art appears as decoration on the product or packaging or is processed analytically rather than naturally, and when luxury goods are not seen as status goods. We propose that experiencing art induces a mental state of self-transcendence, which undermines consumers’ status-seeking motive and consequently decreases their desire for luxury goods.

The authors investigate whether, how, why, and when the order of rating and tipping affects both consumer behaviors in seven studies, including one quasi-field experiment, one archival data analysis, one randomized field experiment, and four randomized lab experiments. They show that asking customers to rate a service professional before tipping negatively impacts the tip amount but that tipping first does not affect subsequent rating scores. The authors propose that the negative effect of rating on tipping occurs because, when rating a service professional first, customers categorize their feedback as a reward for the service professional, which partially alleviates the felt obligation to tip, resulting in a smaller tip. This negative effect is more evident when customers (1) tip from their own pocket, (2) have higher categorization flexibility, or (3) perceive that the service professional benefits from the rating. Moreover, highlighting the consistency motivation after rating but before tipping can attenuate this effect.

Our approach yields a formalized, scale-free, and interpretable measure of deterrence motives that informs researchers about the proportion for which deterrence motives account of all entry motives. In addition, the decomposition leads to a set of conditions for counterfactual analysis where hypothetical scenarios with deterrence motives eliminated can be explored. We illustrate the use of our measure and counterfactual by conducting an empirical case study about the dynamics of coffee chain stores in Toronto, Canada. The inferred deterrence motives suggest that a noticeable proportion of entry motives can be attributed to deterrence; it can be as high as 43% for the increasingly dominant coffee chain, Starbucks, in certain types of markets. Finally, counterfactual analysis confirms that deterrence motives are indeed associated with Starbucks’ aggressive presence as the number of its outlets and its market share are markedly lower once these motives are eliminated.

We infer the impact of product shortages on sales in neighboring outlets using unique data from a large fast fashion retailing chain and an Instrumented Difference‐in‐Differences (DDIV) methodology. Our analysis reveals that sales for a particular item at a focal store increases when that same item experiences stock‐outs in neighboring stores. Our empirical findings suggest that there is substitutability across stores, and that this substitutability is the strongest in the period when the stock‐out is observed for the first time, and decreases as time passes following the stock‐out.

Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether consistent users of these apps succeed in achieving their weight goals. This study used data from an mHealth app that enabled tracking of caloric intake, body weight, and physical activity and provided a caloric budget depending on weight goal. The primary objective was to evaluate adherence to caloric budget and body weight change among the most consistent (i.e., daily) trackers of caloric intake over a calendar year ( n = 9372, 50% male). Methods Gender‐stratified linear mixed models were conducted to examine the effects of quarter of year (Q1–Q4 as season proxies) and body mass index (BMI) group (normal weight, overweight, obesity) on adherence to a caloric budget (kcal/day). Change in body weight was analyzed using a subset of users ( n = 5808) who entered their weight in the app at least once per week, once per month, or once in Q1 and Q4.

The authors examine whether strategic considerations in entry and expansion play a role in organizational-form decisions (e.g., franchising) in retailing. The authors utilize store count and revenues for franchised and company-owned outlets of nationwide convenience store chains in 47 geographical markets in Japan between 1984 and 2010. The empirical analyses show that strategic considerations in entry and expansion, ignored in the literature on franchising, appear to influence an organizational-form decision: firms rely more on company-owned outlets for expansion when the threat of entry from competitor firms in adjacent markets increases. The authors examine two interpretations: the convenience of quick deployment and a credible signal. Numerical analyses of a simple dynamic model of entry and franchising confirm that company-owned-outlet-based expansion arises under heightened entry threat.

Modeling firm size is important because retail chain dynamics are more richly driven by expansion and contraction than de novo entry or permanent exit. Additionally, anticipated size spillovers may influence the strategies of forward-looking firms, making it difficult to analyze the effects of size without explicitly accounting for these in the expectations and, hence, decisions of firms. Expansion may also be profitable for some firms while detrimental for others. Thus, we explicitly model and allow for heterogeneity in the dynamic link between firm size and profits as well as potential for persistent brand effects through firm-specific unobservable factors. As a methodological contribution, we surmount the hurdle of estimating the model by extending a two-step procedure that circumvents solving the game. The first stage combines semiparametric conditional choice probability estimation with a particle filter to eliminate the serially correlated unobservable components. The second stage uses a forward simulation approach to estimate the payoff parameters. Data on Canadian hamburger chains from their inception in 1970 to 2005 provide evidence of firm-specific heterogeneity in brand effects, size spillovers, and persistence in profitability.

When dealing with realistic threats associated with potential economic losses in a host country, however, MNEs are adaptive, decreasing the tendency to transfer parent-country nationals abroad and increasing the use of host-country nationals in foreign subsidiaries. The two threats interact in affecting staffing decisions. Moreover, industry globalization moderates asymmetrically the influences of the two threats: globalization strengthens the effect of symbolic threats but weakens the effect of realistic threats.

A Micro-Foundations Perspective on Firm Absorptive Capacity,"Yao, Fiona Kun",2017,"Research summary : In this study, we build on the micro‐foundations perspective and investigate how individual characteristics contribute to the development of firm absorptive capacity. In particular, we assess how individual learning goal orientation affects firm potential and realized absorptive capacity. Furthermore, we study how individuals' civic virtue acts as a micro‐level social integration mechanism that moderates the effect from firm realized absorptive capacity to potential absorptive capacity. Using the multilevel structural equation modeling technique and data from 871 core‐knowledge employees nested in 139 high‐technology firms, we find support to our major hypotheses. Together, this study finds support for the micro‐foundations' perspective and generates novel insights on how individual‐level factors could be linked with firm‐level heterogeneity in absorptive capacity . Managerial summary : We study how employees' characteristics contribute to a firm's absorptive capacity, that is, the ability of a firm to identify, assimilate, and exploit knowledge from the environment. Because firms have increasingly tapped into external resources to foster innovation over the past two decades, absorptive capacity is crucial to firm learning and success. Using data from 871 core‐knowledge employees in 139 high‐technology firms, we find that individual employees' learning goal orientation, the tendency to seek improvements in employees' competence and to understand or master new things advances the development of a firm's potential and realized absorptive capacity. More important, individual employees' civic virtue, the discretionary involvement in company issues, serves as a social integration mechanism that reduces the gap between firm potential and realized absorptive capacity .

The ways in which internet users perceive and respond to such surveillance across overlapping contexts warrants deeper exploration. This study delves into the acceptance of digital surveillance by internet users and their subsequent self-protective actions against it in three distinct contexts: government, commercial, and interpersonal surveillance. Survey responses collected from 356 internet users in the U.S. showed that acceptance levels for surveillance varied between institutional and interpersonal contexts. However, the degree of self-protection remained consistent across all three contexts. Privacy concerns, algorithm awareness, and perceived privacy control played nuanced roles to both surveillance acceptance and self-protection measures in each context. Interestingly, political orientation emerged as a significant moderating factor on surveillance acceptance. Conservative-leaning participants were less accepting of surveillance overall, especially government surveillance. For conservatives, higher privacy concerns meant less acceptance of both government and corporate surveillance. Liberals’ acceptance levels remained fairly consistent and were less affected by privacy concerns.

In Study 1, college students viewed a real estate property tour in virtual reality (VR; high immersion) or as a 360° video (low immersion) in a research lab. The tour was accompanied by a voiceover presenting descriptive information about the apartment (descriptive evidence) or a narrative‐based introduction (narrative evidence). We found the enhanced telepresence under the VR viewing condition negatively impacted users' memory of the property; this effect was particularly pronounced with the narrative voiceover. Study 2 replicated key findings from Study 1 in an online experiment with a larger and more diverse sample. We also found that narrative‐induced transportation strengthened attitudinal outcomes, and enhanced telepresence boosted this effect. Our studies disentangle the impacts of VR‐induced telepresence on cognitive processing from the effects of narrative‐induced transportation on persuasive outcomes. The highly immersive media experience combined with deep transportation into the narrative can strengthen viewers' positive attitude towards the overall experience but hinder their ability to remember the details of the content.

To fill this gap, our research investigates consumer perceptions of a branded VR experience of a university campus tour under different viewing conditions across two studies. In Study 1, we interviewed 17 participants who experienced the VR tour on Oculus Rift CV1. Emerging themes from the data revealed a sense of telepresence, enjoyment, and appreciation for going places not available to participants in real life. Study 2 employed an experimental design where participants viewed the same content using one of the three VR devices that varied in system immersion (smartphone, Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift DK2). Telepresence and its impact on recall and persuasion were measured. Results show that all three viewing conditions had equal capacity to create a sense of telepresence.

In Study 1, we conducted a pre–post treatment between-subject field experiment (smartphone vs. VR) among 58 seniors (aged 60 years and above) in a community center in Beijing, China. One-on-one semistructured interviews of each participant were conducted after the experiment. In Study 2, we conducted a between-subject laboratory experiment with the same design among college students. The results show that while both VR and smartphone viewing conditions led to a significant positive effect on the self-reported emotions of the college students, only the smartphone viewing condition had a significant impact on the emotional well-being of the elderly participants. For college students, immersive VR had a stronger effect on inducing positive emotions than smartphone, but for elderly people, the smartphone viewing condition was more effective in improving emotional wellbeing than immersive VR.

Drawing from prior research on meaning-making and self-reflection, we predicted that cueing participants to reconstrue their experience in ways that lead them to focus on it from a broader perspective during a conversation would buffer them against negative affect and enhance their sense of closure compared with cueing them to recount the emotionally arousing details concerning what happened. Results supported this prediction. Content analyses additionally revealed that participants in the reconstrue condition used the word ""you"" generically (e.g., you cannot always get what you want) more than participants in the recount condition, identifying a linguistic mechanism that supports reconstrual.

However, a growing number of studies shows that receiving support can undermine goal-pursuit. Addressing this paradox, we investigated a novel idea of the effects of how people think about their social support on their goal-pursuit. Four experiments showed that participants who were led to think abstractly (vs. concretely) about their social support showed higher intent to pursue their goal (Studies 1-3) and worked harder toward their goal (Study 4). The benefits of abstracting one’s social support occurred over a variety of personal goals, support types, and support-providers, indicating the generalizability and robustness of our findings. These results demonstrate that how people think about their social support influences goal-pursuit and suggest ways in which support-recipients can maximize their social support.",Semantic Scholar,94.1558441558442,10.38007/proceedings.0000269,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ab7f0c14e89eee45769448f7e79e711a14570ba,,"Ybarra, O.

A critical review,"Ybarra, Oscar",2017,"Social network sites are ubiquitous and now constitute a common tool people use to interact with one another in daily life. Here we review the consequences of interacting with social network sites for subjective well‐being—that is, how people feel moment‐to‐moment and how satisfied they are with their lives. We begin by clarifying the constructs that we focus on in this review: social network sites and subjective well‐being. Next, we review the literature that explains how these constructs are related. This research reveals: (a) negative relationships between passively using social network sites and subjective well‐being, and (b) positive relationships between actively using social network sites and subjective well‐being, with the former relationship being more robust than the latter. Specifically, passively using social network sites provokes social comparisons and envy, which have negative downstream consequences for subjective well‐being. In contrast, when active usage of social network sites predicts subjective well‐being, it seems to do so by creating social capital and stimulating feelings of social connectedness. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of this work.",Crossref,87.57396449704142,10.1111/sipr.12033,https://doi.org/10.1111/sipr.12033,Social Issues and Policy Review,"Ybarra, O. (2017).

Moreover, feelings of self-confidence from thinking about a supportive (vs. nonsupportive) other mediated personal growth. Extending these results, Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that people’s perceptions of how supportive their close others are predicted personal growth in two distinct cultures with varying emphasis on individual (vs. collective) growth.

To achieve positive interaction outcomes, individuals may engage in a social perception process that leads them to believe they have obtained more information about others than these others gained about them. We investigate how asymmetric knowledge perceptions contribute to important aspects of negotiation, namely rapport building among strangers and egocentric beliefs about fairness of resource distribution. In Study 1, dyads completed measures of knowledge acquisition and partner evaluation after a rapport‐building exercise. Results showed that individuals believed they gained more information about their partner than vice versa; notably, the magnitude of this knowledge bias was associated with more positive partner evaluations. Study 2 showed that the magnitude of the knowledge bias predicted lower egocentrism in a commons dilemma task. Together, these results suggest knowledge asymmetries facilitate rapport among strangers and may have important implications for cooperation in competitive negotiation settings.",Crossref,82.4742268041237,10.1111/ncmr.12047,https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12047,Negotiation and Conflict Management Research,"Ybarra, O.

Different theoretical perspectives can inform how intergroup threat should affect memory for threat-relevant and neutral information, such as the mood-congruency approach, Yerkes–Dodson law, Easterbrook’s theory, and also evolutionary perspectives. To test among these, we conducted two experiments to examine how exposure to intergroup threats affected memory compared to control conditions. In study 1, we manipulated symbolic threat and examined participants’ memory for threat and neutral words. In study 2, memory performance was assessed following the induction of realistic threat. Across the studies, in the control condition participants showed better memory for threat-related than neutral information. However, participants under threat remembered neutral information as well as threat-related information. In addition, participants in the threat condition remembered threat-related information as well as participants in the control condition. The findings are discussed in terms of automatic vigilance processes but also the effects of threat on arousal and its effect on information processing.

However, distinguishing early signs of MCI from normal cognitive aging is difficult. Biomarkers have been extensively examined as early indicators of the pathological process for AD, but assessing these biomarkers is expensive and challenging to apply widely among pre-symptomatic community dwelling older adults. Here we propose assessment of social markers, which could provide an alternative or complementary and ecologically valid strategy for identifying the pre-symptomatic phase leading to MCI and AD. Methods: The data came from a larger randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT), where we examined whether daily conversational interactions using remote video telecommunications software could improve cognitive functions of older adult participants. We assessed the proportion of words generated by participants out of total words produced by both participants and staff interviewers using transcribed conversations during the intervention trial as an indicator of how two people (participants and interviewers) interact with each other in one-on-one conversations. We examined whether the proportion differed between those with intact cognition and MCI, using first, generalized estimating equations with the proportion as outcome, and second, logistic regression models with cognitive status as outcome in order to estimate the area under ROC curve (ROC AUC). Results: Compared to those with normal cognitive function, MCI participants generated a greater proportion of words out of the total number of words during the timed conversation sessions (p=0.01). This difference remained after controlling for participant age, gender, interviewer and time of assessment (p=0.03). The logistic regression models showed the ROC AUC of identifying MCI (vs. normals) was 0.71 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.54 – 0.89) when average proportion of word counts spoken by subjects was included univariately into the model. Conclusion: An ecologically valid social marker such as the proportion of spoken words produced during spontaneous conversations may be sensitive to transitions from normal cognition to MCI.",Semantic Scholar ,90.72164948453609,10.2174/1567205012666150530201917,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ece4ee8f470b0b6554835556cfe70c2ffaa9a70c,Current Alzheimer Research,"Ybarra, O.

We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation‐based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user‐friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30‐minute face‐to‐face communications were conducted during a 6‐week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass‐mailing invitations. The pre‐ to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty‐three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%–100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test ( P = .003) at the post‐trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test ( P = .004) at the 18‐week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend ( P = .04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user‐friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language‐based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost‐effective home‐based prevention methods.

In this paper, we propose a collaborative airspace sensing strategy auSense to improve the sensing performance. In auSense, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are employed to sense the airspace when the airspace is not sensed by airplanes. Particularly, auSense leverages the existing worldwide commercial airplane tracking infrastructure and fine-grained trajectory data to estimate whether and when one airspace will be sensed by airplanes. Then auSense schedules the UAV paths to improve the sensing performance. We implement auSense in different airspaces based on a 1-month airplane trajectory data.

We demonstrate that this architecture not only achieves energy savings but also guarantees the data accuracy specified by the application. Furthermore, based on this architecture, we propose two implementations. The experimental results show that both implementations can raise the energy savings while keeping the error at an predefined and acceptable level.

The review covers definitions and expositions of commonly used machine learning methods, and historical trends of their use in psychiatry. We also provide a set of standards, namely Guidelines for REporting Machine Learning Investigations in Neuropsychiatry (GREMLIN), for designing and reporting studies that use machine learning as a primary data-analysis approach. Lastly, we propose the establishment of the Machine Learning in Psychiatry (MLPsych) Consortium, enumerate its objectives, and identify areas of opportunity for future applications of machine learning in biological psychiatry. This review serves as a cautiously optimistic primer on machine learning for those on the precipice as they prepare to dive into the field, either as methodological practitioners or well-informed consumers.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02334-2,"TP Quinn, JL Hess, VS Marshe, MM Barnett… - Molecular …, 2024 - nature.com",,Goal 4,0.04817956535534364,False,

Identification of common genetic variants associated with susceptibility to radiotoxicity might improve risk prediction and inform functional mechanistic studies. Methods We conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis of six genome-wide association studies (n = 3871) in men of European ancestry who underwent radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Radiotoxicities (increased urinary frequency, decreased urinary stream, hematuria, rectal bleeding) were graded prospectively. We used grouped relative risk models to test associations with approximately 6 million genotyped or imputed variants (time to first grade 2 or higher toxicity event). Variants with two-sided Pmeta less than 5 × 10−8 were considered statistically significant. Bayesian false discovery probability provided an additional measure of confidence. Statistically significant variants were evaluated in three Japanese cohorts (n = 962). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Meta-analysis of the European ancestry cohorts identified three genomic signals: single nucleotide polymorphism rs17055178 with rectal bleeding (Pmeta = 6.2 × 10−10), rs10969913 with decreased urinary stream (Pmeta = 2.9 × 10−10), and rs11122573 with hematuria (Pmeta = 1.8 × 10−8). Fine-scale mapping of these three regions was used to identify another independent signal (rs147121532) associated with hematuria (Pconditional = 4.7 × 10−6). Credible causal variants at these four signals lie in gene-regulatory regions, some modulating expression of nearby genes. Previously identified variants showed consistent associations (rs17599026 with increased urinary frequency, rs7720298 with decreased urinary stream, rs1801516 with overall toxicity) in new cohorts. rs10969913 and rs17599026 had similar effects in the photon-treated Japanese cohorts. Conclusions This study increases the understanding of the architecture of common genetic variants affecting radiotoxicity, points to novel radio-pathogenic mechanisms, and develops risk models for testing in clinical studies. Further multinational radiogenomics studies in larger cohorts are worthwhile.",Crossref,92.6829268292683,10.1093/jnci/djz075,https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djz075,JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute,,Goal 17,0.005908345306101137,False,

Contemporary Accounting,"Beardsley, Erik",2021,"This study investigates how sophisticated market participants use tax-based information by examining whether analysts’ street effective tax rates (ETRs) are informative. When forecasting and assessing firm performance, analysts often exclude certain items they believe do not reflect current performance, resulting in “street” metrics such as street ETR. Using a hand-collected sample of analyst reports, we find that approximately 35 percent of street ETRs have at least one tax-specific exclusion, and over 90 percent have tax effects of pre-tax exclusions. Consistent with analysts’ understanding the implications of tax and non-tax exclusions, our results suggest that street ETRs are more informative than GAAP ETRs. We investigate variation in analysts’ ETR exclusions and find that ETR exclusions are of higher quality when the magnitude of the potential excluded item is greater and when managers disclose pro forma earnings. These results provide a nuanced view of the extent that analysts incorporate tax-based information into their assessment of firm performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that analysts understand taxes, but selectively exert effort to understand and incorporate tax-based information into their assessment of firm performance.",Semantic Scholar ,94.01709401709402,10.2139/ssrn.3555795,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09c3c9cc04ec952c80926e6877457fd32bfed1ab,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Goal 1,0.009399973719990814,False,

Environmental innovation is operationalized using the environmental innovation score published in Refinitiv Eikon, and the gender diversity of the board and effectiveness of the audit committee are proxied using published corporate governance measures. The empirical findings reveal a strong, positive association between female representation on the board and the participation of the firm in eco-innovative activities.

Kat",2021,"ABSTRACT Community benefits agreements (CBAs) allow coalitions of labor and grassroots organizations to negotiate for concessions in the development process. One goal of a CBA is to more broadly distribute the benefits of new development to distressed communities and historically disenfranchised groups. Since their emergence in the 1990s, CBAs have not been well institutionalized. To date, there have been roughly 30 CBAs adopted across the United States. A relatively new development in the CBA movement has been the push to adopt model CBAs and community benefits ordinances, that outline all of the linkages that local government expects a developer to include in a project and require developers to negotiate linked development agreements as part of the project approval process. Although the emergence of model CBAs and CBA ordinances is promising for local groups interested in promoting equitable development, little research has been done on them.

This study aimed to fill this research gap by investigating the moderating roles of network centrality (including buyer centrality and supplier centrality) and diversity management in shaping the relation between BGD and corporate philanthropy within a supply network context in Japan.
 
 
 
 The study analyzed 2,346 matched pairs of publicly listed firms and their business partners (covering both upstream and downstream ties) across various industries in Japan. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to investigate the linkage between BGD and corporate philanthropy, along with the moderating effects of buyer centrality, supplier centrality, and diversity management.
 
 
 
 The results showed that buyer centrality facilitated the positive impact of BGD on corporate philanthropy. Conversely, supplier centrality did not significantly affect this relationship. This indicates that the influence of BGD at the supplier level may differ from that at the buyer level. This highlights the need to consider contextual factors beyond BGD when analyzing corporate philanthropy. Additionally, diversity management was found to positively moderate the relationship between BGD and corporate philanthropy.
 
 
 
 This study was among the pioneering efforts to apply reciprocity theory to develop a conceptual framework that enriched the understanding of the mechanisms underlying operational and relational governance in buyer–supplier relationships and their influence on corporate philanthropy commitment.

Advocacy for enhanced childhood cancer research and care in Canada by patients, families and the academic community led to a $23M investment through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to establish a national pediatric cancer consortium (termed ‘ACCESS’). ACCESS’ mission is to ensure every child with cancer in Canada has access to the latest scientific advances, diagnostic tools, therapies, and supportive care leading to better outcomes and quality of life. ACCESS is a unique collective of scientists, healthcare providers, industry leaders, partner organizations, advocates, patients, and their families who are conducting research, changing policy, and developing new tools to ensure better lives for children who experience cancer in Canada and for their loved ones.
 The goal is to implement transformative change in the delivery of fair, fast, effective, and safe cancer care for all children. ACCESS is driven and led by people with lived experience of pediatric cancer and framed by the patient journey. In its first year, ACCESS has unified a national community. It has: connected a community of more than 700 people and stimulated a culture of open communication in which diverse viewpoints, including those of people with lived experience of cancer, are sought and valued; built productive and effective partnerships to connect and leverage the work of organizations working to improve childhood cancer; initiated 20 new innovative pan-Canadian research studies that impact all aspects of the patient journey, including new Canadian-led clinical trials; developed an educational hub for all ACCESS members, and produced accessible communications materials such as webinars, a newsletter and a comprehensive website; developed national best practice standards and tools for research and care; started to address the complex policy, regulatory and practical barriers that prevent equitable access to cancer diagnosis and treatment for all children in Canada.Future priorities include development of a national data system for pediatric cancer, modernizing pediatric clinical trials to reduce barriers to participation in Canada, and the development of a national strategy for pediatric cancer.

We test for the existence and importance of such spillovers by analyzing whether social influence affects consumers’ perceptions of the security of payment instruments. Based on a 2008–2014 annual panel data survey of consumers, we find strong evidence of social spillovers in payment markets: others’ perceptions of security of payment instruments exert a positive influence on one’s own payment security perceptions. The significant and robust results imply that a consumer’s assessments of security converge to his peers’ average assessment: a 10 percent change in the divergence between one’s own security rating and peers’ average rating will result in a 7 percent change in one’s own rating in the next period. The results are robust to many specifications and do not change when we control for actual fraud or crime data. Our results indicate that spillovers rather than reflection appear to be the cause, although separating the two causes is very difficult (Manski ). In particular, the spillovers are stronger for people who experience an exogenous shock to security perception, people who have more social interactions, and younger consumers, who are more likely to be influenced by social media. We also examine the effects of social spillovers on payment behavior (that is, on decisions regarding payment adoption and use). Our results indicate that social spillovers have a rather limited impact on payment behavior, as others’ perceptions seem to affect one’s own payment behavior mainly indirectly through the effect on one’s own perceptions.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.86046511627907,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10693-017-0270-9,"CM Kahn, JM Liñares-Zegarra, J Stavins - Journal of Financial Services …, 2017 - Springer",,Goal 1,0.04474101782006348,False,

Emission intensity (kgCO2e/bbl) is the best measure for monitoring and reporting emissions of an oil and gas field. In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive and practical bottom-up approach to calculate the carbon emissions per barrel in a field. We identify all major sources of emissions, quantify their contributions to the field's overall carbon footprint, and discuss technologies to reduce the field's emission intensity.
 This methodology quantifies emissions across the field development lifecycle. The analysis considers Scope 1 and 2 emissions, excluding embodied carbon products and services, and was conducted in an onshore oil producer brownfield, encompassing drilling and workover campaign, surface facilities expansion, and waterflooding operations. A detailed inventory of wellsites, wells, and equipment was considered, along with rig specifications, construction activities and energy matrix. Emissions were quantified using operational data from surface equipment, logistics, and methane monitoring technologies, and aggregated at the field level to benchmark the current carbon footprint. The emissions allocation was: energy consumption (58%), venting (6%) and flaring (36%).
 Energy consumption emerged as the primary contributor to emissions, accounting for 58% of total emissions, with 71% from wells, 5% from processing, and 15% from water injection facilities. Emissions reduction can be achieved through operational efficiency (5% potential reduction), energy efficiency (5-15% potential reduction), and transitioning to cleaner energy sources. Operational efficiency involves improving field practices and adopting autonomous operations to enhance equipment reliability. Energy efficiency focuses on replacing equipment with low-energy consumption alternatives, particularly artificial lift systems and water injection pumps. Cleaner energy utilization involves integrating wellsites with the local grid to reduce diesel dependency. Venting and flaring were identified as significant contributors, with potential reductions by transporting and using associated gas for power generation. Changes in operational philosophy are necessary to transition from single-phase to multiphase flow systems. Gas monetization presents an opportunity to reduce emissions and generate revenue by producing energy for grid use. Implementing efficient artificial lift systems, improving operational practices, and utilizing associated gas for power generation can reduce the carbon footprint by at least 20% without additional costs. The overall impact depends on scalability and expansion of these solutions within the field.
 This paper proposes a novel bottom-up approach for accurately quantifying emissions and setting a carbon intensity per barrel benchmark at asset or field level using existing operational data. This method facilitates data aggregation from field to corporate level and enables the transformation of corporate decarbonization strategies into actionable plans. Integrating emissions management into routine operations empowers teams to achieve significant emissions reductions and operational improvements at minimal cost while upskilling current professionals.",Semantic Scholar,36.48648648648648,10.2118/229090-ms,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ce1c8438bfd65f7daa1086de4ac3279f1d3d5f1,ADIPEC,,Goal 7,0.2284566706583157,True,carbon emissions; clean energy infrastructure; clean energy investment; clean energy technologies; energy efficiency; energy efficiency improvement; energy-related emissions; greenhouse gas emissions

The momentum to apply the qaulan layyina communication principles to bureaucrats in the North Sumatra Provincial Government was mainly conveyed at PHBI events or moments that were agreed upon for the delivery of opinions. Media that are appropriate for use for the application of the qaulan layyina communication principle to the bureaucracy in Pemprovsu are print, electronic and online media with 2 categories, namely those registered with the North Sumatra Diskominfo and those that are not registered. Communicators who should use the qaulan layyina principle are all partners both inside and outside the government. It's just that it remains within the corridor of the existing rules by referring to the communication principles that are generally used and the journalistic code of ethics. The results of the study show that the momentum of applying the qaulan layyina communication principle is something that should be implemented through a transparent and realistic process.",Semantic Scholar,43.07692307692308,10.19109/wardah.v24i1.15378,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b1698e4ff66a3e62ad3ecdd658dc8a655cc8bf6,Wardah,,Goal 17,0.01812070839874293,False,

It spread rapidly and relentlessly, inflicting great harm. Governments were unprepared to deal with it. Health care workers had to learn how to treat patients on the fly, devoting countless hours to care and putting themselves at risk. Schools and businesses closed, and most of the world found itself under lockdowns and other types of restrictions. Uncertainty loomed. How many people would get sick and die? What would the effects be on the economy? How far behind would our children fall in their education and social skill development? How long would it take to find a cure or a vaccine? Fortunately, with respect to the last question, the scientific research enterprise was up to the task. Scientists who had been studying coronaviruses quickly redoubled their efforts, and hundreds of other virologists spun up efforts to understand this virus. Wise investments in basic research over prior decades meant that there was a wealth of knowledge on the shelf that could be used to develop vaccines rapidly (1). Companies that were developing new technologies accelerated their efforts to produce effective vaccines. Within a year, an amazing time frame that we think few scientists would have predicted, we began to immunize the population and drive down the incidence of serious illness and death. Parallel efforts led to the rapid development of monoclonal antibody therapies and small-molecule antiviral agents. Rapid diagnostic tests were developed, and we went from relying on relatively slow nucleic acid amplification methods that took days in the early days of the pandemic to home tests that provide a result in minutes. Virologists and evolutionary scientists tracked the evolution of the virus and rapidly provided information on the emergence of new variants, creating a viral forecast mechanism that has provided almost real-time information on the changing pandemic. This has all happened in less than 3 years and resulted in a great reduction in mortality. As such, we should be celebrating the virology community and the allied scientific communities. Remarkably, despite the fact that the virology community made critical contributions to a remarkably successful response to the CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it finds itself under attack. The bulk of this attack comes under the guise of concern about gainof-function (GOF) research and persistent concerns about the origin of SARS-CoV-2. What began 10 years ago as a civil, scholarly debate over the experiments aimed at addressing whether highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza could become transmissible from human to human has devolved to include almost all experiments in which respiratory pathogens are genetically manipulated. While much of the conversation remains courteous and thoughtful, an ever-increasing fraction has become a negative, knee-jerk reaction. All virological research is being viewed with suspicion, with the criticisms often playing out in social, online, and traditional news media environments. This type of behavior is not going to serve society well in the long run.

c66a71392e45ac18966d2b382386c2fc8eeeb6bb,Data Monetization: New Value Streams You Need Right Now,"Laney, Douglas",2020,"In both practice and academia, the incredible access to data is creating a marked disruption. The perfect storm of massive amounts of digital data, sophisticated analytical tools and cheap, scalable processing power has fostered a data-driven mindset in both corporate and academic practices. These are being embraced to varying degrees in companies around the world as well as in global academic communities. However, swinging the pendulum in the relationship between knowledge and data too far toward data can have adverse consequences. This editorial offers a cautionary note for both companies and academia. For a number of years, in practice, the distinction between data, information, and knowledge could be stated with some level of precision. Data are raw facts and figures that can become information when massaged and placed in the right context. The value-adding activities from data to information are largely the domain of information systems. Knowledge, however, adds experience and expertise to the information and often resides in tacit form in people’s heads. So, the Knowledge Management System (KMS) popularity that started in the 1990s was intended to capture knowledge (largely tacit) and put it in a system that could benefit others in the organization (Davenport & Grover, 2001). KM processes include externalization (taking tacit knowledge and representing it in a KMS) and internalization (making this knowledge accessible to people who might need it). For example, a global consulting firm might have a team that concluded a multiyear project in Malaysia – and their experiences, successes, failures, precautions, and guidance in a KMS – could be invaluable for other teams initiating projects in that region. KM practices included creating the right incentives for knowledge to flow between people and the system, as well as embedding knowledge into products and services offered. In academic research, particularly the social sciences including Information Systems, knowledge is largely represented as an abstraction – a theory or model – that explains or predicts the real world. It is in the efficacy of these abstractions, as assessed through logic or impact, that academics gain their esteem. The advent of “big data” in recent years, along with advanced analytics and machine learning has created a disruption both in the practice of KM as well as in the importance of abstraction. Big data, through its global reach and its sheer volume, velocity, and variety, along with computationally intensive analysis, offers opportunities for generating new insights. Mining of big data and digital streams can yield fresh perspectives for decision-makers, optimize and automate processes, and discover new ways to understand and fulfill customers’ needs. It can also offer precision of predictions to important questions in both practice and academia. However, in observing the ready embrace of big data and analytics there are also signs that some companies and researchers might fall into a trap where they see data replacing knowledge, blurring the distinctions in the trichotomy described above. The argument implicit in this, is that knowledge was largely a correspondence between our observation of the world and its interpretation in our brain, in the form of models that we used to make sense of observations. Now, with the plethora of data, we do not need to understand the world to know it. All knowledge can be extracted through the data. So, in this view, knowledge is not internalized through human assessment but externalized through data. While many may not endorse the data is knowledge view, companies that intensively invest in data and analytical capabilities could be accepting a data culture that comes at the cost of human interpretation and judgment.

Unfortunately, most of the burden of foodborne illness is shouldered by children under five years of age and people living in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

The fourth document, the National Policy on Food Safety and Its Implementation Strategy (NPFSIS), is Nigeria’s principal food safety policy document and was reviewed in more detail. This review focuses on the situational and analytical concepts of the policy framework of the National Food Safety System (NFSS) in Nigeria. It also examines the status of the implementation of the NPFSIS 2014 and its alignment with international best practices.

In two experimental studies, I identify conditions in which consultant recommendations and, in turn, manager MCS choices intend to benefit management rather than optimize benefits for the firm. The experiments focus on the effects of management's prestige. I find that professional consultants recommend new (as opposed to established) MCS to high prestige managers, despite believing that established MCS will benefit the firm. In turn, high prestige managers disproportionately choose the new (as opposed to established) MCS when recommended and believe doing so is the highest quality choice, even when NPV and risk are constant across MCS. When prestige is moderate, consultants recommend established MCS and managers gravitate towards these MCS. I argue that consultant involvement can lead to an MCS adoption risk: recommending and choosing MCS because they are new or used by others, not because they are better choices for the firm.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),78.57142857142857,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368218300813,"J Leiby - Accounting, Organizations and society, 2018 - Elsevier",,Goal 15,0.007580953657622599,False,

In an experiment where audit managers acted as consultants to other auditors, we examine conditions in which consultants either recommend estimates that differ substantially from advice‐seekers’ assessments (contrariness) or recommend narrower reasonable ranges of estimates (precision). Psychology theory argues that both of these attributes can improve estimates. We examine whether these attributes depend on consultants' status motives, that is, the desire to gain respect from or power over others. We find that active status motives lead consultants with higher specialized knowledge to provide recommendations that are less contrary, but more precise. However, consultants increase precision by tightening range bounds in a manner that is not counter to management's preference and thus unlikely to prompt the audit team to challenge the estimate. We also find that higher consultant decision authority constrains precision. Our findings suggest limits to consultation's potential effectiveness in improving estimates. For instance, our findings suggest that firms and standard setters direct consultants to focus scrutiny on the range bound that is most likely to constrain management opportunism.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),89.77272727272728,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-679X.12150,"WR Knechel, J Leiby - Journal of Accounting Research, 2016 - Wiley Online Library",,Goal 15,0.00444186263269917,False,

However, empirical evidence on how self-production of food affects consumption in natural settings remains limited and looks only at situations in which food not immediately consumed is lost. The present research examines how self-production affects food consumption over the course of a day. In a series of four experiments (n=798), participants either self-produced or received cookies, and reported the number of cookies eaten at the end of the day. Contrary to prior empirical investigations, we found no evidence that self-production increases consumption when participants can conserve their production. Overall, self-producers consumed 10% less throughout the day. This finding suggests that for unhealthy foods that can be conserved for several days and shared with others, such as cookies, self-production may help reduce food intake (vs. getting the same food ready-made).",Semantic Scholar ,100.0,10.1086/720447,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fe98142bf307c697db77172da1308baf02d19e2,Journal of the Association for Consumer Research,,Goal 2,0.2054082024977662,True,food production

Exploring this mismatch, the current research examines when and why consumers prefer to give material versus experiential gifts. The authors propose that gift givers are more likely to give experiential gifts to socially close recipients than socially distant recipients. Since experiences are perceived as more unique than material goods, givers perceive that choosing an experiential gift requires more specific knowledge of a recipient’s preferences to avoid the greater social risk of giving a poorly matched gift. Eight studies provide converging evidence for the proposed effect of social distance on gift preference and demonstrate that this effect is driven by a giver’s knowledge of a recipient’s preferences. Further supporting the mechanism of preference knowledge, the effect of social distance is moderated by the social risk associated with experiential gifts. When experiences contain little social risk—and thus require less knowledge of a recipient—the effect of social distance is significantly mitigated. Together, these results provide answers for why consumers often prefer to give material gifts over experiences, despite the advantage of giving experiences.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),89.24731182795699,,https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/45/2/365/4898091,"JK Goodman, S Lim - Journal of Consumer Research, 2018 - academic.oup.com",,Goal 1,0.03161861125130509,False,

Method: Two approaches were adopted: one archival and one experimental. In the archival approach, 434 firms (2,645 observations) headquartered in the US were analyzed, covering the period 2010-2017. Earnings management was proxied by accruals quality, reputation was proxied by the score on the ranking of the World’s Most Admired Companies, and Dark Tetrad personality was based on CEO speech and ‘Big Five’personality analysis. In the experimental approach, we used a 2x2 between-subjects design on a sample of 242 MBA students, most of whom had a background in management. The Dark Tetrad personality was measured with the Short Dark Triad form (Paulhus & Jones, 2014) and the Assessment of Sadistic Personality (Plouffe et al., 2017). For reputation, we adapted the scenarios of Goldberg (1990) and Lafferty (2007). Participants were asked to make five accounting decisions to gauge their disposition to commit fraud.
Results: The results confirmed that CEO personality affects earnings management and showed that a good corporate reputation reduces the likelihood of earnings management and fraud, thereby preserving accounting information quality.

Theoretical framework – The theoretical fundamentals of PEAD analysis lie in the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).
Design/methodology/approach – We use firms from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. We examine the PEAD anomaly by estimating the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) around earnings announcement dates. We replicate the analysis using a sample of firms from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for comparison. We analyze how firm-level and country-level (institutional) variables can explain the PEAD anomaly.
Findings – Under different specifications, we find that good news firms yield positive CAR while bad news firms yield negative CAR even after a window of 20 days. We find that the effect of earnings surprises on CAR in Latin America
varies with firms’ size and countries’ risk, while in the US it varies with firms’ size and the market-to-book (MTB) ratio.
Practical & social implications of research – We fill a gap in the literature on the role of accounting in the capital markets by analyzing the Latin American markets, which are usually left unexplored. In addition, our results are important for portfolio selection strategies, since the PEAD anomaly represents an opportunity to gain abnormal returns based on earnings surprises.
Originality/value – We contribute to the literature on the PEAD anomaly by providing evidence on how investors react to earnings announcements in Latin American countries. While other studies have investigated how accounting numbers are useful for investment strategies in the region, by including earnings
surprises we go back a step and first investigate the reaction around these surprises.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),88.67924528301887,,https://www.scielo.br/j/rbgn/a/FB4tKLFBHggTVRDhpLygFWB/?lang=pt,"VF Santana, EL Black, GASF Lima - Revista Brasileira de Gestão de …, 2022 - SciELO Brasil",,Goal 10,0.01356527720176175,False,

Through the descriptive statistics, factor analysis, correlations and the one-way ANOVA methods, we find that there is significant relationship between the high traits of the Dark Triad and the opportunistic decision-making, and the existence of a difference between levels (low, moderate and high) of the Dark Triad in opportunistic decision-making. Considering the presented results, this study achieved the desired goal, validated the elaborated assumptions and drew the attention of the scientific community to the potential of the Dark Triad in the business field, especially by observing the behavior of managers in the work environment. We highlight the importance of this research in the national context, since most studies, which address this theme, developed individualized investigations with the personality traits that make up the constellation Dark Triad.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://asaa.emnuvens.com.br/asaa/article/view/224,"MF D'Souza, GASF de Lima - Advances in Scientific and …, 2015 - asaa.emnuvens.com.br",,Goal 5,0.0171628047940118,False,

In this paper, we develop a dynamic model to examine the interactions between two manufacturers' distribution channel strategies and their collusion incentives. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that single distribution does not always facilitate collusion between the manufacturers and that collusion is only facilitated when both adopt single distribution channels. In other words, an asymmetric cross-distribution channel structure helps to deter upstream collusion. Our results also suggest that retail mergers can hinder upstream collusion. Furthermore, we show that the equilibrium endogenous channel structures crucially depend on the discount factor of future cash flows and the relationship between the manufacturers' products (substitutes vs. complements). Specifically, when the products are highly substitutable, and manufacturers’ value of future cash flow is sufficiently low, the win-win equilibrium channel structure operated by the manufacturers comprises single distribution channels. However, such an equilibrium channel structure hurts consumers and social welfare when compared with cross-distribution channel structures. In all other instances, the win-win equilibrium structure chosen by the manufacturers yields cross-distribution channels, which also benefit consumers and social welfare.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),90.79754601226993,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092552731930266X,"J Bian, X Zhao, Y Liu - International Journal of Production Economics, 2020 - Elsevier",,Goal 10,0.0129036296577694,False,

We develop a game-theoretic framework in which a manufacturer and a retailer are defined as leader and follower, respectively, to model the strategic interactions and the optimal advertising and pricing decisions of channel members. In this context, we find that channel decentralization may lead to greater advertising content. Moreover, we find that if the manufacturer has product advertising authority additional to the retailer’s product advertising authority, then both the product advertising provision and the price advertising provision can be greater. This additional product advertising authority can lead to the manufacturer’s higher but the retailer’s lower profit with increased overall channel profits. However, if the manufacturer has exclusive product advertising authority, as compared to the case in which both channel members can advertise product, the manufacturer’s exclusive product advertising authority can lead to a decreased product advertising provision as well as a decreased price advertising provision; and it may even hurt the manufacturer while benefiting the retailer. We also find that a shift of exclusive product advertising authority from the retailer to the manufacturer leads to a product advertising provision that is such that more consumers will visit the store and purchase the product, which benefits the overall channel for a large parameter range.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.83673469387755,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221718308956,"H Shi, Y Liu, NC Petruzzi - European Journal of Operational Research, 2019 - Elsevier",,Goal 12,0.006421127579828923,False,

In three studies using three methodologies (qualitative inductive, cultural consensus modeling, and experimental), we used data from 2,140 participants to reveal 26 domain general cues that can indicate whether a product or process is creative. About 95 percent of the Chinese used a broad range of cues, whereas about 75 percent of the Americans used a narrow range of cues. Members of both cultures found cues such as breakthrough, surprise, and potential to indicate creativity. In contrast, cues such as easy to use, feasible, and for a mass market were indicators of creativity for most Chinese and noncreativity for most Americans. Thus, in addition to domain knowledge, knowledge about creativity itself contributes to creativity assessments. Cross-cultural differences in knowledge about creativity can help explain differences in how members of different cultures assess creativity.

We thus test hypotheses that examine how CEOs’ media coverage, industry awards, and outsider standing affect the reputations of their firms.

Event study methodology is used to obtain a measure of the economic impact of information regarding a firm's human capital management investments and policies. Subsequent regression analyses are then used to test hypotheses regarding possible complementary relationships between firm‐level factors and human capital investments. Results provide robust support for the proposition that effective investments in human capital and training matter, and that these human capital investments are more impactful when combined with complementary assets of R&D, physical capital, and advertising investments.
Managerial summary: Do firm investments in training and the development of employee human capital matter with regard to financial performance? We find that, yes, these investments do matter. Our results show that managers who view employee human capital as an asset to be invested in and developed can expect to outperform those who view it as a cost to be minimized. In addition, we find that these human capital investments will be of even greater economic value to firms when they have made complementary investments in R&D, physical capital, and advertising.

Exploring Consumer Responses to AI-designed Luxury Products,"Mehta, Ravi",2022,"The current work examines how consumers respond to luxury products designed with significant utilization of technology. It delineates two inherent values of luxury products—emotional and functional—and argues that utilizing technology in the luxury product design process negatively impacts the emotional value but enhances the associated functional value. Such paradoxical impact of AI-led design on emotional and functional values leads to a differential effect on consumer response patterns. For luxury products that particularly draw on their superior emotional value (e.g., luxury fashion brands), using AI as a design source significantly reduces the perceived brand essence, leading to negative consumer response. However, when a luxury brand draws its essence from the associated functional value (in addition to the emotional value), either because of the product characteristics (e.g., luxury automobiles) or when such value is made externally salient (e.g., through marketing message appeals), the negative response is attenuated.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),93.10344827586206,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-022-00854-x,"L Xu, R Mehta - Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 2022 - Springer",,Goal 9,0.02156311426904178,False,

Using a unique dataset of 467 COMPUSTAT firms with credit lines, we study the purpose of drawdowns during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Our data show that credit line drawdowns had already increased in 2007, precisely when disruptions in bank funding markets began to squeeze aggregate liquidity. Consistent with theory, our results confirm that firms use drawdowns to sustain investment after an idiosyncratic liquidity shock. Using an instrumental variable approach based on institutional features of credit line contracts, we find that a one standard deviation increase in credit line drawdown is associated with an increase of 9 percent in average capital expenditures. Low aggregate liquidity amplifies this effect significantly. During the financial crisis, the effect of drawdowns on investment increased to 16 percent. The effect was even larger for smaller and financially constrained firms.

In our first experiment, we predict and find that investors are more likely to rely on the investment recommendation of an unnamed robo‐advisor, whereas they are more likely to rely on the investment recommendation of a named human advisor. Theory suggests one reason that naming a robo‐advisor may have drawbacks pertains to the complexity of the task the robo‐advisor performs. We explore the importance of task complexity in our second experiment. We predict and find that investors are less likely to rely on a named robo‐advisor when the advisor is perceived to be performing a relatively complex task, consistent with our first experiment, and more likely to rely on a named robo‐advisor when the advisor is perceived to be performing a relatively simple task, consistent with prior research on human‐computer interactions. Our findings contribute to the literature examining how technology influences the acquisition and use of financial information and the general literature on human‐computer interactions.

We study how MNCs respond to these pressures through the revelatory case of the global divestment campaign against Royal Dutch/Shell during the racist apartheid regime in South Africa in the 1980s. We combine archival-based historical research and visual rhetorical analysis, and find that Royal Dutch/Shell developed a strategy consisting of creating counter-narratives at three different levels for actors within the MNC that had different interests. First, the headquarters sought to avoid setting a precedent for future boycotts; second, the peripheral subsidiaries aimed to avoid having their reputation tarnished by what was happening in South Africa; and third, the focal subsidiary was fighting for its survival.

Specifically, we contend that mechanisms of social closure—discriminatory evaluation, knowledge- and resource-hoarding, and the preservation of dominant group identities—not only restrict URMs’ access to the academic pipeline, but also contribute its “leaks.” After discussing these mechanisms, we conclude with recommendations to the AACSB, an institution that can facilitate change and reduce social closure within business schools.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amle.2015.0215,"I Minefee, VC Rabelo, OJC Stewart IV… - … Learning & Education, 2018 - journals.aom.org",,Goal 10,0.0235076660560118,False,

This research considers a multi-trip truck-drone routing problem under uncertainty. Each truck is allowed to take multiple trips from the depot, while each drone is allowed to perform a single trip from the launch locations. Based on customer preferences, deliveries are grouped into deliveries by trucks to distribution centers and deliveries by drones from distribution centers to customers. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the sum of the waiting times of all customers. To deal with uncertainty, a new two-stage clustering algorithm that uses multiple-kernel learning-based and single-kernel learning-based methods is introduced to construct uncertainty sets. In the case of column-wised uncertainty, a two-stage clustering with a dimensional separation algorithm is developed to avoid over-conservatism. A two-step solution method is provided for solving the proposed robust model to reduce the CPU time. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on several test problems. The results indicate that the developed algorithms can effectively avoid over-conservatism, reduce variables and constraints of the data-driven robust counterpart model, and reduce the CPU time required to solve the problem.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423029871,"MR Ghiasvand, D Rahmani… - Expert Systems with …, 2024 - Elsevier",,Goal 4,0.00733349028008106,False,

Specifically, new business models and services are enabled due to technological advancements in information technology, vehicle autonomy and connectivity, vehicle electrification, payment methodologies, and clearing solutions. Notable trending topics include: drones and autonomous ground vehicles, physical internet for parcel and cargo delivery, electric vehicles and micromobility, ride-sharing and ride-hailing, crowd shipping and the gig economy, same-day delivery of goods and meals, collaborated transportation, and brokering. We have invited and received a broad range of operational research papers that study these topics for this special issue. In what follows, we briefly describe the seven research papers included in this issue, covering a wide range of trending topics. To these papers, we have added a survey paper that provides an overview of future directions for research in urban mobility and city logistics [4]. In particular, the survey focuses on three main developments: vehicle autonomy, crowdsourced logistics, and urban micro-consolidation centers. Abbaas and Ventura [1] study the continuous deviation-flow refueling station location problem on a general network that arises in the context of alternative fuels. They propose an exact algorithm that determines the endpoints of all refueling segments on each edge of the network that cover the corresponding origin-destination flows. This set of endpoints is used in a set covering model to locate multiple refueling stations under the assumption that every vehicle only refuels once on each way of its round trip. A numerical experiment illustrates the performance of the proposed methodology. Arrieta–Prieto et al. [2] formulate the last-mile delivery problem assisted by urban micro-consolidation centers as a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained program (MIQCP) and develop a greedy heuristic solution, inspired by decomposition algorithms for large-scale optimization. Simulation results and a case study in Manhattan (NY, USA) demonstrate that the proposed heuristic can provide good results with respect to the exact solution and can be used for freight-efficient urban design and policy planning. Haferkamp and Ehmke [3] study demand and fulfillment control policies in ride-sharing systems. They classify the existing policies in the literature and explore the effectiveness of such policies under varying conditions in order to identify benefits and risks for ride-sharing systems. For this purpose, the authors define policies that differ in the optimization of demand and/or fulfillment control through the exploitation of either confirmed or complete information. Experimental results demonstrate that demand and fulfillment control have different effects on ride-sharing systems’ performance and service quality. Le et al. [5] analyze the impact of optimized coordination between autonomous vehicles and traffic-light controlled intersections. To this end, they develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on a microscopic traffic model with centrally controlled autonomous vehicles and they incorporate traffic-light switching regulations. Their model allows an estimation of the maximum performance gains due to improved communication and serves as a benchmark for decentralized approaches. An evaluation of the numerical results with a traffic simulation tool shows that performance indicators such as time, energy, and emissions can be reduced significantly compared to simulated real-world traffic. In addition, the authors evaluate the performance of a moving horizon approach which exposes the trade-off between performance and real-time feasibility. Ostermeier et al. [6] present an approach to cost-optimal routing of a truck-and-robot system for last-mile deliveries with time windows. Their solution algorithm is based on a combination of a neighborhood search with cost-specific priority rules",Semantic Scholar,50.40650406504065,10.1002/net.22093,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d68783f7e04d4dd7699eb55f43224e50fabf38b,Networks,,Goal 11,0.1251404482658629,True,traffic congestion; urban mobility

In these models, drones are launched from the truck to deliver packages and return to the truck after delivery. The considered models vary with respect to the level of synchronization between the truck and the drones. We mathematically formulate the associated routing problems and prove theoretical bounds on the maximum possible savings that can be obtained by these models compared to truck-only routes. Further, we use a Truck and Drone Routing Algorithm (TDRA), which we use to evaluate these models on four sets of problem instances, as well as two realistic case studies. Our numerical results indicate that a higher level of synchronization considerably leads to reduced customer waiting times. The results of our case study analysis also show that these models can obtain more than 60% customer waiting time reduction compared to a truck-only scenario although the percentage of reduction depends on the values of the underlying parameters of the problem, such as the number of drones, the drone to truck speed ratio, and the drone flight time limit.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),90.0,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835221005520,"M Moshref-Javadi, A Hemmati… - Computers & Industrial …, 2021 - Elsevier",,Goal 12,0.007968199515669964,False,

While our proposed classification defines the boundaries and facilitates the comparison between a wide variety of possible drone-based logistics systems, our comprehensive literature review helps to identify and prioritize research gaps that need to be addressed by future work. Our review shows that the extant research reasonably considers some relevant real-world operational constraints. Although the multi-visit multi-drone Pure-play Drone-based (PD) delivery models are popular, the majority of the Synchronized Multi-modal (SM) delivery models focus on formulating and evaluating single-truck, single-drone models. Moreover, the Resupply Multi-modal (RM) models have not received the due attention for research compared to other drone-based delivery models.

In this system, truck and UAV operations are synchronized, i.e., one or more UAVs travel on a truck, which serves as a mobile depot. Deliveries can be made by both UAVs and the truck. While the truck follows a multi-stop route, each UAV delivers a single shipment per dispatch. The presented optimization model minimizes the waiting time of customers in the system. The model determines the optimal allocation of customers to truck and UAVs, the optimal route sequence of the truck, and the optimal launch and reconvene locations of the UAVs along the truck route. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and conduct a bound analysis to gauge the maximum potential of the proposed system to reduce customer waiting time compared to a traditional truck-only delivery system. To be able to solve real-world problem size instances, we propose an efficient Truck and Drone Routing Algorithm (TDRA).

To improve order picking operations, the total travel distance and generally picking time must be reduced. In this paper, a two-level approach is proposed that determines the locations of parts in the warehouse. The first step clusters parts into part families. Four different clustering methods based on principal component analysis, singular value decomposition and Two-Step Cluster Component are applied. In the second step, four different heuristics are proposed to determine the locations of parts. In addition to the minimisation of travel distance, we also consider the minimisation of the total congestion in aisles due to multiple workers. The proposed algorithms also consider the interactions between part families to minimise intergroup movements. As a result of the implementation, we achieved more than 40% reduction in material handling compared to the current set-up of the warehouse. The applied algorithms can easily be modified to be used for warehouses with different configurations.

Sixteen PM samples spanning in various seasons (fall, winter, spring and summer) were collected from an urban site in central Illinois. Cytotoxicity (LC50) in terms of the volume of air that kills 50% of the cells were calculated, which varied from 4.3 to 7.2 m3 of air. The OP was measured by two assays – the dithiothreitol (DTT) and the surrogate lung fluid (SLF) assay. In DTT assay, we measured two endpoints – hydroxyl radicals (•OH) generation and DTT consumption (the conventionally measured endpoint), while only •OH generation was measured in the SLF assay. Although, all three endpoints in the OP assays correlated significantly (P ≤ 0.05) with LC50, the correlation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in DTT and SLF assays was much higher (r > 0.80 for •OH generation versus LC50) than the DTT consumption (r = 0.58). To further understand the components in PM that drive cytotoxicity and OP, concentration of water-soluble metals (Fe, Cu, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, Hg, and Zn), organic carbon (OC), water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and elemental carbon (EC) were measured. Among all the chemical components, Fe, Cu and WSOC correlated most (r > 0.70; P ≤ 0.01) with the cytotoxicity. DTT consumption correlated only with OC and WSOC (r > 0.80; P ≤ 0.01), while •OH generation in DTT and SLF assay correlated with both WSOC (r > 0.70; P ≤ 0.01) and metals (i.e. Fe and Cu; r > 0.75; P ≤ 0.01). Our results suggest a strong link between the PM2.5 OP and its cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the synergistic interactions among the organic compounds (i.e. WSOC) and metals (Fe and Cu) to enhance the ROS generation, which are more effectively captured in •OH generation endpoints in DTT and SLF assay than the DTT consumption, appear to be largely responsible for the observed mammalian cell cytotoxicity of PM2.5.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231018301031,"Y Wang, MJ Plewa, UK Mukherjee, V Verma - Atmospheric Environment, 2018 - Elsevier",,Goal 6,0.04741740658561602,False,

A similar return pattern holds for all maturity and moneyness categories, equity and ETF options, and VIX futures. Rational theories struggle to explain positive intraday returns. We show that returns change sign and become positive because option prices fail to account for the well-known fact that stock volatility is substantially higher intraday than overnight.

706ac60fc299b6867919c87d5fc5002dbc2abadf,Application of Survival Model to Understand Open Source Software Release,"Nelson, Matthew",2015,"One of the recurrent themes in open source software research is to understand the impacts of various project characteristics on its success. Open source software (OSS) projects rely on voluntary participation of developers and tend to be continually in development. Hence, an important measure of success is the time it takes for an OSS project to release a stable version to its users. However, there is little research on this success measure and how the OSS characteristics enable or delay the progress towards stable release. In this study, we use survival analysis technique on open source project data to explore the impacts of OSS characteristics on the time it takes to release stable software versions. We find that when compared to the interest of developers in the project, interest of end-users has a greater positive effect on an OSS project progress towards stable release. Our findings also suggest that the use of C and C-like programming languages or a Weak-Copyleft license for the open source project negatively impact the project’s time to reach stable status. In OSS projects less than 8 months since becoming public, the use of a Strong-Copyleft license positively affects the project’s progress. One of the implications of our findings is that OSS project administrators should control software change requests or form smaller developer groups to better control the delays due to higher developer interest in their projects.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),90.27777777777777,,https://aisel.aisnet.org/pajais/vol7/iss2/1/,"R Sen, M Nelson, C Subramaniam - Pacific Asia Journal of the …, 2015 - aisel.aisnet.org",,Goal 17,0.01231608244695407,False,

Two consistent themes have been present in that literature: first, repetition of advertising enhances memory, and second, distributing advertisements over time increases their longer-term retention. The verbal learning literature refors to such memory enhancement as the Hspacing effict"" and three theories have been forwarded to account for these prevalent findings: encoding variability, study-phase retrievat and reconstruction. The purpose of this investigation is to, through a series of experiments; determine the theory that best explains the spacing effect in an advertising setting. We have been able to identify two diffirent theories that provide robust explanations of the spacing effect in this context. The sheer ubiquity of this effect has led to several multifactorial explanations of the spacing effect to describe different patterns of results obtained by using difforent materials (familiar vs. unfamiliar) or diffirent memory tasks (cued vs. free recall)(Dempster 1996; Janiszewski, Noel and Sawyer 2003). Our research furthers our understanding of the spacing effict, and how time might influence how the various pieces of information are used in memory. Our results support reconstruction theory, and this finding has both theoretical and practical implications for media scheduling, ad design, and advertising research. The spacing effect paradigm could be used to help guide the timing and distribution of advertising messages. More specifically, reconstruction theory could be used to form specific hypotheses concerning the timing, type, and potential media environment.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.93548387096774,,https://search.proquest.com/openview/02ee26ac51d3ab4b51d67443749cf08f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026610,"H Noel, KA LaTour - The Business & Management Review, 2017 - search.proquest.com",,Goal 4,0.004988978809685178,False,

We propose that the transformation of ideas into a great strategy is shaped by the firm’s identity and corresponding patterns of organizational attention. Furthermore, great strategies focus attention on creating value for the customer—through the firm’s value proposition and business model—relative to capturing value for the shareholders. Finally, we propose that great strategies emerge from a focused, strategic agenda communicated and distributed throughout the organization. We illustrate our propositions by comparing Apple and Motorola, which began with similar ideas for developing a strategy for seamless integration and seamless mobility, with smartphones as the digital hub.

Although many royal houses around the world occupy a symbolic/ceremonial rather than a political role, royalty and the “human brands” royal families contain remain important sources of aspirational and conspicuous consumption. In this essay, we focus on how the British Royal Family Brand (BRFB; Otnes, Cele C. and Pauline Maclaran. 2015. Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture. Berkeley: University of California Press.) has remained the most visible and impactful royal variant in the world, even as its economic and political influence, and that of Britain, has waned. We discuss the influence of the BRFB in fueling consumption practices pertaining to commemorative purchasing and collecting, heritage management, perpetuating mass and social media narratives, supporting and perpetuating brands, and spawning and maintaining touristic trends. We observe that successful royal influence is due in part to the ability to leverage key universal narratives (e.g. the triumph of the underdog) and to tap into consumers’ desires to vicariously or actively engage with lifestyles typically accessible only to people who occupy the highest social stratum in their respective cultures.

Commercial production of coffee outside Yemen started in Sri Lanka in the 1660s, Java in the 1700s, and Latin America in 1715, and this production has associations with histories of colonial expansion and slavery. Introduced to Europe in the 17th century, coffee was described by Robert Burton in the section of his 1628 Anatomy of Melancholy devoted to medicines as “an intoxicant, a euphoric, a social and physical stimulant, and a digestive aid” (quoted in Weinberg and Bealer xii). Today, more than 400 billion cups of coffee are consumed each year. Coffee is also an ingredient in a series of iconic dishes such as tiramisu and, with chocolate, makes up the classic mocha mix. Coffee production is widespread in tropical and sub-tropical countries and it is the second largest traded world commodity; second only to oil and petroleum. The World Bank estimates that more than 500 million people throughout the world depend on coffee for their livelihoods, and 25 million of these are coffee farmers. Unfortunately, these farmers typically live and work in substandard conditions and receive only a small percentage of the final price that their coffee is sold for. The majority of coffee farmers are women and they face additional challenges, frequently suffering from abuse, neglect, and poverty, and unable to gain economic, social, or political power in either their family’s coffee businesses or their communities. Some farm coffee under enslaved or indentured conditions, although Fair Trade regimes are offering some lessening of inequalities. At the opposite end of the scale, a small, but growing, number of high-end producers market gourmet sustainable coffee from small-scale, environmentally-aware farming operations. For many in the West today, however, coffee is not about the facts of its production; coffee is all about consumption, and is now interwoven into our contemporary cultural and social habits. Caffeine, found in the leaves, seeds, and fruit of the coffee tree, is an addictive psychoactive substance, but has overcome resistance and disapproval around the world and is now unregulated and freely available, without licence. Our gastronomic sophistication is reflected in which coffee, brewing method, and location of consumption is chosen; our fast-paced lifestyles in the range of coffee-to-go options we have; and our capitalist orientation in the business opportunities this popularity has offered to small entrepreneurs and multinational franchise chains alike. Cafes and the meeting, mingling, discussions, and relaxing that occur there while drinking coffee, are a contemporary topic of reflection and scholarship, as are the similarities and differences between the contemporary cafe and its earlier incarnations, including, of course, the Enlightenment coffee house. As may be expected from a commodity which has such a place in our lives, coffee is represented in many ways in the media—including in advertising, movies, novels, poetry, songs and, of course, in culinary writing, including cookbooks, magazines, and newspapers. There are specialist journals and popular serials dedicated to expounding and exploring the fine grain detail of its production and consumption, and food historians have written multiple biographies of coffee’s place in our world. So ubiquitous, indeed, is coffee, that as a named colour, it popularly features in fashion, interior design, home wares, and other products. This issue of M/C Journal invited contributors to consider coffee from any relevant angle that makes a contribution to our understanding of coffee and its place in culture and/or the media, and the result is a valuable array of illuminating articles from a diverse range of perspectives. It is for this reason that we chose an image of coffee cherries for the front cover of this issue. Co-editor Jill Adams has worked in the coffee industry for over ten years and has a superb collection of coffee images that ranges from farmers in Papua New Guinea to artfully shot compositions of antique coffee brewing equipment. In making our choice, however, we felt that Spencer Franks’s image of ripe coffee cherries at the Skybury Coffee Plantation in Far North Queensland, Australia, encapsulates the “fruitful” nature of the response to our call for articles for this issue. While most are familiar, moreover, with the dark, glossy appearance and other sensual qualities of roasted coffee beans, fewer have any occasion to contemplate just how lovely the coffee tree is as a plant. Each author has utilised the idea of “coffee” as a powerful springboard into a fascinating range of areas, showing just how inseparable coffee is from so many parts of our daily lives—even scholarly enquiry. In our first feature article, Susie Khamis profiles and interrogates the Nespresso brand, and how it points to the growing individualisation of coffee consumption, whereby the social aspect of cafes gives way to a more self-centred consumer experience. This feature valuably contrasts the way Starbucks has marketed itself as a social hub with the Nespresso boutique experience—which as Khamis explains—is not a cafe, but rather a club, a trademarked, branded space, predicated on highly knowledgeable and, therefore, privileged patrons. Coffee drinking is also associated with both sobriety and hangover cures, with cigarettes, late nights, and music. Our second feature, by Jon Stewart, looks at how coffee has become interwoven into our lives and imaginations through the music that we listen to—from jazz to blues to musical theatre numbers. It examines the influence of coffee as subject for performers and songwriters in three areas: coffee and courtship rituals, the stimulating effects of caffeine, and the politics of coffee consumption, claiming that coffee carries a cultural and musicological significance comparable to that of other drugs and ubiquitous consumer goods that are often more readily associated with popular music. Diana Noyce looks at the short-lived temperance movement in Australia, the opulent architecture of the coffee palaces built in that era, what was actually drunk in them, and their fates as the temperance movement passed into history. Emma Felton lyrically investigates how “going for a coffee” is less about coffee and more about how we connect with others in a mobile world, when flexible work hours are increasingly the norm and more people are living alone than any other period in history. Felton also introducess a theme that other writers also engage with: that the cafe also plays a role in the development of civil discourse and civility, and plays an important role in the development of cosmopolitan civil societies. Ireland-based Mairtin Mac Con Iomaire surveys Dublin—that tea drinking city—and both the history of coffee houses and the enduring coffee culture it possesses; a coffee culture that seems well assured through a remarkable win for Ireland in the 2008 World Barista Championships. China has also always been strongly associated with tea drinking but Adel Wang introduces readers to the emerging, and unique, cafe and coffee culture of that country, as well as some of the proprietors who are bringing about this cultural change. Australia, also once a significant consumer of tea, shifted to a preference for coffee over a twenty year period that began with the arrival of American Servicemen in Australia during World War II. Jill Adams looks at the rise of coffee during that time, and the efforts made by the tea industry to halt its market growth. These strong links between tea and coffee are reflected in Duncan Barnes, Danielle Fusco, and Lelia Green’s thought-provoking study of how coffee is marketed in Bangladesh, another tea drinking country. Ray Oldenberg’s influential concept of the “third place” is referred to by many authors in this collection, but Anthony McCosker and Rowan Wilken focus on this idea. By using a study of how Polish composer, Krzysztof Penderecki, worked in his local cafe from 9 in the morning to noon each day, this article explores the interrelationship of cafe space, communication, creativity, and materialism. Donna Lee Brien brings us back to the domestic space with her article on how the popular media of cookery books and magazines portray how coffee was used in Australian cooking at mid-century, in the process, tracing how tiramisu triumphed over the trifle.  By exploring the currently fashionable practice of “direct trade” between roasters and coffee growers Sophie Sunderland offers a fresh perspective on coffee production by powerfully arguing that feeling (“affect”) is central to the way in which coffee is produced, represented and consumed in Western mass culture. Sunderland thus brings the issue full circle and back to Khamis’s discussion, for there is much feeling mobilised in the marketing of Nespresso.  We would like to thank all the contributors and our generous and erudite peer reviewers for their work in the process of putting together this issue. We would also like to specially thank Spencer Franks for permission to use his image of coffee cherries as our cover image. We would lastly like to thank you the general editors of M/C Journal for selecting this theme for the journal this year. References Oldenburg, Ray, ed.

Recent research presents evidence of an informational channel through which option trading affects stock prices by showing that option market makers’ stock trades to hedge new options positions cause the information reflected in option trading to be impounded into underlying equity prices. This paper provides evidence of a noninformational channel through which option market maker hedge rebalancing affects stock return volatility and the probability of large stock price moves.,Crossref,100.0,10.1093/rfs/hhaa082,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhaa082,The Review of Financial Studies,,Goal 17,0.01951422684595464,False,

Well-known problems with the sample covariance matrix are that it is singular when the number of observations is less than the number of assets, and can be nearly singular when the number of observations exceeds the number of assets. Therefore, using the sample covariance matrix as an input in mean-variance optimisation can result in unreasonable optimal portfolios and badly biased estimates of Sharpe ratios. We address this problem by imposing structure on the estimated covariance matrix by putting constraints on the Sharpe ratio, asset return variances, and the variance of the global minimum variance portfolio. We show that the constrained maximum likelihood estimator (CMLE) performs better than the sample covariance matrix. Moreover, when the shrinkage approach is applied to the CMLE and single index covariance matrix, it performs better than the shrinkage estimator of Ledoit and Wolf (2004).",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),92.63157894736842,,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCEE.2016.073352,"H Yilmaz, ND Pearson - International Journal of …, 2016 - inderscienceonline.com",,Goal 17,0.004355356958413002,False,

This study employs a quantitative research approach to evaluate the current state of tax compliance, and proposes solutions for more effective tax administration. Data were collected from 291 digital content creators operating across various platforms throughout Vietnam. The survey questionnaires were distributed via email, and the collected data were subsequently analyzed using SmartPLS 3.2.9.

This paper examines the ethical role of the accounting profession in this project, which supported the transatlantic eugenics movement and its genocidal attempts to eliminate disabled persons from the population. We use a theoretical approach based on Levinas who argued that the self is generated through engagement with the Other, and that this engagement presupposes a responsibility to and for the Other. We show that successive waves of legislation relied on State and County auditors along with Township clerks and assessors to conduct the mechanics of the enumeration of the population, which focused on the identification, categorization, and counting of the disabled people of the State. We argue that the accounting-based technologies of enumeration and reporting objectify the enumerated persons and deny the auditor’s pre-existing ethical obligation to this new Other. We show how the financial expertise and structures of the State were engaged in the execution of this mandate, which remained in place for over a century and supported a program of institutionalization.

This study evaluates the impact of consumer perceptions of advisors' financial designations/credentials on rate of compensation to the FSP when controlling for consumer age, income, and investable assets. It further evaluates the impact of consumer perceptions of advisors' financial designations/credentials on consumers' perceived value received when controlling for consumer age, income, and investable assets. Using data from Advisor Impact's 2014"" Economics of Loyalty Research"" survey, this study finds that consumers who value designations, as well as those with higher incomes and investable assets, pay advisors more than those who do not. The study also finds that consumers in older age groups tend to pay less to their advisors than the youngest age group, possibly indicating less of a need for financial advice. As a potential explanation for why those who value designations tend to pay more to their FSPs, the results regarding the perception of value received suggest that consumers who value designations also perceive greater value in return for the fees paid to their FSP. For advisors, these results provide support for the acquisition of designations as a means for greater perceived value on behalf of the consumer, and ultimately, higher levels of compensation.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.52542372881356,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3073707,"S Raskie, J Martin, C Lemoine… - Available at SSRN …, 2017 - papers.ssrn.com",,Goal 10,0.02506616941451069,False,financial systems

Grounded in dual-processing theory, this study combines survey and archival data to assess the impact of creative versus deliberate problem-solving styles on solving success. The results indicate that both styles can be effective, but their relative success depends on the amount of time a solver invests in a solution and his or her degree of contextual familiarity with the problem. Specifically, creative (deliberate) styles are more effective under conditions of high (low) contextual familiarity and shorter (longer) time investments.

It is not clear, however, whether this decline reflects students being discouraged from pursuing an academic career by the challenges of obtaining a faculty job or whether it reflects more fundamental changes in students’ career goals for reasons other than the academic labor market. We examine this question using a longitudinal survey that follows a cohort of PhD students from 39 U.S. research universities over the course of graduate training to document changes in career preferences and to explore potential drivers of such changes. We report two main results. First, although the vast majority of students start the PhD interested in an academic research career, over time 55% of all students remain interested while 25% lose interest entirely. In addition, 15% of all students were never interested in an academic career during their PhD program, while 5% become more interested. Thus, the declining interest in an academic career is not a general phenomenon across all PhD students, but rather reflects a divergence between those students who remain highly interested in an academic career and other students who are no longer interested in one. Second, we show that the decline we observe is not driven by expectations of academic job availability, nor by related factors such as postdoctoral requirements or the availability of research funding. Instead, the decline appears partly due to the misalignment between students’ changing preferences for specific job attributes on the one hand, and the nature of the academic research career itself on the other. Changes in students’ perceptions of their own research ability also play a role, while publications do not.

We argue that mandatory portfolio disclosures reduce fund managers' incentive to collect and trade on private information, which reduces the stock price informativeness of their portfolio, and thus portfolio firm managers' ability to learn from their firms' stock prices. Using a difference-in-differences design around the May 2004 SEC regulation requiring more frequent fund disclosure, we find that investment sensitivity to stock price declines for firms with significant ownership held by actively managed funds affected by the regulation. The decline in investment-price sensitivity is concentrated among firms that are (i) owned by funds with larger expected proprietary costs and (ii) more likely to learn from price.

However, investors are likely to perceive and evaluate M&As holistically—that is, as complex configurations (i.e., gestalts) of characteristics, rather than as a list of independent factors. And, yet, extant M&A literature has not addressed why and how configurations of factors elicit positive or negative reactions. Overlooking the interdependent nature of factors known to influence acquisition success has limited our understanding of both M&As and investor judgment. Taking an inductive approach to addressing this important issue, the present study relies on fuzzy set methodology. Our results provide compelling evidence that investor perceptions of M&A announcements are not only configurational in nature but also characterized by equifinality (or the presence of multiple paths to success) and asymmetric causality (i.e., configurations that represent bad deals are not simply a mirror image of good deals, but differ fundamentally). By constructing a typology of “good” and “bad” deals as perceived by market participants, we develop a mid-range theory of M&A stock market performance.

259f21130d0072497c51eb43dc89a4857c31a0cb,Outsourcing as a Risk,"Seshadri, Sridhar",2024,"Subject. This article examines the prospects for outsourcing of financial functions and the problems of banks caused by objective risks and the lack of legal status of outsourcing.
Objectives. The article aims to identify the key objective factors of the development and risks of outsourcing based on new digital technologies in the financial sector and assess the feasibility of segregating outsourcing contracts in the legal field to improve regulatory practice.
Methods. For the study, we used an interdisciplinary approach, contextual analysis, and comparison.
Results. The article formulates a set of key factors that stimulate the development of outsourcing of functions in the financial sector and cause an increase in the importance of risks for the banking business. It presents the author-developed approach to distinguishing the terms Financial Service, Financial Function and Microservice as part of a financial service. The article specifies possible benefits for the bank in the legal definition of an outsourcing transaction.
Conclusions and Relevance. Outsourcing of financial functions is an objectively necessary way to strengthen the competitiveness of banks in the digital economy, and some of the presented problems of banks related to outsourcing of functions can be solved by introducing a specific form of outsourcing agreement into the legal field. The material of the article is of practical importance for the risk management of the financial sector, as well as specialists in the legal support of regulation of the financial sector of the economy.",Semantic Scholar,37.62376237623762,10.24891/fc.30.6.1310,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e60f69cccec25469826013e7592160b46d887ee6,Finance and Credit,,Goal 17,0.04077092160188883,False,

Their key finding is that flexible firms, that is, companies that can temporarily suspend production to avoid operational losses, for instance, due to unattractive commodity production margins, invest earlier and use less debt compared to inflexible firms. Wu and Ritchken (2021) develop and analyze a model to study how operational flexibility alters both the timing and financing of investments in production capacity.[Extracted from the article]

Stagnating yields and soil degradation due to intensive cropping pose a significant threat to long-term agricultural productivity in the state. In this paper, we focus on the farmers’ decision-making process and identify policy changes that are required to incentivize farmers to cultivate a diverse portfolio of crops and reduce dependence on paddy and wheat. Using data from four representative districts of Punjab, we quantify the impact of introducing alternate crops on the farmers’ profitability. Our analysis shows that incorporating horticultural crops in the mix increases net expected returns from cultivation for all land size classes. We also find that including alternate crops reduces water usage by up to 30 % for most farmers, while increasing the labor and working capital requirements. We also examine risk factors—price, labor, credit and yield risk—that might be contributing to the status quo and suggest risk mitigation strategies to promote crop diversification.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40622-016-0129-1,"A Chhatre, S Devalkar, S Seshadri - Decision, 2016 - Springer",,Goal 6,0.1379856003617994,True,agricultural water use; rural water scarcity

We explore the problem from a central policymaker's perspective who wants to maximize social welfare. We consider two stakeholders, retailers, and consumers, who optimize their own objectives (i.e., profits and net utility) and three competitive settings (i.e., monopoly, monopolistic competition with symmetric market share, and monopolistic competition with asymmetric market share). For the monopoly case, we find that when the retailer's profit is high, imposing some carbon emission charges on the retailer and the consumers does not substantially change the supply chain structure or the social welfare. However, when the retailer's profit is low, imposing carbon costs optimally can lead to a significant increase in social welfare. Moreover, the impact of imposing carbon emission charges becomes more significant when the degree of competition increases.

Our inductive, grounded theory building approach uncovers that ringleaders—founders who spearhead spinout creation—are driven by a nonpecuniary desire to create in a fertile environment, when they encounter frictions within the parent firm. Cofounders share the desire to create, but ensure departure on good terms to retain the option of returning to paid employment as a safeguard against entrepreneurial risk. We uncover an endogenous team building process in which more successful founding teams engage in “workplace instrumentality”—creating workplaces through deliberate selection of cofounders who have complementary functional knowledge, but are similar in that they possess superior problem‐solving abilities, best‐in‐class talent, and common workplace values.
The paper examines the motivations and founding team building processes of individuals who leave existing firms to create new ventures. In contrast to conventional wisdom that suggests preformed teams working on innovation projects leave together, we find founding teams are created when a “ringleader” chooses to venture out and subsequently seeks out cofounders. Ringleaders and cofounders alike are motivated by a desire to create given fertile opportunities and care deeply about equity, but ringleaders additionally experience at least one organizational push factor. Almost all founding teams are created to ensure the presence of complementary, functional knowledge. However, more successful spinouts also select cofounders who are hands on problem‐solvers, best‐in‐class talent, and who share common workplace values.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),92.70833333333333,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3027,"SK Shah, R Agarwal… - Strategic Management …, 2019 - Wiley Online Library",,Goal 8,0.01804195557915056,False,

However, in many non-Western cultures, these steps are less likely to be shaped by individual preferences and priorities. Instead, they emerge from a collectivistic motivation to adapt to prevailing norms and others’ expectations, and are shaped by a holistic thinking style that emphasizes context and relationships. As a result, the meaning of each step in the consumer journey is likely to be normatively infused and contextually embedded. This paper will review research showing cross-cultural differences in responses to prices, ads, store displays, retailer reputations, coupons, and other characteristics important to the retail context. Our focus is on contrasting the consumer journey in individualistic contexts versus collectivistic ones, but we also address emerging findings on other key cultural differences, such as power distance belief.

Next, we highlight the role of holistic and analytic thinking in consumer phenomena ranging from pricing to branding. We then describe the horizontal and vertical refinement of individualism and collectivism, and the power distance belief dimension, both of which address cultural orientations toward hierarchy and power.

Thus, although removing an unethical founder may distance the brand from the moral transgression, it also compromises continuity authenticity by suggesting that the company has disrupted its connection to its essence, resulting in no net gain to brand reputation.

However, across an analysis of the “no-makeup movement” on Twitter and Nielsen cosmetic sales (Study 1a), an image analysis of #nomakeup selfies using machine learning approaches (Study 1b), and three experiments (Studies 2–4), we find that calls to look natural can be associated with increased artificial beauty practices. Drawing from attribution theory, we theorize that calls to look natural maintain the value of attractiveness while adding the consumer concern that others will discount their attractiveness if overt effort is present. Thus, rather than investing less effort, consumers may engage in a self-presentational strategy wherein they construct an appearance of naturalness to signal low effort to others, thereby augmenting their attractiveness.

This preference arises from the perception that items with earlier serial numbers are temporally closer to the origin (e.g., the designer or artist who produced it). In turn, beliefs in contagion (the notion that objects may acquire a special essence from their past) lead consumers to view these items as possessing more of a valued essence. Using an archival data set and five lab experiments, the authors find the preference for items with earlier serial numbers holds across multiple consumer domains including recorded music, art, and apparel. Further, this preference appears to be independent from inferences about the quality of the item, salience of the number, or beliefs about market value. Finally, when serial numbers no longer reflect beliefs about proximity to the origin, the preference for items with earlier serial numbers is attenuated.

Remixing existing recipes generates many possibilities; the algorithm selects the most surprising and flavorful ingredient lists suggested by the model. The system then determines recipe steps and ingredient proportions. The design and use of this creation system involved human collaborators, both in structuring the data used to train the system and in cocreating the recipes it developed. The celebrity chef James Briscione described Chef Watson as an innovation partner, saying,“Watson forced me to approach ingredients without any preconceived notions of which ingredients pair well together.” Creative computational machines can operate autonomously, such as systems that write (serviceable) business and sports news or (quite bad) poetry. These systems require little human oversight to produce their creations. However, they can also operate semiautonomously, producing novel artifacts in collaboration with human experts, as illustrated by Chef Watson and older systems such as AARON the painter, which was hand-coded by its creator, Harold Cohen, and the Automated Mathematician, an early AI system that its creator, Douglas Lenat, claimed could produce mathematical conjectures. Margaret Boden, a scholar who has written extensively on the potential of computational creativity, suggests two areas in which individuals with deep domain knowledge can enhance innovation in conjunction with creative machines. First, such expertise may be important for defining the conceptual space and specifying procedures to explore that space’s creative potential. These inputs may need to be iterative, as the richness of human understanding about a problem domain may be difficult to articulate in a single instance and the domain may itself evolve, requiring creative systems to be refined and modified over time.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.83673469387755,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/26949112,"D Somaya, LR Varshney - Issues in Science and Technology, 2020 - JSTOR",,Goal 2,0.03237330006474765,False,

While the government initiative includes electronics manufacturing, it is too narrow, and too government-centric. Instead, digital technology can be a foundation for broad-based growth, taking advantage of ongoing innovations in hardware, and especially in software. The falling cost of computing, including processing, storage and communications, and devices that provide these functions, means that applications of digital technology no longer need to be restricted to the well-off. Inexpensive smartphones are an obvious example. This paper discusses the components of a possible successful innovation system for digital technology-based growth.

As the supply of goods and services is relatively inelastic in the short run, our arguments imply that changes to near-term demand for investment (consumption) will affect the prices of investment (consumption) goods and services. Consistent with the investment-based argument, we find that profitability changes predict investment and Producer Price Index (PPI) shifts in subsequent quarters. Our analyses also reveal that aggregate earnings growth predicts future investment and PPI forecast errors.

We document that in the year following flag removal, credit card limits increase by $780 and credit card balances increase by roughly $290, implying an “MPC out of liquidity” of 0.37. We find a significantly higher MPC during the Great Recession, with an average MPC roughly 20–30 percent larger between 2007 and 2009 compared to surrounding years.

Our first experiment replicates a negative incentive effect when insight problems require “bottom-up” divergent thinking from an unexpected resource to the problem it is uniquely equipped to solve, whereas our second experiment finds a positive incentive effect in the more general case of problems that enable “top-down” divergent thinking from a problem to multiple potential solutions. We also observe a positive incentive effect in a third experiment that measures the time needed to generate a solution to problems that have multiple potential solutions and in a fourth experiment in which participants design insight problems.

Method We conducted nine correlational and experimental studies using vignettes and recalled events ( N = 2,177). Results We find that individuals who are concerned about being seen as braggarts tend to avoid capitalizing with their close relationships even when it is likely their partner would ultimately learn of the news. Yet this concern may be relatively unwarranted and these individuals show a forecasting error: They overestimate how negatively their partner would react to disclosure and predict that their partner would react more positively if they discovered the news through external means. However,they neglect to predict that partners who later learn of the news and realize they were not disclosed toward in fact feel devalued. We discuss how this concern with bragging is linked to decreased extraversion, perspective taking, and empathy. Conclusions Uniquely in close relationships, being concerned about bragging may elicit negative relational outcomes, by hindering the positive self‐disclosures that one's partners expect.",Crossref,99.01960784313725,10.1111/jopy.12635,https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12635,Journal of Personality,,Goal 5,0.004698768791766548,False,

Our simulation study assessed the potential impact of RSS scheduling on patients recommended for same-day diagnostics.

Methods: We used a discrete event simulation to model workflow at a high-volume breast imaging center, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)-triaged same-day diagnostic workups after screening mammograms. The RSS design sequences patients in the daily screening schedule using cancer risk categories developed from Tyrer-Cuzick and deep learning model scores. We compared recall variance, required hours of operation to accommodate all patients, and patient wait times using traditional (random) and RSS schedules.

Results: The baseline simulation included 60 daily patients, with an average of 42% receiving screening mammograms and 11% (about three patients) being recommended for diagnostic workups. Compared with traditional scheduling, RSS scheduling reduces recall variance by up to 30% (1.98 versus 2.82, P < .05). With same-day diagnostics, RSS scheduling had a modest impact, increasing the number of patients served within normal operating hours by up to 1.3% (55.4 versus 54.7, P < .05), decreasing necessary operational hours by 12 min (10.3 versus 10.5 hours, P < .05), and increasing patient waiting times by an average of 2.4 min (0.24 versus 0.20 hours, P < .05).

Conclusion: Our simulation study suggests that RSS scheduling could reduce recall variance. This approach might enable same-day diagnostics using AI triage by accommodating patients within normal operating hours.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 1,0.00905401514533311,False,

Existing spectra of 22,737 sources reveals that 22,191 (97.6%) are quasars; accounting for the magnitude dependence of this efficiency, we estimate that 95,502 (95.0%) of the objects in the catalog are quasars. Such a high efficiency is unprecedented in broad-band surveys of quasars. This ``proof-of-concept'' sample is designed to be maximally efficient, but still has 94.7% completeness to unresolved, g<~19.5, UVX quasars from the DR1 quasar catalog. This efficient and complete selection is the result of our application of a probability density type analysis to training sets that describe the 4-D color distribution of stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the SDSS. Specifically, we use a non-parametric Bayesian classification, based on kernel density estimation, to parameterize the color distribution of astronomical sources -- allowing for fast and robust classification. We further supplement the catalog by providing photometric redshifts and matches to FIRST/VLA, ROSAT, and USNO-B sources. Future work needed to extend the this selection algorithm to larger redshifts, fainter magnitudes, and resolved sources is discussed.

We contend that contemporary scholarship must embrace the foundational approach in global business and strategy to consider the relevance of both efficiency and market-power effects in factoring the implications of multinational activity. We empirically test the degree to which efficiency and market-power effects manifest in a comprehensive sample of 4,370 cross-border acquisitions materializing between 1986 and 2010. Specifically, we employ three different measurement approaches to distinguish efficiency enhancing from market-power increasing cross-border acquisitions. Empirical results indicate that efficiency enhancing transactions manifest in two-thirds and market-power increasing transactions manifest in one-third of our sampled activities. Accordingly, our results affirm the literature's focus on efficiency effects, yet market-power effects are sufficiently sizable to merit scholarly attention.

Managerial Summary
Contemporary wisdom generally considers multinational activities to be characterized by efficiency properties. While it is understood that market power may manifest in multinational activity, most observers implicitly assume that anti-competitive effects are dominated by more-healthy efficiency effects. Yet, the justification behind the prior that efficiency effects dominate market-power effects is not evident, as multinational activities conceivably involve substantial market power. Accordingly, we test the received wisdom regarding the dominance of efficiency effects in an extensive sample of cross-border investments. Our empirical results affirm prevailing assumptions as efficiency enhancing transactions constitute the majority of cross-border investment activities. However, market-power increasing transactions manifest as a sizable minority of cross-border investments; thus, market-power effects should not be neglected.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 8,0.02441794294674426,False,global resource efficiency; resource efficiency

Another alternative is increased use of tolls. If these tolls are set at higher rates during rush hour, they can be most effective at reducing the worst congestion.

This paper investigates the efficacy of such systems in curbing misinformation in the context of Community Notes, a pioneering crowdsourced fact-checking system from Twitter/X. Utilizing a regression discontinuity design, we empirically identified the positive effect of publicly displaying community notes on an author’s voluntary retraction of the noted tweet, demonstrating the viability of crowdsourced fact-checking as an alternative to professional fact-checking and forcible content removal. Our findings reveal that the effect is primarily driven by the author’s reputational concern and perceived social pressure, and there is considerable heterogeneity of such effect depending on specific tweet- and user-level characteristics. Platforms, therefore, can exploit the underlying mechanism and explore the use of contextual factors to harness the full potential of crowdsourced fact-checking. Furthermore, results from discrete-time survival analyses show that publicly displaying community notes not only increases the probability of tweet retractions but also, accelerates the retraction process among retracted tweets, thereby improving platforms’ responsiveness to curb misinformation.

Evidence from a Microblogging Platform,"Gao, Yang",forthcoming,"Leveraging advancements in large language models, social media platforms are increasingly deploying sophisticated chatbots, termed social bots, with the potential to stimulate user interaction. However, concerns linger regarding the socializing value of these bots in public settings. We investigate this phenomenon using data from the launch of CommentRobot on a microblogging platform. Analyzing user interactions with this platform-owned bot, we find that posts receiving bot-generated comments experience increased user engagement, demonstrating the socializing value of social bots at the post level. Results from an online experiment confirm this finding and reveal that the socializing value stems from both bot identity and high-quality content. Mechanism tests suggest that the quality of bot-generated comments—particularly their attractiveness, relevance, and inclusion of social cues—significantly influences user engagement. Moreover, we evaluate existing bot targeting strategies and propose policy learning-based improvements to optimize engagement. Despite the positive impact on post-level engagement, we find that receiving bot comments primarily encourages future bot-related posts rather than increasing overall user posting activity, contrary to platform expectations. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on social bots and the “Computers are Social Actors” framework by empirically examining relevant constructs in a novel context.

This paper proposes a novel business model—cross-sampling through e-commerce warehouses—that e-commerce platforms with direct control over physical packages can adopt. Cross-sampling allowsphysical free samples provided by one brand (sampling brand) to be distributed with the packages of anotherunrelated brand. We demonstrate how the cross-sampling model can integrate oﬄine control and onlineinformation to commercialize the package ﬂow. In close collaboration with Alibaba, we implemented cross-sampling through a large-scale ﬁeld experiment, in which more than 55,000 free samples were distributed,to empirically examine its eﬀectiveness in driving online sales of the sampling brand. We show that cross-sampling oﬀers three distinct advantages. First, it can be implemented at a large scale with negligible cost byleveraging the existing package ﬂow. Second, it is highly eﬀective in increasing brand impressions and onlinesales of the sampling brand and acquiring new customers. Third, it utilizes both user information (online)and item information (of the package) to personalize cross-sampling. We develop an analytical framework tomonetize this information advantage of cross-sampling and quantify the value of information. Overall, cross-sampling is proven eﬀective, and the analytical framework can be applied to other opportunities, includingcross-selling and bundling across brands and categories.

Based on interviews and observation in five private sector organizations and one in the public sector, I find that executives in organizations facing crisis due to a discontinuous and unpredictable environmental change leverage management accounting during the crisis. In contrast, executives in organizations facing crisis due to a continuous and predictable environmental change question the truth and value of their management accounting practices and, as a result, do not change their use of management accounting to manage the crisis. For those organizations that do leverage management accounting, I rely on conceptual and empirical insights from the literature examining the decision-facilitating role of informal management accounting to examine how they adapt or develop new management accounting tools and practices to manage crisis. I find that executives first engage in a comprehensive review of their management accounting systems and reports to convince themselves that they can be relied on. Following this process, they leverage accounting to understand the past, develop metrics intended to reach all employees, and institute various forms of accountability to support the management of crisis.

We attribute this productivity drop to two mechanisms: reduced investment in productivity-augmenting technology, and inefficient allocation of resources across a firm’s plants.

The Role of Political Polarization in the Destigmatization of a U,"Khessina, Olga",forthcoming,"A documented recent rise in the polarization of American legislative politics underscores the question of how increasing political polarization affects organizations and industries. Yet, organizational scholars have not directed significant attention to the impact of polarization. In this paper, we demonstrate that political polarization may play an important role in organizational dynamics by revealing that polarization may expedite the destigmatization of legal yet historically stigmatized industries. To this end, we develop a theory explaining how political polarization normalizes counter-normative behavior and encourages customers to become open about their engagement with stigmatized products and organizations—a key step toward industry destigmatization. We further argue that this polarization impact may vary across regional markets because of differences in local legitimation processes that can either amplify (normative legitimacy) or attenuate (regulatory legitimacy) the effect of polarization on consumer engagement with a stigmatized industry. We find empirical evidence for our theorizing in analyses of all U.S. dispensaries of medical marijuana that existed on the online platform Weedmaps.com from its beginning in 2008 to 2014.

Our historiographical analysis of three crises from the history of legendary photo agency Magnum Photos indicates that to address this challenge, an organization may engage in continuous mythmaking based on organizational legacy, which we refer to as mythopoeic relation to legacy. Mythopoeic relation to legacy emerges from members’ beliefs in (a) the importance of the organization’s legacy, (b) the organization’s unique capabilities to further this legacy, and (c) the organization’s “miraculous” persistence despite adversities. During crises that challenge one of its high-priority values, mythopoeic relation to legacy triggers the switch from the ethic of conviction for this value to the ethic of responsibility for the whole system, enabling the organization to weave the episode of value violation seamlessly into the fabric of its myth, thus ensuring the continuity of organizational legacy. We refer to this positive loop, whereby crisis triggers mythopoeic relation to legacy, which in its turn helps overcome the crisis, as mastering the art of crisis.

If a firm obtains an extremely high profit margin relative to their surplus, consumers are less likely to purchase from this firm. A salient feature of such industries, however, is that firms commonly enjoy decreasing costs per unit with increasing cumulative output. This paper examines how the coexistence of consumer fairness concerns and decreasing costs impacts price competition among firms. Prior literature suggests that both consumer fairness concerns and scale economies heighten price competition. We show, however, that firms may set higher prices and obtain greater profit with stronger consumer fairness concerns in the presence of declining costs, because the indirect effect that consumer fairness concerns soften price competition caused by cost reductions may dominate the direct effect that they intensify price competition caused by product substitution. Furthermore, we show the robustness of our results by considering various situations, such as a general cost-reduction function, information asymmetry between consumers and firms, heterogeneity in consumers’ knowledge of firms’ cost structures, consumer heterogeneity in fairness concerns, and endogenous fairness concerns.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 12,0.01005412867164042,False,

In contrast, in collectivistic cultures (and particularly horizontal ones that promote egalitarianism), power is conceptualized in socialized terms (i.e. focus on benefitting others), warmth and competence drive status attainment, norm adherence increases power, and individuals strive primarily for status, approve of powerholders that behave compassionately, and feel happy when they have socialized power.

This research provides a solution to this problem—“value instantiation,” which encourages people to generate reasons for a value and to pursue it via a concrete example. We introduce the following two approaches for instantiating self-transcendence values in the context of self-enhancement value pursuit: (1) exposing consumers to philanthropic activities of self-enhancement-driven celebrities (study 1) and (2) encouraging consumers to visualize themselves engaging in philanthropic activities while pursuing self-enhancement values (study 2).

Results from seven studies demonstrate that consumers experiencing cultural distinctiveness are likely to evaluate favorably and prefer brands associated with a related cultural group, in a choice set or consumption situation, even if they are not the favored option in the choice set. This pro-in-group bias for culturally related brands is driven by a heightened desire to connect with “home,” which prompts consumers to expand their in-group boundaries to include the related cultural group within a broadened definition of home. However, this pro-in-group bias is attenuated when the salience of intergroup rivalries is high, where experiencing cultural distinctiveness can backfire and result in less favorable evaluations of brands associated with a related cultural group.

Results from two studies show that young, educated Chinese consumers who are highly biculturated (i.e., knowledgeable about Western and Chinese cultures) tend to integrate the autonomy values associated with a phonosemantic brand translation, which in turn lead them to evaluate more favorably culturally mixed phonosemantic (vs. monocultural semantic or phonetic) brand translations. At the individual level, favorable attitudes toward culture mixing are more likely to emerge among individuals with a higher (vs. lower) endorsement of autonomy values.

Social,"Tyagi, Hanu",2020,"In February 2017, India capped the retail price of coronary stents and restricted the channel margin to bring Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) procedure, which uses coronary stents, within reach of millions of patients who previously could not afford it. Prior research shows that care providers respond to such regulations in a way that compensates for their loss in profits because of price control. Therefore, price control policies often introduce unintended consequences, such as distortions in clinical decision making. We investigate such distortions through empirical analysis of claims data from a representative public insurance program in the Indian state of Karnataka. Our data comprises 25,769 insurance claims from 69 private and seven public hospitals from February 2016 to February 2018. The public insurance context is ideal for investigating distortions in clinical decisions as the price paid by patients, and thereby access to the treatment, does not change after price control. We find that the change in the average volume of PTCA procedures per hospital per month after price control disproportionately increased when compared to the change in the clinical alternative – Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) procedures. This increase corresponds to 6% of the average number of PTCA procedures and 28% of the average number of CABG procedures before the price control. In addition, disproportionate increase in PTCA procedures occurred only among private hospitals, indicating the possibility of profit-maximization intentions driving the clinical choices. Such clinical distortions can have negative implications for patient health outcomes in the long run.

Consistent with the conjecture that deferrals benefit from lower litigation costs that inhibit insider trading before the release of corporate news, we also find that deferral amounts are significantly higher (lower) before the disclosure of good (bad) earnings news.

To test our hypothesis, we conduct a quasi-field experiment at two facilities of a manufacturing company for fourteen months.

In Study 3 (N = 320), participants rated whether moral scenarios involved harm or victims prior to (vs. after) moral judgments.

In this study, we examine the product type (virtue vs. vice) as well as the purchase context (retailer: Target vs. Walmart). Using an online experiment with U.S. consumers (N = 605), we determine how the organic label interacts with each of these contexts and how these interactions impact downstream evaluations such as expected taste, nutrition, safety, likelihood of purchase, and attitude and trust toward the product’s brand. Results of the study reveal both the organic label and retail context impact product evaluations. First, results showed organic products were perceived more favorably on a number of measures (including nutrition, safety, brand attitude, and brand trust) than their non-organic counterparts, providing evidence of an organic “halo” effect. Interestingly, though, the organic “halo” did not extend to two measures: expected taste and likelihood of purchase. Secondly, organic labeling benefits virtue and vice products in distinct aspects – the organic virtue product had better expected taste while the organic vice product had higher expected nutrition.

Risk assessments for a client using a product differentiation strategy are compared with assessments made for a client using an operational excellence strategy. The focus is on hypotheses for judgments of process-specific business risk and the risk of material misstatement (RMM) of revenue. Business risk is the risk that a process will not produce the level of effectiveness necessary to achieve one or more entity-level strategic objectives (Bell, Peecher, & Solomon, 2002). Graduate accounting students with auditing experience demonstrated significant understanding of the predicted relationships. With a few exceptions, they (1) produced process-specific business risk judgments that are positively associated with RMM judgments for the critical processes of the product differentiation strategy, and not for the non-critical processes; (2) generated process-specific judgments of business risk that mediated the association of Production process performance and the RMM of revenue; and, (3) when the three product generation processes were performing less well, correctly assessed the highest RMM of revenue.

They were randomly assigned to post a comment after reading a series of either all positive or all negative reviews of a branded product. We coded participants’ comments based on their preexisting attitude towards the product brand and grouped the participants into five behavioral types: 1) vocal and silent (normative) majorities (n = 235), 2) silent minorities (n = 75), 3) social conformers (n = 117), 4) vocal minorities (n = 95), and 5) “online trolls” (n = 46). Both vocal minorities and “online trolls” explicitly expressed opposition to the majority opinion, but the “trolls” spoke out against the majority opinion against their own beliefs. Based on past research, we identified Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism as the set of personality markers that might differentiate the trolls from the vocal minorities. Our results were mixed. As expected, the “online trolls’ scored the highest on psychopathy and sadism among all the behavioral types. However, the trolls were not distinguishable from the vocal minorities on the psychopathy trait.

If searching the internet via search engine leads people to conflate digital information as self-produced, what happens when features of our devices turn information search into an interpersonal situation? The proliferation of anthropomorphic technology underpinned by artificial intelligence (AI) may challenge the current view of search-induced cognitive overconfidence. In two experiments, we investigate how using digital agents to search for information moderates the misattribution of online information to one’s own memory. We find that, in contrast to using a search engine, using a digital agent to access online information does not lead to higher estimations of cognitive self-esteem (Experiment 1). Moreover, using a humanized digital agent may lead to lower cognitive self-esteem than using a non-humanized digital agent or thinking alone (Experiment 2). Whereas internet searches can make people overconfident in their cognitive abilities, accessing information through a conversational digital agent appears to clarify boundaries between internal and external knowledge.

Our goal is to supplement prevailing explanations of these tasks (e.g., general intelligence and job knowledge) with this executive functioning lens.

These findings suggest that both content categories are related to the neural basis of social cognition; further, several areas in the default mode network (DMN) showed similar deactivations between agency and communion, reflecting task-induced deactivation (TID). In terms of distinct activations, the findings indicated greater deactivations for communal than agentic content in the ventral anterior cingulate (vACC) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Communion also showed greater activation in some visual areas compared to agentic content, including occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. These activations may reflect greater allocation of attentional resources to visual areas when processing communal content, or inhibition of cognitive activity irrelevant to task performance.

Built entirely on publicly available financial signals-including firm-level equity prices, macroeconomic indicators, and sector ETFs-the framework replaces rigid taxonomies with a flexible, behaviorally revealed peer selection mechanism governed by coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and speed-weighted Runge-Kutta integration. A stakeholder-aware thresholding scheme integrates strategic priorities without sacrificing analytical rigor. The resulting industry index is constructed using Self-Financing Hierarchical Risk Parity (SF-HRP), producing stable and interpretable portfolio weights. A Gram-Schmidt orthogonality ensures parsimony among macroeconomic factors (|ρ| < 0.05), enhancing robustness. Forecasting evaluations confirm that CNN-LSTM achieves superior performance (RMSE: 0.028, R²: 0.95), reducing error by over 80% relative to baseline LSTM models, while WGANs capture tail risk distributions (R²: 0.75).

It is argued that the color red has the capability to induce arousal, which in turn has been shown to enhance a person's default tendencies. Further, because high sensation seekers have a higher tendency to react, the exposure to the color red for these individuals will increase reactance and thereby non-compliant behavior. One field study and two lab experiments provide support for this theorizing. The first experiment, a field study, examines prank-chatting incidences at a child helpline and shows a positive effect of red on such non-compliant behavior.

Towards a theory of MNCs' sociopolitical activism in host countries,"Minefee, Ishva",forthcoming,"With multinational corporations (MNCs) increasingly taking public stances on sociopolitical issues such as immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, and racism, it is imperative that international business (IB) research keeps pace with normative societal debates. In this paper, we introduce the concept of corporate sociopolitical activism (SPA) to the IB literature and develop a theory on why MNCs consistently or inconsistently engage in SPA in response to the same issue in their home country and a host country. We theorize that institutional complexity at three levels of analysis – within a host country, between home and host countries, and beyond the home and host countries – shapes MNCs’ decisions. This paper contributes to the IB literature by situating SPA as a new area within international nonmarket strategy research. In addition, we extend IB research on institutional complexity by theorizing how heterogeneity within a host country influences MNCs’ behaviors. We also expand the focus of the literature on corporate SPA from domestic firms to MNCs. Overall, this paper represents a call to action for IB researchers to examine MNCs’ responses to sociopolitical issues in an increasingly polarized world.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 10,0.01683793446905676,False,

First, sharing economy offerings are often crowdsourced from a wide range of providers rather than a single firm. Second, these offerings are typically temporarily accessed rather than permanently owned. The effect of these two characteristics on how offerings are exchanged has generated considerable interest from scholars across a wide range of domains, including economics, management, and marketing. However, little is known about the impact of the sharing economy (and crowdsourced provision and temporary access), upon the way offerings are created. As a result, the degree to which innovation in the sharing economy differs from how it is typically conducted is largely unknown. Our research seeks to address this question. Specifically, we begin by reviewing the literature on innovation in the sharing economy and then offer a conceptual framework that focuses on the role of crowdsourced provision and temporary access within the innovation process. We then assess this framework by examining innovations introduced by Uber since its inception. In addition, we explore the degree to which sharing platforms differ from a typical profit maximizing firm by conducting an econometric analysis of the price differences between Uber and a traditional taxi service.

During crises, nonprofit organizations have historically played a crucial role in mitigating these challenges, with crowdfunding platforms emerging as a new solution for resource mobilization. In this study, we examine how individual and institutional donors respond to the sudden shifts in demand that accompany a global crisis. We analyze rich, granular data from multiple sources, including donation data from a leading education crowdfunding platform, before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and find notable contrasts between individual and institutional responses. While there was a significant increase in institutional donations during the pandemic, individual donations remained relatively stable overall. Adopting a motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework, we center donor heterogeneity in our approach, deriving nuanced insights. Donations from individuals in economically disadvantaged communities, which were the worst impacted by the crisis, decreased; however, these communities prioritized immediate and time-sensitive needs. Small and local institutions played a pivotal role in supporting high-need schools during the crisis. These findings make meaningful contributions to the operations literature on crowdfunding and have practical implications for platform designers. By distinguishing between individual and institutional donors and identifying the factors that drive their behavior, our study offers important implications for platform designers to improve crisis-time resource mobilization through more targeted engagement strategies.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 4,0.02803717942994768,False,school infrastructure

Firms often attempt to influence media channels to showcase their climate action initiatives, aiming to enhance their public image, reputation, and stakeholder trust. While firms cannot directly control their media coverage, intentional or unintentional dissemination of their climate action efforts can thrust them into the media spotlight. The implications of this media spotlight remain uncertain. While firms may anticipate positive public relations benefits from such exposure, it may also raise environmental expectations for firms and risk highlighting less favorable aspects of their environmental practices. Despite previous research on the impact of media exposure on firms’ financial outcomes, a notable gap exists in understanding how the media spotlight on firms’ climate actions affects their operational and financial performance. A clear hurdle is the lack of a systematic and objective measurement of such a spotlight. Our study addresses this research gap by developing a machine learning-based framework to derive a climate action vocabulary as a novel information artifact. The vocabulary is subsequently used to measure the intensity of media attention on a firm's climate actions. Our research reveals that an increased media spotlight on climate actions, regardless of their sentiment, has an adverse effect on firms’ financial performance, primarily due to the rise in operational costs. Furthermore, we find that the impact of media spotlight is heterogeneous. Low-polluting firms experience negative financial consequences as the downside of the heightened media spotlight. In contrast, high-polluting firms and those operating in polluting industries may witness an overall positive financial impact. We also find that firms’ market orientation (business-to-business vs. business-to-consumer), durability classification, index constituency (i.e., S&P 500), and greenwashing status significantly moderate the relationship. Our research highlights key considerations for corporate leaders with respect to the drawbacks for low-polluting firms in seeking media attention for their climate actions. Given that the media captures society's limited attention, our research suggests that firms should refrain from promoting superficial narratives about climate change that distract society from more impactful sustainability conversations.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 13,0.220225354400761,True,climate action; climate finance; global climate action; institutional capacity for climate action; public awareness on climate

Producers of information strive for visibility among consumers who have limited attention. Corporate websites are a primary digital marketing channel for firms through which they seek to gain a bigger share of their stakeholders' (i.e., customers, investors, communities) attention. Using observations spanning several years we study the website visibility, as measured by user traffic, of more than 2500 public firms and its association with properties of corporate websites and the corresponding firms. One property that is of particular interest to us is the availability of “community-engaging” pages, i.e., pages that support blogs or forums on the website or provide links to external social media platforms such as Facebook. These community-engaging pages signify online prosocial services provided by firms. We find that websites with larger number of community-engaging pages are associated with higher visibility. This provides a novel empirical support for the promotion and use of social media content and tools on websites of firms. We also find that websites with more specific content are associated with lower visibility while providing more out-links is associated with higher visibility. We observe these results consistently over time.

However, since prior research has mainly focused upon improvisation within organizations, little is known about alliance-level improvisation or how it impacts new product development. Drawing on a broad set of literatures, we also propose that firms participating in alliances often align with partners that possess similar skills, lack a shared history, and place importance on external threats. We propose that these characteristics influence both the incidence and impact of improvisation within new product alliances. We test the effect of these three characteristics upon the incidence of improvisation in an initial study of 106 U.S. firms engaged in new product alliances. We then examine the degree to which these three characteristics moderate the impact of alliance improvisation upon new product performance via a follow-up study among 54 of these firms. We find that improvisation is more likely to occur when alliance partners lack relational experience but share similar skills. Furthermore, the impact of alliance improvisation on new product performance is enhanced when alliance partners possess similar skills, share relational experience, and place low importance on external threats. We then seek to replicate our findings in a third study involving 252 U.S. firms recently engaged in new product alliances, and also spotlight a few other drivers of alliance improvisation, including skill complementarity, shared governance, and cultural fit.

We establish the optimality to change the price from low to high in each replenishment cycle as inventory is depleted. With costly price adjustment, scale economies of inventory replenishment are reflected in the cycle time instead of lot size -- An increased fixed ordering cost leads to an extended replenishment cycle but does not necessarily increase the order quantity. A reduced marginal cost of ordering calls for an increased order quantity, as well as speeding up product selling within a cycle. We derive useful properties of the profit function that allows for reducing computational complexity of the problem. For systems requiring short replenishment cycles, the optimal solution can be easily computed by applying these properties. For systems requiring long replenishment cycles, we further consider a relaxed problem that is computational tractable. Under this relaxation, the sum of fixed ordering cost and price adjustment cost is equal to (greater than, less than) the total inventory holding cost within a replenishment cycle when the inventory holding cost is linear (convex, concave) in the stock level. Moreover, under the optimal solution, the time-average profit is the same across all price segments when the inventory holding cost is accounted properly. Through a numerical study, we demonstrate that inventory-based dynamic pricing can lead to significant profit improvement compared with static pricing and limited price adjustment can yield a benefit that is close to unlimited price adjustment. To be able to enjoy the benefit of dynamic pricing, however, it is important to appropriately choose inventory levels at which the price is revised.",Crossref,100.0,10.2139/ssrn.2479011,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2479011,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Goal 12,0.009443925603163239,False,

Founders lacking organizational misalignment motives generally founded initial ventures that failed: however, those making internal attributions altered their behaviors and built successful careers; in contrast, founders making external attributions continued founding unsuccessful ventures.

This review bridges previously isolated research communities by synthesizing knowledge on “employee mobility barriers”—mechanisms that restrict employee movement and help firms maintain human capital-based competitive advantages. We introduce a typology of ten categories of employee mobility barriers, differentiated by level of analysis (individual, organizational, societal) and degree of firm control, to organize the disparate literature on this topic. Building on this foundation, we propose an architecture of strategic modes that characterizes firm responses to employee mobility barriers based on the level of firm control (high vs. low) and the level at which barriers operate (individual vs. organizational). This framework offers a theoretical lens for understanding how firms navigate these barriers through proactive and reactive strategies, highlighting implications for decision-making, centralization, and delegation. Our review examines the dual nature of employee mobility as both an opportunity and a challenge for firms and individuals, with implications across three primary domains: individual careers, human capital/human resource management (HC/HRM), and strategic management. We propose a portfolio perspective for future research to explore whether different mobility barriers act as complements or substitutes. Additionally, we consider the relational benefits of employee mobility and suggest directions for further inquiry. By integrating our typology and the architecture of strategic modes, this review advances theoretical and practical understanding of employee mobility barriers, reflecting recent developments and setting the stage for future research.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 11,0.01298671126240064,False,

Unfortunately, this is not always true, and some very unexpected taxable transactions may result from the distribution of money or property from the partnership.

Consistent with flowthrough entity treatment, taxes on partnership income are paid by partners as the income is earned, regardless of whether any income is distributed. As a result, any eventual property and/or monetary distributions, except for excess money distribution as discussed below, from a partnership generally do not create taxable income to the recipient partner.

However, multiple exceptions can create taxable income causing taxpayers problems when they are not adequately planned for, such as contributions of liabilities to a partnership or changes in the terms of a liability.

Each of the following can result in the creation of taxable income for the recipient partner, and in some cases the partnership itself will have taxable income that will flow through to the partners, even to partners who are not receiving a distribution:",Crossref,100.0,10.2307/1335486,https://doi.org/10.2307/1335486,Harvard Law Review,,Goal 10,0.02658204051846703,False,

Using data collected from 185 outsourcing agreements from a leading global vendor of IT services, we analyze several service quality drivers in terms of their relationship to overall satisfaction. We find that delivery of services within the originally estimated costs is the key driver that can elevate customers from being dissatisfied to satisfied. The results also suggest that the key service quality driver that moves satisfied customers toward higher levels of satisfaction is the vendor's dedicated adherence to the terms of the service level agreement.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,,,,Goal 17,0.02429761856712537,False,

Such teams have the ability to dynamically change their shape, form, hierarchy, and other properties, making these structures an attractive approach to teaming for large organizations.

While STSAs have been recognized as a valuable addition to business degree curricula, there are some understandable concerns about time constraints limiting the length of learning activities and possibly jeopardizing the program's academic rigor. We analyzed two editions of a week-long program of a leading Mexican university, covering international business topics in Europe. In particular, we centered our research on the students' perceived value with a balance of experiential activities and lecturing from academic experts. We found that more rigorous and academically loaded programs lead to higher student satisfaction.

As competitive environments globalize, the dynamic capabilities driven by managers with multicultural backgrounds are increasingly relevant. These managers are more likely to seize cognitively distant opportunities than monocultural managers. Using panel analysis of multilevel data from 355 elite football (soccer) teams, we find support for a moderated relationship among the degree of globalization in the competitive environment, the multicultural background of team managers, and team performance. When the competitive environment is highly global, teams with multicultural managers outperform teams with monocultural managers. When the competitive environment is less global, the reverse is true.

Understanding how clients choose among professional services firms for tax services is important both because of the economic significance of tax service revenues to public accounting firms and because of regulatory changes to the market for tax services following the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Because public accounting firms compete with law and consulting firms for tax clients, we examine whether factors that influence the organizational structure of professions – client proximity and knowledge availability – influence clients’ decisions to purchase tax services. Using data from the U.S. NFP sector where the decision to purchase tax services is observable for all organizations, we find that NFPs are less likely to retain their auditor for tax services as distance to the auditor and knowledge availability increase. We document that self-preparing NFPs are more likely to misreport executive compensation on their return, and we find no differences in misreporting between auditor and non-auditor paid preparers. Finally, we find that NFPs receive lower donor contributions after changing from paid preparers to self-preparing the Form 990.",Crossref,100.0,10.2139/ssrn.4096279,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4096279,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Goal 1,0.02101241305405569,False,

We believe this is a good time to take stock of the impact of globalization on businesses (especially on positioning and marketing strategies) and consumers’ responses. The aim of this monograph is to provide an overview of globalization as a phenomenon that affects business activities and consumer behavior. Upon providing a brief history of globalization and identifying the key aspects of its conceptualization, we review the impact on the emergence of a global consumer culture, the positioning and marketing strategies adopted by firms, the reactions of consumers to globalization itself (i.e., their attitudes toward it and their identity shifts) and to the diversity of products and services available in a global marketplace, and the idiosyncratic ways in which globalization affects some key industries (e.g., technology, consumer goods, and media and entertainment) and countries.

Results were robust and emerged for a variety of product categories and brands. Furthermore, results from a lab experiment demonstrate that, compared to brands that embody consumers’ ongoing value priorities, those that additionally embody non-prioritized values associated with an ideal self induce feelings of self-expansion, which in turn leads to more favorable consumer responses to brands.

Our review shows that culture affects how status and power are conceptualized, who attains them, and what their consequences are. In individualistic cultures (and particularly vertical ones that emphasize hierarchical arrangements), power is conceptualized in personalized terms (i.e. focus on self-benefits), competence drives status attainment, norm violations increase power, and individuals strive primarily for power, approve of powerholders that behave equitably, and feel happy when they have personal power. In contrast, in collectivistic cultures (and particularly horizontal ones that promote egalitarianism), power is conceptualized in socialized terms (i.e. focus on benefitting others), warmth and competence drive status attainment, norm adherence increases power, and individuals strive primarily for status, approve of powerholders that behave compassionately, and feel happy when they have socialized power.
