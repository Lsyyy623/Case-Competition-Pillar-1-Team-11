Advances in the rural/household sector, encompassing the majority of the population and typically reliant on traditional fuels, are based on a unique combination of off-grid solar home systems for lighting and improved cook stoves for cleaner cooking, and heating, with significant domestic technology, innovation, and entrepreneurial contents. For the urban/industrial/commercial sector, currently based primarily on the country¡¯s dwindling gas reserve, energy planners have adopted the classical centralized generation and distribution system common in the West, with two seemingly contradictory approaches, reliance on imported coal and liquefied natural gas proffered for a rapid economic expansion, and utility-scale, ¡®clean¡¯ electricity generation with a smattering of nuclear plants and solar farms in order to meet the country¡¯s commitment to the Paris climate treaty. Both approaches rely on external technology, expertise, and concepts. The paper gives a historic perspective on the country¡¯s often painful and environmentally damaging efforts to augment her meagre access to modern energy resources mainly for the urban/industrial/commercial energy sector, provides an overview of energy growth plans for this sector, and describes the remarkable progress in the hitherto neglected rural/household sector. The paper then notes, how the lessons from the historical perspective and the experience in the rural/household energy sector taken together, can inform development of a unique homegrown approach for the urban/industrial/commercial energy sector to fit the country¡¯s economic aspirations, terrain and, societal needs, instead of the current approach being pursued.",Crossref,99.9908977,10.1163/27715086-02002007,https://doi.org/10.1163/27715086-02002007,2018,Journal of Bangladesh Studies,ok,CR-biblio:Badruzzaman 2018 Bangladesh Energy/Climate Nexus Part I: Quest for Energy Fix and Trailblazing Rural/Household Energy Se,Bangladesh Energy/Climate Nexus Part I Quest for Energy Fix and a Trailblazing Rural/Household Energy Sector,10.1163/27715086-02002007,,Goal 7,0.270843024,TRUE,affordable energy; clean energy adoption; clean energy infrastructure; clean energy investment; energy access in developing countries; energy demand; energy for agriculture; energy for business; energy infrastructure; energy infrastructure development; energy innovation; energy policy; energy poverty; energy research; energy sector investment; energy sector reform; international energy cooperation; least developed countries energy; modern energy access; modern energy services; renewable energy; sustainable energy; sustainable energy systems

Management Science.",2024,Getting Down to Business: Chain Ownership and Fertility Clinic Performance,"Acquisitions by corporate entities have fueled the growth of chain organizations in healthcare. A chain is a multiunit firm under the same ownership and management providing similar services in different locations. Chain ownership has been credited with boosting firm performance in the retail and service sectors but has been criticized for prioritizing profits over the well-being of patients in the healthcare sector. This paper finds that chain ownership improves healthcare outcomes in the market for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Using novel data on U.S. fertility clinics and difference-in-differences methods, we find that IVF cycles increase by 27.2%, and IVF success rates increase by 13.6% after acquisition by a fertility chain. We provide evidence that fertility chains facilitate resource and knowledge transfers needed to enhance quality and expand the IVF market. For example, acquired clinics change IVF processes and procedures to achieve the IVF gold standard of simultaneously reducing higher-risk multiple births and increasing singleton births. We discuss how the fertility sector¡¯s relatively minimal market frictions and information asymmetries may incentivize chain owners to invest in quality.

The welfare consequences of this behavior depend on how firms use the marginal windfall dollar, yet little evidence exists to guide policymakers. This paper studies how hospitals allocated over $3 billion obtained from gaming a Medicare payment loophole. The average gaming hospital increased both Medicare and total revenue by around 10%, implying large spillovers on other payers. Consistent with theories of organizational behavior, nonprofit hospitals deployed most of the windfall toward operating costs, while for-profits deducted the entire amount off their balance sheet, distributing a substantial portion to executives and shareholders. Accordingly, we detect modest reductions in mortality rates at nonprofits but no changes at for-profits.

Management Science.",2022,The Impact of Management on Clinical Performance: Evidence from Physician Practice Management Companies,"Mergers and acquisitions in healthcare are increasingly leading to changes in firm management. This paper studies how a change in firm management impacts clinical performance using data on an understudied phenomenon: medical practice acquisitions by physician practice management companies (PPMCs). PPMCs market themselves as offloading the administrative burden of running a medical practice without compromising physician autonomy over clinical decisions. However, a PPMC¡¯s management strategy and practices, such as performance monitoring and financial incentives, could influence physician behavior. For example, some PPMCs advertise increasing revenue through better financial management, whereas others also advertise improving quality through better clinical management. In this paper, I collect data on three large PPMCs that manage the practices of more than 40% of obstetricians and gynecologists (Ob-Gyns) in Florida between 2006 and 2014. An Ob-Gyn¡¯s main clinical decision in childbirth involves a tradeoff between financial and clinical outcomes: cesarean sections (C-sections) are often more highly reimbursed than vaginal births but pose risks to maternal and infant health when not medically necessary. Using difference-in-differences methods, I find heterogeneous effects on C-sections depending on a PPMC¡¯s publicized management strategy. Physicians acquired by PPMCs that focus on financial management increase the use of C-sections, resulting in less clinically appropriate care and worse patient outcomes. The opposite result is found when PPMCs focus on clinical management. I provide qualitative and quantitative evidence that differences in firm management are the most likely driver of changes in C-sections.

Physician management companies (PMCs), often backed by private equity (PE), are increasingly providing staffing and management services to health care facilities, yet little is known of their influence on prices.


Objective
To study changes in prices paid to practitioners (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists) before and after an outpatient facility contracted with a PMC.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This retrospective cohort study used difference-in-differences methods to compare price changes before and after a facility contracted with a PMC with facilities that did not and to compare differences between PMCs with and without PE investment. Commercial claims data (2012-2017) from 3 large national insurers in the Health Care Cost Institute database were combined with a novel data set of PMC facility contracts to identify prices paid to anesthesia practitioners in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers. The cohort included 2992 facilities that never contracted with a PMC and 672 facilities that contracted with a PMC between 2012 and 2017, collectively representing 2?255?933 anesthesia claims.


Exposures
Temporal variation in facility-level exposure to PMC contracts for anesthesia services.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Main outcomes were (1) allowed amounts and the unit price (allowed amounts standardized per unit of service) paid to anesthesia practitioners; and (2) the probability that a practitioner was out of network.


Results
From before to after the PMC contract period, allowed amounts increased by 16.5% (+$116.39; 95% CI, $76.11 to $156.67; P?<?.001), and the unit price increased by 18.7% (+$18.79; 95% CI, $12.73 to $24.84; P?<?.001) in PMC facilities relative to non-PMC facilities. Results did not show evidence that anesthesia practitioners were moved out of network (+2.25; 95% CI, -2.56 to 7.06; P?<?.36). In subsample analyses, PMCs without PE investment increased allowed amounts by 12.9% (+$89.88; 95% CI, $42.07 to $137.69; P?<?.001), while PE-backed PMCs (representing half of the PMCs in the sample) increased allowed amounts by 26.0% ($187.06; 95% CI, $133.59 to $240.52; P?<?.001). Similar price increases were observed for unit prices.


Conclusions and Relevance
In this cohort study, prices paid to anesthesia practitioners increased after hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers contracted with a PMC and were substantially higher if the PMC received PE investment. This research provides insights into the role of corporate ownership in health care relevant to policy makers, payers, practitioners, and patients.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100,10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.0004,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b94178dbcf649d7cdbaf82b295d607677034f30,2022,JAMA Internal Medicine,ok,CR-biblio:La Forgia 2022 Association of Physician Management Companies and Private Equity Investment With Commercial Health Care P,Association of Physician Management Companies and Private Equity Investment With Commercial Health Care Prices Paid to Anesthesia Practitioners,10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.0004,,Goal 3,0.040706871,FALSE,

Several states have passed surprise-billing legislation to protect patients from unanticipated out-of-network medical bills, yet little is known about how state laws influence out-of-network prices and whether spillovers exist to in-network prices.


Objective
To identify any changes in prices paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities and to in-network anesthesiologists before and after states passed surprise-billing legislation.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This retrospective economic analysis used difference-in-differences methods to compare price changes before and after the passage of legislation in California, Florida, and New York, which passed comprehensive surprise-billing legislation between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017, to 45 states that did not. Commercial claims data from the Health Care Cost Institute were used to identify prices paid to anesthesiologists in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers. The final analytic sample comprised 2?713?913 anesthesia claims across the 3 treated states and the 45 control states.


Exposures
Temporal and state-level variation in exposure to surprise-billing legislation.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The unit price (allowed amounts standardized per unit of service) paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities and to in-network anesthesiologists.


Results
This retrospective economic analysis of 2 713 913 anesthesia claims found that after surprise-billing laws were passed in 3 states, the unit price paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities decreased significantly in 2 of them: California, -$12.71 (95% CI, -$25.70 to -$0.27; P?=?.05) and Florida, -$35.67 (95% CI, -$46.27 to -$25.07; P?<?.001). In New York, a decline in the overall out-of-network price was not statistically significant (-$7.91; 95% CI, -$17.48 to -$1.68; P?=?.10); however, by the fourth quarter of 2017, the decline was -$41.28 (95% CI, -$70.24 to -$12.33; P?=?.01). In-network prices decreased in California by -$10.68 (95% CI, -$12.70 to -$8.66; P?<?.001); in Florida, -$3.18 (95% CI, -$5.17 to -$1.19; P?=?.002); and in New York, -$8.05 (95% CI, -$11.46 to -$4.64; P?<?.001).


Conclusions and Relevance
This retrospective study found that prices paid to in-network and out-of-network anesthesiologists in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers decreased after the introduction of surprise-billing legislation, providing early insights into how prices may change under the federal No Surprises Act and in states that have recently passed their own legislation.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100,10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.4564,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b73fa4a595ad4ca28757897e0787bb8d7eed070b,2021,JAMA Internal Medicine,ok,CR-biblio:La Forgia 2021 Association of Surprise Billing Legislation with Prices Paid to In-Network and Out-of-Network Anesthesiol,"Association of Surprise-Billing Legislation with Prices Paid to In-Network and Out-of-Network Anesthesiologists in California, Florida, and New York",10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.4564,,Goal 9,0.01732323,FALSE,

Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is often considered a common cause of mental status changes, particularly in elderly patients and patients with a primary psychiatric condition. Additionally, the presence of genitourinary symptoms is essential to confirm diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment course. Patients with a communication barrier may be unable to clearly convey the presence or absence of genitourinary symptoms, complicating an accurate diagnosis when mental status changes occur. Little evidence exists on diagnosing UTIs in patients who cannot communicate genitourinary symptoms; however, some guidance in long-term care facilities suggests assessing specific symptoms that do not rely on patient report. Objectives: The primary objective of this project is to provide assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in patients who cannot communicate genitourinary symptoms through the creation of an algorithm. Secondary objectives include reducing inappropriate antibiotic use and increasing symptom documentation in this patient population. Methods: A UTI treatment algorithm for noncommunicative patients was developed using existing literature and through extensive collaboration with physicians, PhDs, and pharmacists working in the fields of emergency medicine, geriatric psychiatry, infectious diseases, microbiology, and urology. The final algorithm included comprehensive information on evaluating urinalysis (UA) results and identifying UTI symptoms, and offered guidance for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration. Educational materials were created to enforce the most appropriate use of this algorithm, and provider education is ongoing. To limit the initial scope and allow for preintervention and postintervention data analysis, the algorithm will be utilized within the psychiatric emergency department. Adults admitted to the psychiatry service with a UA ordered and collected in the emergency department as well as an ICD-10 code representing dementia, delirium, autism spectrum disorder, or developmental delay will be included. Pregnant patients will be excluded. Outcomes: The preintervention cohort includes 56 admissions. Patients are predominantly female, with an average age of 60 years. Provider education will be completed in January, with postintervention data collection and analysis completed in February. This timeline allows for reporting on the impact of the intervention by comparing changes in UA ordering, antibiotic prescribing, and symptom documentation between preintervention and postintervention cohorts.

The BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism may affect the expression and stability of BDNF, but its relationship with cognitive performance in the context of antidepressant medications in psychosis has not been examined. Objective: This study investigated the moderation of BDNF Val66Met genotype on the relationship between antidepressant use and cognitive performance in clinically stable patients with psychotic disorders. Methods: Participants (total N1?4640) with schizophrenia spectrum (n1?4428) and psychotic bipolar disorder (n1?4212) from the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) study were examined. Regression-based moderation analyses were conducted to investigate interactions between Val66Met genotype and antidepressant use in relation to cognitive performance assessed by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Results: Val66Met genotypes (Val/Val1?4474, Val/Met1?4 150, Met/Met1?4 16) did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P1?4.32). BACS scores did not significantly differ across genotype or antidepressant status groups before accounting for interactions with Val66Met genotype. In patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, Val66Met genotype significantly moderated the relationship between antidepressant use and composite BACS scores (F(1,422)1?48.426, P1?4.004), whereby there was no association between antidepressant use and composite BACS scores in Val/Val genotype groups while among Met allele carriers, a lower composite BACS score was associated with antidepressant use. Among BACS subtests, Verbal Memory and Digit Sequencing were most associated with antidepressants moderated by Val66Met genotype. Examining the influence of depression (MADRS) or psychosis (PANSS) symptoms did not change these findings. This relationship was not detected in psychotic bipolar disorder. Conclusions: The Val66Met polymorphism known to influence BDNF gene expression and stability may moderate the impact of antidepressant use on cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. These findings indicate that genetic factors related to neuroplasticity may be important determinants of drug action, and they explain interpatient differences that have been previously observed in antidepressant effects on cognitive performance. Innovative Practices Award Finalists Interdisciplinary Implementation of Mental Health Screenings and Treatment in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Clinic at a Federal Health Care Center Eileen Mintz, PharmD; Roberta Dume, PharmD; Robin Hieber, PharmD, BCPP; Suzanne Molino, PharmD, BCPS 1 Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center; 2 College of Pharmacy, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science Abstract Type: Innovative Practices. Background: Prevalence rates for mental health disorders are high among patients with HIV, with around 35% of patients and 49% of veterans having comorbid depression. Nonadherence is the primary reason for treatment failure among those infected with HIV, and depression is a barrier to adherence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Additionally, depression has been linked to poor attendance to HIV clinic appointments, accelerated clinical progression of HIV, and higher mortality rates. Therefore, identifying and treating patients with coexisting mental health conditions, especially depression, can help to improve adherence and prevent treatment failure. Description of Innovative Service: The service takes place in an HIV clinic at a federal health care center starting October 2018. It involves the clinical pharmacy specialist or pharmacy resident providing depression screenings using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) on one day of clinic. Those screened positive are further evaluated, and based on the individualized scores and other clinical factors are either referred to mental health services or receive medication initiation, titration, or adjustment in conjunction with psychiatry residents. Impact on Patient Care: Since October 2018, about 20 patients have been screened and provided with resources for mental health care if needed. Of those screened, 1 patient screened positive and was referred to a psychologist. Some screened were already well controlled on antidepressants or currently receiving mental health care. Conclusion: Mental health disorders are high among patients with HIV, with around 35% of patients and 49% of veterans having comorbid depression. The implementation of depression screening services is connecting those in need to mental health services to better optimize patient care and improve medication adherence. With this implementation, there are plans to further initiate other mental health services, such as anxiety and substance use screenings.Type: Innovative Practices.

We would like to thank our peer reviewers for their invested time and expertise as well as managing editors Jennifer Cross and Brian Smith and associate editors Bastian, Gandhi, Mallak, Murray, and Scala for their contributions to this issue. Recently awarded at the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) annual conference and named after EMJ¡¯s founder editor Ted Eschenbach, we would like to acknowledge that the 2018 ASEM Eschenbach Award for the Best EMJ Paper Award was given to Molly Floyd, Kash Barker, Claudio Rocco, and Mackenzie Whitman for their 2017 EMJ article ¡°A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Technique for Stochastic Task Criticality in Project Management.¡± Our issue begins with an article entitled ¡°Predicting Military Construction Project Time Outcomes Using Data Analytics¡± by Innocent, Wasek, and Franz. Their article provides a model to predict military construction project time outcome in the early phases of a project. Furthermore, this article presents an analysis of the factors that affect project time in the construction industry that engineering managers can use to understand other factors as they relate to their own domain/industry. The second article in this issue is ¡°Effects of ProjectRelated and Organizational-Related Factors on Five Dimensions of Project Performance: A Study Across the Construction Sectors in Malaysia¡± by Sekar, Viswanathan, and Sambasivan. This article contributes to the engineering management body of knowledge in three ways: (1) combining project-related and organizational-related factors in a single framework, (2) analyzing the impact of factors on five dimensions of project performance, and (3) analyzing the framework across different sectors of construction industry. Engineering managers can use their work to identify the project-related and organizational-related factors that have significant relationships with each dimension of project performance at different sectors in the construction industry and devise strategies to complete their projects as planned without compromising on the quality. ¡°Collaboration in Integrated Project Delivery: The Effects of Trust and Formal Contracts,¡± the third article authored by Zhang, Huang, and Peng, shows project collaboration is affected by the two basic governance mechanisms, formal contracts and trust including goodwill trust and competence trust. An engineering manager can use their work to increase their collaboration levels and maximize the project performance in Integrated Project Delivery projects by knowing the most suitable partners will have a high level of goodwill trust and moderate level of competence trust. In addition, managers can realize a well-specified contract is necessary to maximize collaboration and to seek an optimal mix of competence trust and formal contracts to facilitate collaborations. The fourth article in this issue, ¡°Project Governance, Project Performance and the Mediating Role of Project Quality and Project Management Risk: An Agency Theory Perspective,¡± was co-authored by Haq, Liang, Gu, Du, and Shuping. This article measures the influence of project governance on project performance directly and through the mediation of project management risk and project quality in IT and software development projects of Pakistan. This article provides engineering managers with insights on how effective project governance directly influences project performance and helps managers understand the role of leadership to enhance project performance. Our fifth and final article in this issue is ¡°Uncertainty Analysis and Resource Allocation in Construction Project Management¡± co-authored by Zhong, Chen, Zhou, and Hu. From a holistic perspective, this article assists engineering managers by providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between uncertainty, project parameters, and project performance. The premise of dealing with uncertainty in this article is to determine the impact of uncertainties on project performance. This article presents a framework for quantitative analysis that combines a fuzzy mathematics approach with system dynamics theory. Simulations generated using a model based on the framework show that uncertainties affect project performance by changing project parameters and that the mechanisms involved depend on the sources of the uncertainties. Furthermore, while technical and financial uncertainties mainly influence project costs, uncertainties related to markets, regulations, and organizational structures affect both project duration and cost. Finally, strategies for coping with uncertainties in a resource allocation perspective are presented.

We explore this question by leveraging a unique dataset of more than 310,000 detailed individual resumes for the 36 largest audit firms to identify audit firms¡¯ employment of AI workers. We provide a first look into the AI workforce within the auditing sector. AI workers tend to be male and relatively young and hold mostly but not exclusively technical degrees. Importantly, AI is a centralized function within the firm, with workers concentrating in a handful of teams and geographic locations. Our results show that investing in AI helps improve audit quality, reduces fees, and ultimately displaces human auditors, although the effect on labor takes several years to materialize. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation change in recent AI investments is associated with a 5.0% reduction in the likelihood of an audit restatement, a 0.9% drop in audit fees, and a reduction in the number of accounting employees that reaches 3.6% after three years and 7.1% after four years. Our empirical analyses are supported by in-depth interviews with 17 audit partners representing the eight largest U.S. public accounting firms, which show that (1) AI is developed centrally; (2) AI is widely used in audit; and (3) the primary goal for using AI in audit is improved quality, followed by efficiency.",Crossref,100,10.1007/s11142-022-09697-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-022-09697-x,2022,Review of Accounting Studies,ok,"CR-biblio:  Is artificial intelligence improving the audit process?

Six studies that deploy a mix of correlational and experimental methods support this hypothesis. Evidence indicates that individuals randomly assigned to collaborate in laboratory dyads converged on levels of overconfidence about their own performance rankings. In a controlled experimental context, observing overconfident peers causally increased an individual's degree of bias. The transmission effect persisted over time and across task domains, elevating overconfidence even days after initial exposure. In addition, overconfidence spread across indirect social ties (person to person to person), and transmission operated outside of reported awareness. However, individuals showed a selective in-group bias; overconfidence was acquired only when displayed by a member of one's in-group (and not out-group), consistent with theoretical notions of selective learning bias. Combined, these results advance understanding of the social factors that underlie interindividual differences in overconfidence and suggest that social transmission processes may be in part responsible for why local confidence norms emerge in groups, teams, and organizations.

Understanding these differences may illuminate important mechanisms driving the effectiveness of work-family policies. We theorize that one key driver of within-group variation in the effectiveness of work-family programs is the extent to which workers¡¯ nonwork social networks activate resources to support them. Specifically, we argue that workers whose nonwork networks are less likely to activate supportive resources will benefit more from organizational programs. We further posit that the status characteristics of workers¡¯ dependents may shape the activation of resources among nonwork networks.

We argue that quantification affects worker productivity via auto-gamification, or workers¡¯ inadvertent transformation of work into an independent, individual-level game. We further argue that quantification is likely to raise productivity in a context of simple work, where auto-gamification is motivating because quantified metrics adequately measure the work being performed. When work is complex, by contrast, quantification reduces productivity because quantified metrics cannot adequately measure the multifaceted work being performed, causing auto-gamification to be demotivating. To substantiate our argument, we study implementation of an RFID measurement technology that quantifies individual workers¡¯ output in real time at a garment factory in India.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ¡« 1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 ? 8 + 8 Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars.

If landholders self-select into PES programs based on how much conservation they were going to undertake anyway, then those who were planning to conserve should always enroll. This paper discusses the less-appreciated fact that enrollment is often based on other factors too. The hassle of signing up or financial costs of enrollment (e.g., purchasing seedlings) can affect who participates in a PES program. These enrollment costs reduce overall take-up, and, importantly, they can also influence the composition of landholders who select into the program¡ªand thereby the program¡¯s environmental benefits per enrollee. Enrollment costs can increase a program¡¯s benefits per enrollee if they are systematically higher for (and thus deter enrollment by) landholders who would have conserved anyway. Alternatively, enrollment costs can dampen per-enrollee benefits if their correlation with status-quo conservation is in the opposite direction. We illustrate these points with evidence from two studies of randomized trials of PES programs aimed at increasing forest cover in Uganda and Malawi. We also discuss how in other sectors, such as social welfare, policy designers have purposefully adjusted the costs of program enrollment to influence the composition of participants and improve cost-effectiveness.

In comparison to the mean composition of adjacent beds of identical composition, the conduits are enriched in Fe, Cr, Ti, and Mg. This suggests that fluid-escape was not only a consequence of overpressure buildup from decaying microbial mats in the shallow subsurface or of water-level fluctuations but also due to periodic or continuous release of hydrothermal fluids circulating in the thermal aureole above the cooling Lomati River Sill of Moodies age. Such an inference is also supported by textures characteristic of in-place argillaceous and sericitic alteration and by Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous matter (RSCM) indicating temperatures ca. 50 to 100¡ãC above the regional maximum metamorphic temperature of 320 to 380¡ãC.

HLE consists of 2,700 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.",Semantic Scholar,99,10.48550/arXiv.2501.14249,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a5524d085ac586d531021dcb1ec156eaf942b109,2025,Robotics,ok,"CR-biblio:Euiyoung Kim  Euiyoung Kim, Sara L","Euiyoung Kim, Miura Hiroki, Korea, Japan and China¡¯s Social Economy Mapping",10.24987/snuacar.2017.02.6.2.339,,Goal 9,0.005834572,FALSE,

Challenges like light absorption and scattering result in color distortion and decreased visibility. Traditional underwater image acquisition methods face these obstacles, highlighting the need for advanced techniques to solve the image color shift and image detail loss caused by the underwater environment in the image enhancement process. This study proposes a salient region-guided underwater image enhancement fusion method to alleviate these problems. First, this study proposes an advanced dark channel prior method to reduce haze effects in underwater images, significantly improving visibility and detail. Subsequently, a comprehensive RGB color correction restores the underwater scene¡¯s natural appearance. The innovation of our method is that it fuses through a combination of Laplacian and Gaussian pyramids, guided by salient region coefficients, thus preserving and accentuating the visually significant elements of the underwater environment.

In support of the drafting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we estimate what the grand convergence investment case might achieve¡ªand what investment would be required¡ªby 2030. Methods and Findings Our projection focuses on a sub-set of low-income (LIC) or lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). We start with a country-based (bottom-up) analysis of the costs and impact of scaling up reproductive, maternal, and child health tools, and select HIV and malaria interventions. We then incorporate global (top-down) analyses of the costs and impacts of scaling up existing tools for tuberculosis, additional HIV interventions, the costs to strengthen health systems, and the costs and benefits from scaling up new health interventions over the time horizon of this forecast. These data are then allocated to individual countries to provide an aggregate projection of potential cost and impact at the country level. Finally, incremental costs of R&D for low-income economies and the costs of addressing NTDs are added to provide a global total cost estimate of the investment scenario. Results Compared with a constant coverage scenario, there would be more than 60 million deaths averted in LIC and 70 million deaths averted in LMIC between 2016 and 2030. For the years 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030, the incremental costs of convergence in LIC would be (US billion) $24.3, $21.8, $24.7, and $27, respectively; in LMIC, the incremental costs would be (US billion) $34.75, $38.9, $48.7, and $56.3, respectively.

Prior research has offered two perspectives that have heretofore been conceptually disconnected: One focuses on personal values, while another emphasizes perceptions of the cultural code. We develop a theoretical account that integrates these approaches by linking them to distinct mechanisms and behavioral consequences of cultural fit. We propose that value congruence¡ªthe match between one's values and those that prevail in an organization¡ªrelates to the mechanism of group attachment and shapes behavior when one periodically steps back from day-to-day interactions, assesses one's identification with an organization, and determines whether to stay or voluntarily depart. In contrast, we argue that perceptual congruence¡ªthe degree to which one implicitly understands an organization¡¯s prevailing values and norms¡ªrelates to the mechanism of interpersonal coordination and influences behavior when one engages in routine peer interactions. Accordingly, we theorize that these two forms of cultural fit relate to distinct behaviors, voluntary exit and linguistic conformity with peers, respectively. Drawing on email and survey data from a mid-sized technology firm, we find support for our theory and discuss implications of our findings for research on person-culture fit, dual-process models of culture and cognition, and the pairing of surveys with digital trace data.",Crossref,90.90909091,10.31235/osf.io/9j5qf,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9j5qf,2023,,ok,CR-biblio:Lu 2023 Two-Sided cultural fit: The differing behavioral consequences of cultural congruence based on values versus perc,Two-Sided Cultural Fit: The Differing Behavioral Consequences of Cultural Congruence Based on Values Versus Perceptions,10.31235/osf.io/9j5qf,,Goal 17,0.018686224,FALSE,

To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles).

To reduce perceived uncertainty in judgments of the quality of experts, clients may rely on ascriptive characteristics of experts and on pairwise, relational factors to assess the advice they receive. Two such characteristics, expert gender and client-expert gender concordance, may lead to differences in clients¡¯ trust in expert advice. To explore these issues, we investigate the incidence of patient-initiated second opinions (SOs) in medicine. In an examination of millions of medical claims in Massachusetts, we find that male patients are much more likely than female patients to obtain an SO if the first specialist they consult is female. Moreover, when the first specialist a patient consults is gender non-concordant and the patient seeks an SO, male patients are substantially more likely to switch to a same-gender specialist in the SO visit. Because patients who lack confidence in the advice of the first-seen specialist infrequently return to this specialist for medical services, female specialists generate lower billings. Analyses of medical spending in follow-up visits suggest that gendered patterns in questioning the advice of medical experts have the potential to contribute substantially to the gender pay gap in medicine.",Semantic Scholar,100,10.1177/00031224221087374,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8416b6590c8e174c45dbff972c942bbfc4f8124e,2022,American Sociological Review,ok,CR-biblio:Mathijs de Vaan and Toby Stuart.

In India, Quetiapine is one of the approved drugs for use in depressive episodes for bipolar disorder. Objectives This post-hoc analysis of an Indian Phase 3 study was conducted to evaluate the correlation of severity of depression assessed via Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and quality of life assessed via Quality-of-life enjoyment and satisfaction-short form questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-SF) when treated with Lumateperone 42mg or Quetiapine 300mg. Methods The phase-III, randomized, multi-centric, assessor-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, comparative, non-inferiority study included patients with Bipolar II depression with moderate severity having a MADRS score ¡Ý20 and Clinical global impression¨Cbipolar version¨Cseverity (CGI-BP-S) score ¡Ý4. The study was conducted after receiving regulatory and ethics committee approvals. The patients were randomized (1:1) to either receive Lumateperone 42mg [Test] or Quetiapine 300mg [Comparator] for 6 weeks. In this post-hoc analysis, correlation between MADRS and Q-LES-Q-SF were evaluated and for safety outcomes treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed. [Clinical trial registration: CTRI/2023/10/058583] Results This post-hoc analysis included 462 patients [231 each in Test and Comparator]. The baseline demographic characteristics were comparable in between treatment arms. The Pearson¡¯s correlation coefficient between change from baseline in MADRS score and Q-LES-Q-SF score was statistically significant for both treatment arms at Day 42 [Test: -0.192, p=0.0043; Comparator: -0.299, p<0.0001] and the linear regression between 2 arms was not statistically significant (p=0.0853), indicating weak negative correlation between the 2 scales [Figure 1 and Figure 2]. The incidence of TEAEs were similar in both treatment arms [Test: 34.6%; Comparator: 35.5%] and no serious adverse events were reported. Image 1: Image 2: Conclusions This post-hoc analysis demonstrated that patient with Bipolar II depression when treated with Lumateperone 42mg or Quetiapine 300mg, the reduction in MADRS score is inversely proportional to Q-LES-Q-SF score.

This literature finds that using a larger-than-usual truncation parameter to estimate the long-run variance, combined with Kiefer-Vogelsang (2002, 2005) fixed-b critical values, can substantially reduce size distortions, at only a modest cost in (size-adjusted) power. Empirical practice, however, has not kept up. This article therefore draws on the post-Newey West/Andrews literature to make concrete recommendations for HAR inference. We derive truncation parameter rules that choose a point on the size-power tradeoff to minimize a loss function. If Newey-West tests are used, we recommend the truncation parameter rule S = 1.3T 1/2 and (nonstandard) fixed-b critical values.

Much of the angst around networking can be traced to concerns about authenticity, including the need to be authentic, to be seen as authentic, to find authentic partners, and to build authentic relationships. In this paper, we review the literature on networking and authenticity to consider how different individuals might experience authenticity challenges in different forms of networking. We then describe three strategies for overcoming concerns about authenticity¡ªignore it, embrace it, and transcend it¡ªand discuss the key merits and limitations of each approach. We advocate for transcending authenticity through cognitive reappraisals, which entails shifting the focus from the self to others by adopting a growth mindset.

Further, we find that these effects are not driven only by positivity, but positive selves (Study 4), and mediated by the identity centrality (Study 5). Finally, Study 6 finds that this positivity bias does not extend to other-rated authenticity: people who present an overly positive self seem less authentic to others relative to a mixed or negative self-presentation.

In particular, we find higher demand for R&W insurance and a higher R&W insurance premium charged when the target belongs to an industry with weaker internal controls. We also find that a higher premium is charged when the target is in an industry with relatively high levels of R&D to sales, indicating that the insurance company expects unrecognized intangible assets to have a greater risk of future claims.

We find that parties account for approximately 40% of the political polarization in legislative voting over this time period, a critical inflection point in U.S. polarization.

We first showcase the importance of analyzing autocratic regimes as non©\unitary actors by discussing extant work on non©\democracies in sub©\Saharan Africa and China, where the prevailing view of winner©\take©\all contests can be clearly rejected. We show how specific biographical information about powerful cadres helps shed light upon the composition of the inner circles that empower autocrats. We further provide an application of these methods to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), one of the most personalistic, opaque and data©\poor political regimes in the world today. Employing information from DPRK state media on participants at official state events, we are able to trace the evolution and consolidation of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un around the transition period following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. The internal factional divisions of the DPRK are explored during and after this transition.

Compared with observed heterogeneity within EU member states themselves, or in well-functioning federations such as the United States, cultural diversity across EU members is of a similar order of magnitude.

How might product teams be empowered to tackle hateful speech and promote inclusive language proactively among users? We developed an intervention that targets the organizational culture of tech companies and their product teams as a driver for change. More specifically, the intervention aimed to advance inclusive language practices within product teams, while introducing product development frameworks for advancing inclusive language and mitigating hateful language among social media product users. For this study, we partnered with a large U.S.-headquartered tech firm that owns several social media products to develop and pilot the intervention. The intervention was implemented with 238 participants¡ªrepresenting employees of the firm across several global locations, with particular representation from the United States¡ªin seven workshops. Forty participants were tracked semilongitudinally across three surveys¡ªprior to the intervention, immediately after, and 4 months after. Two participants participated in in-depth interviews 6 months after the intervention. Survey data were submitted to ordinal regression models that examined difference in workshop attendees¡¯ confidence levels across the three time periods. Findings reveal positive impacts over time among product teams in regard to enhanced agency in advancing inclusive language and mitigating hateful speech among users. More specifically, confidence levels to guide one¡¯s team in preventing or mitigating harmful language among product users significantly increased by 13.6% (p?<?.0001) from before the intervention to both postworkshop surveys. Confidence levels to guide one¡¯s team in enhancing inclusive language among users significantly increased by 18.1% (p?<?.0001) pre- to postworkshop.

We propose utilizing the concept of linguistic justice¡ªthe realization of equitable access to social and political life regardless of language¡ªto provide a framework for examining natural language processing tools that learn from and use human language data. To support linguistic justice, we argue that natural language processing tools (along with the datasets that are used to train and evaluate them) must be examined not only from the perspective of a privileged, majority language user, but also from the perspectives of minoritized language users. Considering such perspectives can help to surface areas in which the data used within natural language processing tools may be (often inadvertently) working against linguistic justice by failing to provide access to information, services, or opportunities in users¡¯ language of choice, underperforming for certain linguistic groups, or advancing harmful stereotypes that can lead to negative life outcomes for members of marginalized groups.

Operations Research, Volume 72, Issue 2 . 2024",2024,"Kostas Bimpikis, Ilan Morgenstern , and Daniela Saban","We explore the welfare implications of data tracking technologies that enable firms to collect consumer data and potentially use it for price discrimination. The model we develop centers around two features: first, competition between firms and, second, consumers' level of sophistication. Our baseline environment features a firm that can collect information about the consumers it transacts with in a duopoly market, which it can then use in a second monopoly market. We characterize and compare the equilibrium outcomes in three settings of interest: (i) an economy with myopic consumers, who, when making purchase decisions, do not internalize the fact that firms have the ability to track their behavior and use this information in future transactions, (ii) an economy with forward-looking consumers, who take into account the implications of data tracking when determining their actions, and (iii) an economy where no data tracking technologies are used either due to technological or regulatory constraints. We find that the absence of data tracking may lead to a decrease in consumer surplus, even when consumers are myopic. Importantly, this result relies critically on competition: consumer surplus may be higher when data tracking technologies are used in the marketplace only when multiple firms offer substitutable products to consumers. Our results contribute to the debate of whether to regulate firms' use of data tracking technologies by illustrating that their effect on consumers depends not only on their level of sophistication, i.e., the extent to which they internalize how their data may be used, but also on the degree of competition in the market. Finally, in contrast to earlier work, we show that firms may have no incentive to self-regulate their use of consumer data even when consumers fully internalize and anticipate how their data may be used.

Management Science, Volume 69, Issue 10 . 2023",2023,"Yonatan Gur, Gregory Macnamara, Ilan Morgenstern , and Daniela Saban","We consider a platform facilitating trade between sellers and buyers with the objective of maximizing consumer surplus. Even though in many such marketplaces, prices are set by revenue-maximizing sellers, platforms can influence prices through (i) price-dependent promotion policies that can increase demand for a product by featuring it in a prominent position on the web page and (ii) the information revealed to sellers about the value of being promoted. Identifying effective joint information design and promotion policies is a challenging dynamic problem as sellers can sequentially learn the promotion value from sales observations and update prices accordingly. We introduce the notion of confounding promotion policies, which are designed to prevent a Bayesian seller from learning the promotion value (at the expense of the short-run loss of diverting some consumers from the best product offering). Leveraging these policies, we characterize the maximum long-run average consumer surplus that is achievable through joint information design and promotion policies when the seller sets prices myopically. We then construct a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, in which the seller¡¯s best response to the platform¡¯s optimal policy is to price myopically in every period. Moreover, the equilibrium we identify is platform optimal within the class of horizon-maximin equilibria, in which strategies are not predicated on precise knowledge of the horizon length and are designed to maximize payoff over the worst-case horizon. Our analysis allows one to identify practical long-run average optimal platform policies in a broad range of demand models.

(with Lucas Davis) Energy Policy and the Economy , Ed","In many countries, the revenue from gasoline taxes is used to fund highways and other transportation infrastructure. As the number of electric vehicles on the road increases, this raises questions about the effectiveness and equity of this financing mechanism. In this paper, we ask whether electric vehicle drivers should pay a mileage tax. Though the gasoline tax has been traditionally viewed as a benefits tax, we instead take the perspective of economic efficiency. We derive a condition for the optimal electric vehicle mileage tax that highlights a key trade-off. On the one hand, there are externalities from driving, including traffic congestion and accidents, that imply a mileage tax is efficient. On the other hand, gasoline tends to be underpriced, so a low (or even negative) mileage tax might have efficiency benefits in encouraging substitution away from gasoline-powered vehicles. We then turn to an empirical analysis aimed at better understanding the current policy landscape for electric vehicles in the United States. Using newly available, nationally representative microdata, we calculate that electric vehicles have reduced gasoline tax revenues by $250 million annually. We show that the forgone tax revenue is highly concentrated in a handful of states and is highly regressive, as most electric vehicles are driven by high-income households, and we discuss how this motivates and informs optimal policy.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100,10.1086/706793,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85d6f08fa8b1fe54b57314a881da8b2899b57bf9,2019,Environmental and Energy Policy and the Economy,ok,"CR-biblio: 2020 Should Electric Vehicle Drivers Pay a Mileage Tax?

The Quarterly Journal of Economics . 2020,2020,Jonathan L Weigel,"Delegating tax collection to informal leaders could raise tax revenue but runs the risk of undermining the local accountability of those leaders. We investigate this trade-off by exploiting whether city chiefs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were randomly assigned to collect property taxes in 2018. To measure accountability, we study the other side of the social contract: the distribution of resources by chiefs in a government cash transfer programme in which they had discretion over the recipients of development aid. In line with the preferences of citizens, chiefs who collected taxes allocated more programme benefits to poorer households and thus made fewer inclusion and exclusion errors. They were no more or less likely to pocket benefits themselves or allocate them to their families. Across a range of measures, citizens appear to have updated their beliefs of chiefs who collected taxes. We provide evidence that collector chiefs allocated aid to poorer households because door-to-door tax collection created opportunities to learn which households were in greatest need.

To accomplish this goal, we devised a strategy to identify compounds that act synergistically with remdesivir in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conducted combinatorial high-throughput screening in the presence of submaximal remdesivir concentrations, using a human lung epithelial cell line infected with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2.

Lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) display a broad histological spectrum from low-grade lepidic tumors through to mid-grade acinar and papillary and high-grade solid, cribriform and micropapillary tumors. How morphology reflects tumor evolution and disease progression is poorly understood. Whole-exome sequencing data generated from 805 primary tumor regions and 121 paired metastatic samples across 248 LUADs from the TRACERx 421 cohort, together with RNA-sequencing data from 463 primary tumor regions, were integrated with detailed whole-tumor and regional histopathological analysis. Tumors with predominantly high-grade patterns showed increased chromosomal complexity, with higher burden of loss of heterozygosity and subclonal somatic copy number alterations. Individual regions in predominantly high-grade pattern tumors exhibited higher proliferation and lower clonal diversity, potentially reflecting large recent subclonal expansions. Co-occurrence of truncal loss of chromosomes 3p and 3q was enriched in predominantly low-/mid-grade tumors, while purely undifferentiated solid-pattern tumors had a higher frequency of truncal arm or focal 3q gains and SMARCA4 gene alterations compared with mixed-pattern tumors with a solid component, suggesting distinct evolutionary trajectories. Clonal evolution analysis revealed that tumors tend to evolve toward higher-grade patterns. The presence of micropapillary pattern and ¡®tumor spread through air spaces¡¯ were associated with intrathoracic recurrence, in contrast to the presence of solid/cribriform patterns, necrosis and preoperative circulating tumor DNA detection, which were associated with extra-thoracic recurrence.

Linear mixed models were constructed to examine the relationship between biomarker concentrations and recent food intake, symptoms of illness, concurrent enteropathogen infection, and socioeconomic status. Average concentrations of MPO, NEO, and AAT were considerably higher than published references for healthy adults. The concentration of each biomarker tended to decrease over the first 2 years of life and was highly variable between samples from each individual child. Both MPO and AAT were significantly elevated by recent breast milk intake. All three biomarkers were associated with pathogen presence, although the strength and direction varied by pathogen. The interpretation of biomarker concentrations is subject to the context of their collection.

Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively.

Manufacturing & Service Operations Management . 2021",2021,Invite Your Friend and You¡¯ll Move Up in Line: Optimal Design of Referral Priority Programs,"Problem definition : This paper studies the optimal design of referral priority programs, in which customers on a waiting list can jump the line by inviting their friends to also join the waiting list. Academic/practical relevance : Recent years have witnessed a growing presence of referral priority programs as a novel customer-acquisition strategy for firms that maintain a waiting list. Different variations of this scheme are seen in practice, raising the question of what should be the optimal referral priority mechanism. Methodology : I build an analytical model that integrates queuing theory into a mechanism design framework in which the objective of the firm is to maximize the system throughput, that is, accelerate customer acquisition as much as possible. Results : My analysis shows that the optimal mechanism has one of the following structures: full priority; partial priority; first in, first out (FIFO); and strategic delay. A full-priority (partial-priority) scheme enables referring customers to get ahead of all (only some) nonreferring ones. A FIFO scheme does not provide any priority-based referral incentive. A strategic-delay scheme grants full priority to referring customers but artificially inflates the delay of nonreferring ones. I show that FIFO is optimal if either the base-market size or the referral cost is large. Otherwise, partial priority is optimal if the base-market size is above a certain threshold; full priority is optimal at the threshold base-market size; strategic delay is optimal if the base-market size is below the threshold. I also find that referrals motivate the firm to maintain a larger capacity and therefore can surprisingly shorten the average delay, even though more customers sign up and strategic delay is sometimes inserted. Managerial implications : My paper provides prescriptive guidance for launching an optimal referral priority program and rationalizes common referral schemes seen in practice.",Crossref,100,10.1287/msom.2020.0868,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2020.0868,2021,Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management,ok,"CR-biblio:Yang, L..

While the US has succeeded in alternatively growing VC, there is an increasing concern that the latter has occurred partially because valuations are stretched, tax concessions for carried-interest capital gains are too high and corporate control benefits are becoming increasingly diluted.

We analyze a second best problem where the government can tax automation but lacks redistributive tools to fully alleviate borrowing frictions. The equilibrium is (constrained) inefficient and automation is excessive. Firms do not internalize that automation depresses the income of automated workers early on during the transition, precisely when they become borrowing constrained. The government finds it optimal to slow down automation on efficiency grounds, even when it does not value equity.

Journal of International Economics . 2019",2019,"Matilde Bombardini, Gianluca Orefice and Maria Tito","Does opening a market to international trade affect the pattern of matching between firms and workers? This paper answers this question both theoretically and empirically in three parts. We set up a model of matching between heterogeneous workers and firms in which variation in the worker type at the firm level exists in equilibrium only because of the presence of search costs. When firms gain access to the foreign market, their revenue potential increases. When stakes are high, matching with the right worker becomes particularly important because deviations from the ideal match quickly reduce the value of the relationship. Hence, exporting firms select sets of workers that are less dispersed relative to the average. We then document a novel fact about the hiring decisions of exporting firms versus non-exporting firms in a French matched employer-employee dataset. We construct the type of each worker using both a traditional wage regression and a model-based approach and construct measures of the average worker type and worker type dispersion at the firm level. We find that exporting firms feature a lower type dispersion in the pool of workers they hire. This effect is comparable and larger than the common finding in the literature that exporters pay higher wages because, among other factors, they employ better workers. The matching between exporting firms and workers is even tighter in sectors characterized by better exporting opportunities as measured by foreign demand or tariff shocks. Finally, we show that revenue loss is lower relative to the optimum allocation for exporting and more productive firms. This analysis is suggestive of the potenti al presence of additional gains from trade due to improved sorting.",Semantic Scholar,91.99607,10.17016/FEDS.2015.113,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1dd916ba9a91c6cdd8b478998fa850e5a769b666,2015,Journal of International Economics,ok,"CR-biblio:Matilde Bombardini, Gianluca Orefice and Maria Tito.

In the solar physics literature, the MM is sometimes associated with a period of cooler global temperatures, referred to as the Little Ice Age (LIA), and thus taken as compelling evidence of a large, direct solar influence on climate. In this study, we bring together existing simulation and observational studies, particularly the most recent solar activity and paleoclimate reconstructions, to examine this relation. Using northern hemisphere surface air temperature reconstructions, the LIA can be most readily defined as an approximately 480?year period spanning AD 1440¨C1920, although not all of this period was notably cold. While the MM occurred within the much longer LIA period, the timing of the features are not suggestive of causation and should not, in isolation, be used as evidence of significant solar forcing of climate. Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use.",Semantic Scholar,99.98961999,10.1051/SWSC/2017034,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a5e4bcd7833cf588ba0c23bbf1453fefc4b36ad,2017,,ok,"CR-biblio:Matthew Backus, Andrew Little.

The central idea of the research study is to explore three main questions: 1. How can businesses effectively implement AI technologies to improve customer engagement ethically? 2. What are the ethical dilemmas and potential risks associated with AI-driven customer engagement? 3. How can transparency and authenticity be maintained in AI-driven interactions to foster trust? The study emphasizes the urgent need for businesses to transition from an algorithm-centric model to one that prioritizes authenticity. This research analyzed ethical concerns for maintaining consumer trust and loyalty. The result of the study aims to provide actionable insights to help businesses navigate the ethical challenges posed by AI to reinforce the commitment to ethical standards while enhancing consumer satisfaction. The study&#39;s findings advocate for transparency, accountability, and proactive measures mitigating the risks associated with AI deployment.

Wild-type hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 display an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a ¡®steric zipper¡¯ motif in the PrLD, which accelerates formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Importantly, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant ¡®steric zipper¡¯ motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs must be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.",Semantic Scholar,17.77777778,10.1038/nature11922,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/018829fb5f02f5688b46cea6427aaeeeeb2210f4,2013,Nature,ok,"CR-biblio:  Moore, Jack B",,10.1038/nature11922,,Goal 3,0.012890279,FALSE,

Journal of Experimental Psychology: General . 2018",2018,"Moore, Jennifer M","Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the latest generation of smart cell phones now incorporates many diverse and powerful sensors. These sensors include GPS sensors, vision sensors (i.e., cameras), audio sensors (i.e., microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (i.e., magnetic compasses), and acceleration sensors (i.e., accelerometers). The availability of these sensors in mass-marketed communication devices creates exciting new opportunities for data mining and data mining applications. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based accelerometers to perform activity recognition, a task which involves identifying the physical activity a user is performing. To implement our system we collected labeled accelerometer data from twenty-nine users as they performed daily activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing, and then aggregated this time series data into examples that summarize the user activity over 10- second intervals. We then used the resulting training data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. This work is significant because the activity recognition model permits us to gain useful knowledge about the habits of millions of users passively---just by having them carry cell phones in their pockets. Our work has a wide range of applications, including automatic customization of the mobile device's behavior based upon a user's activity (e.g., sending calls directly to voicemail if a user is jogging) and generating a daily/weekly activity profile to determine if a user (perhaps an obese child) is performing a healthy amount of exercise.",Semantic Scholar,99.1889098,10.1145/1964897.1964918,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fdbbbbb2e9a78e70de0e553792c3554942b7ee59,2011,SKDD,ok,"CR-biblio:Don A.

We discuss Jaguar's scientific features that are relevant to chemical research as well as describe those aspects of the program that are pertinent to the user interface, the organization of the computer code, and its maintenance and testing. Among the scientific topics that feature prominently in this paper are the quantum chemical methods grounded in the pseudospectral approach. A number of multistep workflows dependent on Jaguar are covered: prediction of protonation equilibria in aqueous solutions (particularly calculations of tautomeric stability and pKa), reactivity predictions based on automated transition state search, assembly of Boltzmann-averaged spectra such as vibrational and electronic circular dichroism, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance. Discussed also are quantum chemical calculations that are oriented toward materials science applications, in particular, prediction of properties of optoelectronic materials and organic semiconductors, and molecular catalyst design. The topic of treatment of conformations inevitably comes up in real world research projects and is considered as part of all the workflows mentioned above. In addition, we examine the role of machine learning methods in quantum chemical calculations performed by Jaguar, from auxiliary functions that return the approximate calculation runtime in a user interface, to prediction of actual molecular properties. The current work is second in a series of reviews of Jaguar, the first having been published more than ten years ago.

August 2019",2019,Enrico Moretti,"We investigate how and why the productivity of a worker varies as a function of the productivity of her co-workers in a group production process. In theory, the introduction of a high productivity worker could lower the effort of incumbent workers because of free riding; or it could increase the effort of incumbent workers because of peer effects induced by social norms, social pressure, or learning. Using scanner level data, we measure high frequency, worker-level productivity of checkers for a large grocery chain. Because of the firm's scheduling policy, the timing of within-day changes in personnel is unsystematic, a feature for which we find consistent support in the data. We find strong evidence of positive productivity spillovers from the introduction of highly productive personnel into a shift. A 10% increase in average co-worker permanent productivity is associated with 1.7% increase in a worker's effort. Most of this peer effect arises from low productivity workers benefiting from the presence of high productivity workers. Therefore, the optimal mix of workers in a given shift is the one that maximizes skill diversity. In order to explain the mechanism that generates the peer effect, we examine whether effort depends on workers' ability to monitor one another due to their spatial arrangement, and whether effort is affected by the time workers have previously spent working together. We find that a given worker's effort is positively related to the presence and speed of workers who face him, but not the presence and speed of workers whom he faces (and do not face him). In addition, workers respond more to the presence of co-workers with whom they frequently overlap. These patterns indicate that these individuals are motivated by social pressure and mutual monitoring, and suggest that social preferences can play an important role in inducing effort, even when economic incentives are limited.",Semantic Scholar,97.0970971,10.1257/AER.99.1.112,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3f33d9810eabfb9a375b4814a250fef03e0bdd9,2006,Social Science Research Network,ok,"CR-biblio:Enrico Moretti.

Two societies with similar economic and biological fundamentals may have vastly different degrees of intergenerational mobility depending on their political institutions.

Central to our analysis are the concepts of appropriability ¡ªwhether firms in the industry are able to control the knowledge generated by their innovations¡ªand complementary assets ¡ªwhether effective entry requires access to specialized infrastructure and capabilities to which incumbent firms can ration access. While the rapid improvements in AI foundation models promise transformative impacts across broad sectors of the economy, we argue that tight control over complementary assets will likely result in a concentrated market structure, as in past episodes of technological upheaval. We suggest the likely paths through which incumbent firms may restrict entry, confining newcomers to subordinate roles and stifling broad sectoral innovation. We conclude with speculations regarding how this oligopolistic future might be averted. Policy interventions aimed at fractionalizing or facilitating shared access to complementary assets might help preserve competition and incentives for extending the generative AI frontier. Ironically, the best hopes for a vibrant open source AI ecosystem might rest on the presence of a ¡°rogue¡± technology giant, who might choose openness and engagement with smaller firms as a strategic weapon wielded against other incumbents.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100,10.3386/w32474,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/112480ed6b6647263b7d49332bd953ed9b2f68f9,2024,Social Science Research Network,ok,"CR-biblio: 2024 Old Moats for New Models: Openness, Control, and Competition in Generative AI (with Pierre Azoulay, Joshua Krieger","Old Moats for New Models: Openness, Control, and Competition in Generative AI",10.3386/w32474,,Goal 9,0.044352986,FALSE,innovation ecosystems; policy environment for innovation

This study evaluates information seeding, an early-stage intervention to bootstrap online communities that enables contributors to build on externally sourced information rather than have them start from scratch. I analyze the effects of information seeding on follow-on contributions using data on more than 350 million contributions made by more than 577,000 contributors to OpenStreetMap, a crowd-sourced map-making community seeded with data from the U.S. Census. I estimate the effect of seeding using a natural experiment in which an oversight caused about 60% of U.S. counties to be seeded with a complete census map, while the rest were seeded with less complete versions. Although access to basic knowledge generally encourages downstream knowledge production, I find that a higher level of information seeding significantly lowered follow-on contributions and contributor activity on OpenStreetMap, and was associated with lower levels of long-term quality. However, seeding did benefit densely populated urban areas and did not discourage more committed users. To explain these patterns, I argue that information seeding can crowd out contributors¡¯ ability to develop ownership over baseline knowledge and thereby disincentivize follow-on contributions.

Journal of Experimental Psychology: General , 149(6), 1193.",2020,Overestimating the valuations and preferences of others,"People often make judgments about their own and others' valuations and preferences. Across 12 studies (N = 17,594), we find a robust bias in these judgments such that people overestimate the valuations and preferences of others. This overestimation arises because, when making predictions about others, people rely on their intuitive core representation of the experience (e.g., is the experience generally positive?) in lieu of a more complex representation that might also include countervailing aspects (e.g., is any of the experience negative?). We first demonstrate that the overestimation bias is pervasive for a wide range of positive (Studies 1-5) and negative experiences (Study 6). Furthermore, the bias is not merely an artifact of how preferences are measured (Study 7). Consistent with judgments based on core representations, the bias significantly reduces when the core representation is uniformly positive (Studies 8A-8B). Such judgments lead to a paradox in how people see others trade off between valuation and utility (Studies 9A-9B). Specifically, relative to themselves, people believe that an identically paying other will get more enjoyment from the same experience, but paradoxically, that an identically enjoying other will pay more for the same experience. Finally, consistent with a core representation explanation, explicitly prompting people to consider the entire distribution of others' preferences significantly reduced or eliminated the bias (Study 10). These findings suggest that social judgments of others' preferences are not only largely biased, but they also ignore how others make trade-offs between evaluative metrics.

People pay less for uncertain prospects than their worst possible outcomes, and researchers have proposed that this effect occurs because people strongly dislike risk. We challenge this proposition across seven studies. Though people seem to irrationally dislike risky prospects when preference is assessed with open-ended pricing measures, such as willingness-to-pay, people display rational responses toward risky prospects when preference is assessed using rating measures, such as ratings of expected enjoyment. This discrepancy does not seem to arise because these measures (a) focus on different components of the uncertainty, (b) rely on context-dependent versus normed scales, or (c) involve voluntarily opting into an uncertain situation. Accordingly, we find that people also display rational responses toward risky prospects with time measures (i.e., willingness-to-wait and anticipated time usage) and choice.

Advocates of internal meta-analysis argue that it provides an efficient approach to increasing statistical power and solving the file-drawer problem.

For example, the kind of minimal p-hacking that increases the false-positive rate of 1 study to just 8% increases the false-positive rate of a 10-study internal meta-analysis to 83%. If selective reporting is approximately zero, but not exactly zero, then internal meta-analysis is invalid.

A scientometric analysis is effective and widely used to summarize the most influential studies within a certain field. We present the first scientometric analysis of palliative care for patients with glioma. Methods Based on a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) principle, we conducted a generalized search for articles on palliative care for glioma in the Web of Science database and evaluated the top 100 most frequently cited articles among 2,542 articles. Results The number of citations for the top 100 cited articles on palliative care for glioma ranged from 10 to 223. We have a narrative conclusion, as follows: most of these articles were published in oncology-specific journals (n = 53) and palliative-specific journals (n = 22). The United States, Australia, and the Netherlands were the top three countries contributing most of the articles (n = 59). Most of the research methods were quantitative analyses, qualitative analyses, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses (n = 70). In quantitative studies, 66 scales were used, and the top three scales used included the following: the Distress Thermometer, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain Index (FACT-Br), and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). The articles were classified into six major categories based on research subjects, including patients (n = 44), caregivers (n = 16), patients and caregivers (n = 20), literature (n = 19), and healthcare providers (n = 1). Articles were classified into seven major categories based on research themes: quality of life (n = 11); end-of-life symptoms and care (n = 16); palliative and supportive care needs (n = 35); advance care planning and decision making (n = 4); psychological, social, and spiritual needs (n = 12); hospice utilization and referral (n = 3); and others (n = 19). The studies of the primary topic are correlated with the number of citations. Conclusions The results of the analysis indicated that patients diagnosed with glioma present a high variety of palliative care needs, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs. The caregiver¡¯s burden and needs are important as well. The proportion of quantitative analyses, qualitative analyses, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses is relatively high, but the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was low. End-of-life care and supportive care needs appeared frequently. Thus, palliative care is an urgent need to be addressed in glioma management.

We predict that the AT coefficient will be positive even in the absence of conditional conservatism, and it will vary with non-accounting factors even if the degree of conditional conservatism is held constant. Our empirical analysis shows that AT coefficient estimates vary in directions predicted by our theory. Specifically, we find that AT coefficient estimates increase with expected returns and asymmetry in the distribution of returns, and decrease with cash flow persistence. Importantly, we identify the spread between the variances of bad news and good news accruals as an alternative measure of conditional conservatism that is free of the effects confounding the AT coefficient. Consistent with a key implication of conditional conservatism, we find that the variance of bad news accruals is significantly higher than the variance of good news accruals primarily due to conditionally conservative accruals related to inventory write-downs, long-term asset write-downs, and goodwill impairments. A series of placebo tests provides additional support for the construct validity of our alternative measure of conditional conservatism.

First, annual estimates of NIPA corporate profits are designed to provide neutral estimates of income from current production regardless of whether times are good or bad. Second, we find spurious evidence of asymmetric sensitivity to aggregate return news in placebo test variables that are void of conditional conservatism, clearly indicating that an alternative explanation is in order.

Although this return variance effect is unlikely to be attributed to accounting, it has the potential to generate spurious evidence of conditional conservatism at the macro level. Overall, our study highlights the importance of construct validity tests in archival studies and contributes to research in the properties of NIPA corporate profits.

The 19th Congress of the Austrian Sport Science Society (¡°?sterreichische Sportwissenschaftliche Gesellschaft, ?SG¡±), held in Innsbruck, Austria, centered on the theme of¡± Embracing Interdisciplinarity in Sport Science.¡± The idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science has been discussed for over three decades and stems from its position as a cross-sectional discipline integrating various natural and social sciences such as training science, sports medicine, biomechanics, sport pedagogy, sport psychology, sport sociology, and sport history. More recently, sports economy and sports management have also emerged as significant areas within sport science. Sports science is characterized by its strong practical relevance. It often focuses on applied research, where interdisciplinarity plays a critical role.
Interdisciplinary work is a particularly important factor when approaching sport science from a problem-based perspective (G¨¹llich & Kr¨¹ger, 2022). Specifically, we argue that interdisciplinarity becomes crucial when we are trying to develop solutions for complex challenges in sport, the health sector, and society in general. For example, an interdisciplinary approach in sport science might merge aspects of psychology, physiology, and sociology with expertise of medical professionals to study and realize health promotion strategies. For the purpose of this editorial, we understand interdisciplinarity as a collaboration between individuals from different scientific disciplines but also from different professions with the goal of combining knowledge and methods to create new solutions for complex societal problems. This can range from the simple communication of ideas and experiences to mutual integration of concepts, methodologies, procedures, or data sharing (Zai? et al., 2021). We think that sport scientists can and should take a leading role in such collaborations given their unique cross-disciplinary education related to human health, performance, and well-being. Leadership in interdisciplinary collaborations may be an opportunity for us as sport scientists to strengthen our profile and image in the society and to take responsibility in addressing societal challenges (Hottenrott et al., 2017).
In preparation of this year¡¯s ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace this idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science. Before the event, we conducted an online survey across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) to identify current societal challenges that sport science should address and help with developing solutions. In parallel, we assessed the perceived importance of interdisciplinary work among sport scientists and related professions. Potential respondents to the survey were mainly contacted through the communication channels of the ?SG and its equivalent associations in Germany (dvs) and Switzerland (SGS). Consequently, respondents included sport scientists as well as professionals from other fields who follow or are part of the activities of sport science associations. The findings of the survey were used in three different ways and will be described in this editorial:

to summarize the most frequently mentioned challenges and topics that sport science should address and help with developing solutions,
to develop an ¡°Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop¡± for the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 where delegates transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved, and
to compare the survey results with the content of the scientific abstracts submitted to the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 and determine the alignment between the identified challenges and current research topics within the ?SG community.

The survey ¨C Current challenges for sport science and beyond
The survey responses were analyzed in MAXQDA 24 (VERBI software, 2021). The MAXQDA AI-Assist tool was used to suggest an initial coding scheme to group responses into categories. Two researchers refined the scheme into a final code set, independently coded the participants¡¯ responses, and discussed mismatches to agree on the final code assignments. The survey yielded 176 responses, of which 85 were fully completed. Respondents (42% women) had a mean age of 40.2 years (¡À 13.8). Regarding their primary professional field, 34% identified as scientists working at a university, college, or research institution, 26% were healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians or therapists), 15% worked in the private sector including self-employment, 13% were students or educators, and 12% were either coaches, athletes, or employed within a sports federation. 91% reported that interdisciplinarity was a key component of their work.
The most frequently mentioned challenges fell into the category of ¡°prevention and rehabilitation¡± (34%), followed by ¡°job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy¡± (23%), ¡°sport science mission for research and education¡± (11%), ¡°broader societal issues¡± (5%), ¡°structural development of organized and non-organized sports¡± (5%), ¡°inclusion and integration through sports¡± (4%), ¡°self-awareness and self-reflection¡± (3%), ¡°technological progress¡± (2%), ¡°financing¡± (2%), and ¡°elite sports¡± (2%; orange bars in Figure 1). Coding was not possible for 5% of the answers.
The workshop ¨C Transforming challenges into specific problems
Building on the findings of the survey, we collaborated with the ikivox collective (Nyon, France, https://ikivox.org/en/) to develop an ¡°Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop¡± held at the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. With the help of ikivox who specialize in collective intelligence and collaborative design approaches, we designed a workshop with the following objectives:

to transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved with innovative solutions
to experience interdisciplinary collaboration and new ways of working together
to position the Austrian Sport Science Society (?SG) as an enabler, bringing value to its members to improve exchange about sport science in Austria
to identify whether the teamwork could continue on some topics after the Congress with the support of the ?SG

Eventually, 42 Congress delegates signed up for the workshop and could choose to work on one of the following challenges: ¡°physical inactivity at the work place¡±, ¡°physical inactivity in children¡±, ¡°image of sport science in society¡±, ¡°role of exercise therapists in medical teams¡±, ¡°influence of menstrual cycle on athletic performance¡±, ¡°health awareness in society¡±, ¡°inclusion of bodily disabled individuals as participants in public sport events¡±, and ¡°integration of girls and women with migration background through sports¡±. This format of collaboration may provide a framework for future interdisciplinary initiatives within the ?SG and beyond.
The Congress abstracts ¨C Comparing the identified challenges with actual research topics at the ?SG Congress
Having identified current challenges for sport science, it seemed of interest to compare those challenges with the content of the submitted scientific contributions to the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. The Congress received 78 contributions including 60 regular abstracts, 12 Young Investigator Award submissions and 6 extended abstracts. Five section editors managed the peer-review process and drew on the expertise of 45 peer reviewers. Each contribution was evaluated and rated by two independent reviewers. Critical feedback of reviewers had to be addressed by the authors in revised abstract submissions. Following the revision round, 75 contributions were accepted for presentation at the Congress. The contributions spanned a wide range of research areas including ¡°biomechanics, motor control & sports technology¡± (26% of abstracts), ¡°sport psychology & pedagogy¡± (25%), ¡°sports medicine, exercise therapy & public health¡± (20%), ¡°sports physiology & exercise science¡± (16%), ¡°sports sociology, economy & management¡± (14%). Of all contributions, 64 were presented orally and 11 as poster presentations while 65 abstracts were published in the Congress proceedings.
When applying the same code set to the abstract submission, we found a remarkable similarity to the survey findings in that 34% of abstracts fell into the category of ¡°prevention and rehabilitation¡± (blue bars in Figure 1). However, we also found clear mismatches: the content of the abstracts focused much more on ¡°technological progress¡± (21% vs. 2% in survey), and ¡°elite sports¡± (15% vs. 2% in survey). Further, while 23% of the survey respondents highlighted challenges in ¡°job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy¡±, none of the conference abstracts addressed this topic, indicating a gap between perceived challenges and ongoing research.
Summary and outlook
At this year¡¯s ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science by taking a problem-based approach to sport science. Based on a pre-Congress survey, we identified key challenges within sports and society in general that should be addressed by sport scientists. The most frequently mentioned challenges were related to the topic of ¡°rehabilitation and prevention¡±, specifically physical inactivity in children and at the workplace. At the Congress, delegates participated in an ¡°Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop¡± to work on the identified challenges and transform them into more approachable and specific problems. Interestingly, the topic of ¡°rehabilitation and prevention over the lifespan¡± was also dominant in a third of scientific contributions to the Congress, showing alignment between perceived challenges and research efforts in the ?SG community. In contrast, the topics of ¡°elite sports¡± and ¡°technological progress¡± were highly represented in Congress abstracts but were not perceived as current challenges in the survey. In turn, more than 20% of survey respondents perceived challenges related to the job profile of sport science alumn",Semantic Scholar,99.76198991,10.36950/2024.4ciss001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c21f47d337124b66c40f5687dfbd9bdb6a280493,2024,Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),ok,CR-biblio:  Published in the Critical Finance Review (11): 2022,,10.36950/2024.4ciss001,,Goal 3,0.029806389,FALSE,

For the purpose of this editorial, we understand interdisciplinarity as a collaboration between individuals from different scientific disciplines but also from different professions with the goal of combining knowledge and methods to create new solutions for complex societal problems. This can range from the simple communication of ideas and experiences to mutual integration of concepts, methodologies, procedures, or data sharing (Zai? et al., 2021). We think that sport scientists can and should take a leading role in such collaborations given their unique cross-disciplinary education related to human health, performance, and well-being. Leadership in interdisciplinary collaborations may be an opportunity for us as sport scientists to strengthen our profile and image in the society and to take responsibility in addressing societal challenges (Hottenrott et al., 2017).
In preparation of this year¡¯s ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace this idea of interdisciplinarity in sport science. Before the event, we conducted an online survey across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) to identify current societal challenges that sport science should address and help with developing solutions. In parallel, we assessed the perceived importance of interdisciplinary work among sport scientists and related professions. Potential respondents to the survey were mainly contacted through the communication channels of the ?SG and its equivalent associations in Germany (dvs) and Switzerland (SGS). Consequently, respondents included sport scientists as well as professionals from other fields who follow or are part of the activities of sport science associations. The findings of the survey were used in three different ways and will be described in this editorial:

to summarize the most frequently mentioned challenges and topics that sport science should address and help with developing solutions,
to develop an ¡°Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop¡± for the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 where delegates transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved, and
to compare the survey results with the content of the scientific abstracts submitted to the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024 and determine the alignment between the identified challenges and current research topics within the ?SG community.

The survey ¨C Current challenges for sport science and beyond
The survey responses were analyzed in MAXQDA 24 (VERBI software, 2021). The MAXQDA AI-Assist tool was used to suggest an initial coding scheme to group responses into categories. Two researchers refined the scheme into a final code set, independently coded the participants¡¯ responses, and discussed mismatches to agree on the final code assignments. The survey yielded 176 responses, of which 85 were fully completed. Respondents (42% women) had a mean age of 40.2 years (¡À 13.8). Regarding their primary professional field, 34% identified as scientists working at a university, college, or research institution, 26% were healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians or therapists), 15% worked in the private sector including self-employment, 13% were students or educators, and 12% were either coaches, athletes, or employed within a sports federation. 91% reported that interdisciplinarity was a key component of their work.
The most frequently mentioned challenges fell into the category of ¡°prevention and rehabilitation¡± (34%), followed by ¡°job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy¡± (23%), ¡°sport science mission for research and education¡± (11%), ¡°broader societal issues¡± (5%), ¡°structural development of organized and non-organized sports¡± (5%), ¡°inclusion and integration through sports¡± (4%), ¡°self-awareness and self-reflection¡± (3%), ¡°technological progress¡± (2%), ¡°financing¡± (2%), and ¡°elite sports¡± (2%; orange bars in Figure 1). Coding was not possible for 5% of the answers.
The workshop ¨C Transforming challenges into specific problems
Building on the findings of the survey, we collaborated with the ikivox collective (Nyon, France, https://ikivox.org/en/) to develop an ¡°Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop¡± held at the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. With the help of ikivox who specialize in collective intelligence and collaborative design approaches, we designed a workshop with the following objectives:

to transform the identified challenges into specific problems that can be solved with innovative solutions
to experience interdisciplinary collaboration and new ways of working together
to position the Austrian Sport Science Society (?SG) as an enabler, bringing value to its members to improve exchange about sport science in Austria
to identify whether the teamwork could continue on some topics after the Congress with the support of the ?SG

Eventually, 42 Congress delegates signed up for the workshop and could choose to work on one of the following challenges: ¡°physical inactivity at the work place¡±, ¡°physical inactivity in children¡±, ¡°image of sport science in society¡±, ¡°role of exercise therapists in medical teams¡±, ¡°influence of menstrual cycle on athletic performance¡±, ¡°health awareness in society¡±, ¡°inclusion of bodily disabled individuals as participants in public sport events¡±, and ¡°integration of girls and women with migration background through sports¡±. This format of collaboration may provide a framework for future interdisciplinary initiatives within the ?SG and beyond.
The Congress abstracts ¨C Comparing the identified challenges with actual research topics at the ?SG Congress
Having identified current challenges for sport science, it seemed of interest to compare those challenges with the content of the submitted scientific contributions to the ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024. The Congress received 78 contributions including 60 regular abstracts, 12 Young Investigator Award submissions and 6 extended abstracts. Five section editors managed the peer-review process and drew on the expertise of 45 peer reviewers. Each contribution was evaluated and rated by two independent reviewers. Critical feedback of reviewers had to be addressed by the authors in revised abstract submissions. Following the revision round, 75 contributions were accepted for presentation at the Congress. The contributions spanned a wide range of research areas including ¡°biomechanics, motor control & sports technology¡± (26% of abstracts), ¡°sport psychology & pedagogy¡± (25%), ¡°sports medicine, exercise therapy & public health¡± (20%), ¡°sports physiology & exercise science¡± (16%), ¡°sports sociology, economy & management¡± (14%). Of all contributions, 64 were presented orally and 11 as poster presentations while 65 abstracts were published in the Congress proceedings.
When applying the same code set to the abstract submission, we found a remarkable similarity to the survey findings in that 34% of abstracts fell into the category of ¡°prevention and rehabilitation¡± (blue bars in Figure 1). However, we also found clear mismatches: the content of the abstracts focused much more on ¡°technological progress¡± (21% vs. 2% in survey), and ¡°elite sports¡± (15% vs. 2% in survey). Further, while 23% of the survey respondents highlighted challenges in ¡°job profiles related to sport science and exercise therapy¡±, none of the conference abstracts addressed this topic, indicating a gap between perceived challenges and ongoing research.
Summary and outlook
At this year¡¯s ?SG Congress in Innsbruck 2024, we tried to embrace interdisciplinarity in sport science by taking a problem-based approach to sport science. Based on a pre-Congress survey, we identified key challenges within sports and society in general that should be addressed by sport scientists. The most frequently mentioned challenges were related to the topic of ¡°rehabilitation and prevention¡±, specifically physical inactivity in children and at the workplace. At the Congress, delegates participated in an ¡°Interdisciplinary Innovation Workshop¡± to work on the identified challenges and transform them into more approachable and specific problems. Interestingly, the topic of ¡°rehabilitation and prevention over the lifespan¡± was also dominant in a third of scientific contributions to the Congress, showing alignment between perceived challenges and research efforts in the ?SG community. In contrast, the topics of ¡°elite sports¡± and ¡°technological progress¡± were highly represented in Congress abstracts but were not perceived as current challenges in the survey. In turn, more than 20% of survey respondents perceived challenges related to the job profile of sport science alumn",Semantic Scholar,99.9991177,10.36950/2024.4ciss001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c21f47d337124b66c40f5687dfbd9bdb6a280493,2024,Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),ok,CR-biblio:Published in the Critical Finance Review (11): 2022 .,,10.36950/2024.4ciss001,,Goal 3,0.029806389,FALSE,

Patatoukas,Published in the Columbia Business Law Review (January) 2022.,2022,Published in the Columbia Business Law Review (January) 2022.,"The Song Hinh - Tay Hoa area harbors exceptional ecological and biodiversity values. Two characteristic forest ecosystems are represented: lowland and mid-montane evergreen tropical forests, which collectively support remarkable biodiversity, comprising 1,163 vascular plant species, 58 mammalian species, 219 bird species, 125 reptile and amphibian species, and 65 freshwater fish species. Of these, 41 plant species, 20 mammal species, 32 bird species, 14 reptile species, 6 amphibian species, and 6 freshwater fish species are listed as Near Threatened or higher on the IUCN Red List (2025), the Vietnam Red Data Book (2024), and Government Decree No. 84/2021/ND-CP. A defining feature of the area is its high level of endemism, including several narrowly distributed taxa recorded exclusively within the site. In comparison with the ecological and biological criteria stipulated in the current Law on Biodiversity and the Law on Forestry, the area exceeds the thresholds required, thereby meeting both scientific and practical conditions for designation as a provincial- or national-level nature reserve. Drawing upon these research findings and the integrated analysis of landscape and ecosystem maps, a proposal is made for the establishment of a nature reserve, comprising three functional zones: a strictly protected core (13,708 ha), an ecological restoration zone (23,037 ha), and an administrative and service area (362 ha).

While the conventional view emphasizes the negatives of major customer dependency for client business risk, we find that suppliers with more concentrated customer bases spend less on audit fees. The evidence is consistent with reduced audit effort due to efficiency gains in the audit process, especially when suppliers with more concentrated customer bases share the same auditors with their long-standing major customers. The audit fee discount we identify does not imply that audit quality declines with customer-base concentration. In fact, we find that suppliers with more concentrated customer bases are less likely to experience material restatements of previously audited financial statements. Taking the external auditors' perspective, our study provides new managerial insights on the costs and benefits of major customer relationships for supplier firms.

Patatoukas,Published in Production and Operations Management Journal 25 (2): 2016.,2016,Published in Production and Operations Management Journal 25 (2): 2016.,"Goal: This study seeks to examine project success in relation to project managers¡¯ factors. Pertaining to research questions, we highlighted: ¡°do project manager¡¯s technical, conceptual, political and human skills are significantly related to project success?, and does project manager¡¯s age play a significant role in achieving project success? Design / Methodology / Approach: This research employed a quantitative research method using survey questionnaires to collect data from 400 project managers working in five well-known construction companies in Cairo, Egypt. Descriptive statistics using Relative Importance Index (RII) were employed to rank the dimensions of project manager¡¯s skills: conceptual, technical, human and political skills; and project success dimensions: cost, schedule and quality. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the impact of project managers¡¯ skills on project success while simple linear regression was used to examine the relationship between project manager¡¯s age and project success Results: The results of RII revealed that project managers maintain a competitive level of technical, conceptual, political and human skills, and emphasize on specific aspects of cost, schedule, and quality dimensions of project success. The regression analysis revealed that 49.2% of the explained variation in project success can be accounted for technical, political, human and conceptual skills at coefficient of determination values of 0.611, 0.506, 0.431 and 0.407 respectively while the project manager¡¯s age had no association with project success with a P value 0.694 at alpha level of 0.05. Limitations of the investigation: Generalizing research findings might be challenged because sample size was randomly selected due lack of identifying the exact size target population. Practical implications: The managerial implication of this study lies in the need for construction companies not to consider project manager¡¯s age as a significant factor for project success, instead they need to ensure that project managers possess a competitive level of conceptual, technical, political and human skills. Originality / Value: Pertaining to contribution to academia, this research argues that project success subject to a set of comprehensive set of project managerial skills namely conceptual, technical, political and human. Further, it is essential to distinguish between project manager¡¯s age and experience and not to consider project manager¡¯s age as a determinant of a project success. Keyword: Project Manager¡¯s Skills; Project Manager¡¯s Age; Project Success; Construction Industry. INTRODUCTION Many organizations rely on projects to run operations and sustain their business success. Construction companies rely on projects to deliver a unique product or services to their The Impact of Project Manager¡¯s Skills and Age on Project Success Brazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management, Vol. 18, No. 4, e2021950, 2021 2/16 customers. Construction companies rely on managing projects in their business activities and establishment of houses, apartments, condominiums, villas, schools, hospitals, bridges, airport, stores, malls, and roads. In handling a specific construction project, construction companies need to assign a project manager with relevant skills to ensure project success. Research acknowledges the significant role of project managers¡¯ skills in achieving project success (Hwang and Ng, 2013; Sunindijo, 2015). Construction industry is one of the fundamental industries in Egypt with a remarkable impact on economic development and creation of employment opportunities. Egyptian government emphasizes the influential role of infrastructure and construction as the main drivers of financial stability and urban growth. Despite Covid-19 had a negative impact on construction industry, the demand for infrastructure and housing and infrastructure remain stable as the country¡¯s population continues to increase. According to a report by Oxford Business Group (2020), the Egyptian construction industry is expected to achieve longer-term growth driven by the growing trend of urbanisation and government support to double Egypt¡¯s urban area from 7% to 14% by 2052. Based on a recent Fitch Ratings report, the Egyptian construction sector will continue its strong position throughout the next decade with a 9% annual growth rate between the years 2020-2024 (Refaat, 2020). Further, Refaat (2020) reported that the value of the current Egyptian construction industry is about 25 billion USD and estimated to reach more than $ 89 billion by 2029 that represent about 30% of the value of the construction industry in the Middle East and North Africa region. Researchers and professional believe that the project manager is a very essential element to the success of the construction project and have an impact at every stage of the construction project as argued by Ali and Chileshe (2009). Within today's competitive market, the recognition and growth of project managers ' skills is becoming increasingly important (Omidvar et al, 2012). El-sokhn and Othman (2014) argued that the construction sector is regarded for its persistent problems of fragmentation, low productivity, time and value overruns; bad safety, inferior working conditions, and inadequate excellent which finally leads to project failure and terrible development images. A project manager needs knowledge and expertise to handle the construction project effectively and efficiently (Hwang and Ng, 2013). A project manager with integrity is important to the necessity and progress of the project. This study was centered on the assumption that project success can be predicted by project managers¡¯ skills guided by Blaskovics (2016) argumentation that project managers play a key part in achieving project success. Subsequent sections present a brief review of the literature considering project success, project manager¡¯s skills and age along with hypotheses development. LITERATURE REVIEW This section presents a review of the literature on project success, relationship between project managers¡¯ skills and project managers¡¯ age and project success. Project Success The success of construction projects is an important issue for most governments, users and communities. Muller (2007) indicated that the projects vary in size, uniqueness and difficulty. Although many papers on project success have been published, there is no consensus on it (Jiang et al, 2016). In modern construction projects, customers and contractors are having great difficulty completing the project due to the increasing complexity in designing and involving stakeholders (Doloi, 2009).

We construct measures of community vibrancy based on a unique dataset of block party permit approvals from the City of Philadelphia. Our first measure captures the overall volume of block party events in a neighborhood whereas our second measure captures differences in the type (regular versus spontaneous) of block party activities. We use both regression modeling and propensity score matching to control for the economic, demographic and land use characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood when examining the relationship between crime and our two measures of community vibrancy. We conduct our analysis on aggregate levels of crime and community vibrancy from 2006 to 2015 as well as the trends in community vibrancy and crime over this time period. We find that neighborhoods with a higher number of block parties have a significantly higher crime rate, while those holding a greater proportion of spontaneous block party events have a significantly lower crime rate. We also find that neighborhoods which have an increase in the proportion of spontaneous block parties over time are significantly more likely to have a decreasing trend in total crime incidence over that same time period.",Semantic Scholar,100,10.1371/journal.pone.0257530,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/adcbec7ffd2bc8aafd9b6732e452e3d0f9a85418,2020,PLoS ONE,ok,"CR-biblio:Wichinpong Park Sinchaisri, Shane T.

Using a randomized field experiment conducted in Argentina, we find that temporary financial incentives paid to health clinics for the early initiation of prenatal care motivated providers to test and develop new strategies to locate and encourage pregnant women to seek care in the first trimester of pregnancy. These innovations raised the rate of early initiation of prenatal care by 34 percent while the incentives were being paid in the treatment period. We also find that this increase persisted for at least 24 months after the incentives ended. We show that this is consistent with the presence of up-front costs from adjusting care processes that made it too expensive to develop and implement new strategies to increase early initiation of care in the absence of the incentives. Despite large increases in early initiation of prenatal care, we find no effects on health outcomes.

Using preregistered lab experiments, they replicate the main effect and propose one underlying mechanism: Referred customers perceive referring to be more socially appropriate than nonreferred customers do.

Effect estimates were adjusted for age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, educational level, gestational age and season at urine collection, and ECHO cohort. Participants were classified as Hispanic of any race (n?=?1658), non-Hispanic White (n?=?1478), non-Hispanic Black (n?=?490), and non-Hispanic Other (n?=?362), which included individuals of multiple races. Urinary 2,4-DCP and 2,5-DCP concentrations were 2- to 4-fold higher among Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic Other participants relative to non-Hispanic White participants. MePb was ~2-fold higher among non-Hispanic Black (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7¨C3.1) and non-Hispanic Other (95% CI: 1.5¨C2.8) participants. PrPb was similarly higher among non-Hispanic Black (95% CI: 1.7¨C3.7) and non-Hispanic Other (95% CI: 1.3¨C3.1) participants.

By studying the interactional and emergent properties of multiple identities that go beyond the sum of identities, as well as understanding the complex nature of power and privilege, social psychologists can better understand processes such as stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. Yet it can be difficult for researchers to know exactly where to begin.

However, there has been relatively little work on whether these normative stereotypes are equally attributed to men and women of different identities. Across two studies (total N = 928), we assessed the extent to which stereotypes are prescribed and proscribed for men and women of different sexual orientations (Study 1) and races (Study 2) in the United States. We asked participants to rate the desirability of possessing 70 traits based on an ¡°average American.¡± Although results showed the persistence of gender normative stereotypes in society, the normative nature of these stereotypes was influenced by sexual orientation and race. There was strong evidence of a heterocentric bias, as normative stereotypes of generic men and women most closely aligned with those of straight men and women. There was weaker evidence of a Eurocentric bias. Furthermore, observed gender differences in normative stereotypes were significantly smaller for sexually- and racially-minoritized targets compared to straight and White targets. These findings combined suggest that the practices and policies that attempt to address gender inequality might not be as effective for people with multiply-marginalized identities that face distinctly different patterns of normative pressures.

To assess the toxicity of the herbicide, including the median lethal concentration (LC50) at 24h, the no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC), and the lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC), tadpoles were exposed to five nominal concentrations of DG? (5.0, 6.2, 7.8, 9.8, and 12.2 mg/L), and to dechlorinated water as a negative control (NC). The LC5024h of DG? was 7.0 mg/L, the NOEC was 5.0 mg/L and the LOEC=6.2 mg/L.

Advance Online publication.",2023,"Of Christians, Jews, and Muslims: When gender is unspecified, the default is men","Objective: Discrimination against members of non-majority religious groups is widespread, often due to negative stereotypes and emotions toward them. To understand the impact of gender on religious stereotypes and emotions, across two studies, we analyzed stereotypes and emotions towards the men and women of three religious groups: Christians, Jews, and Muslims, to determine the presence of prototypicality biases using intersectional invisibility as the guiding framework. Methods: In Study 1 (pre-registered, n = 893), participants rated religious groups on four stereotype dimensions of Competence, Warmth, Beliefs, and Americanness, with religion as a within-subject variable and gender as a between-subject variable. In Study 2 (pre-registered, n = 915), participants rated religious groups on six emotional dimensions. Results: There was evidence of androcentric biases, as (Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) men were perceived as more similar to their respective broader religious groups than (Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) women. Additionally, Muslim women, in particular, experienced a double distancing from their identities: they were strongly differentiated from their broader religious category, i.e., Muslim, and from their broader gender category, i.e., women. Discussion: While much is known regarding religious groups as a whole, there is relatively little work disaggregating religious groups by gender.

In five studies (N=1858), we explored sexual health stereotypes about gay men and lesbian women and their implications in prejudice/discrimination. In Studies 1, 2A, and 2B, we found people explicitly associated gay men with promiscuity and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) more than lesbian women or straight men/women. In implicit association tests, both gay men and lesbian women were more associated with promiscuity and STIs than straight counterparts. Studies 3A and 3B showed that these associations have consequences: people expressed more prejudice and discrimination towards gay men and lesbian women with STIs versus those with non-STIs or straight counterparts with either disease type. Taken together, the current research identifies some psychological factors that may underpin health disparities and healthcare barriers for gay and lesbian people.",Crossref,100,10.31234/osf.io/kbgwm,https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kbgwm,2021,,ok,CR-biblio:Rice 2021 Gay = STIs?

People spontaneously compare themselves to others in terms of relative status and power, not only as individuals but also as members of groups relative to other groups. Using a social dominance framework, the authors discuss the impact of such comparisons on socio-political attitudes and behavior. Social dominance theory describes how certain attitudes, values, and social practices enhance group hierarchies, whereas other attitudes, values, and social practices are hierarchy-attenuating. Power differentials within any type of group hierarchy are given by the balance between these forces that play out at three levels of analysis: in societal institutions (macro level), in intergroup relations (meso level), and among different individuals (micro level). The authors discuss not only how social comparisons shape hierarchy-enhancing and hierarchy-attenuating outcomes at each level but also how these outcomes, in turn, can mute the natural consequences of group-based power comparisons.",Crossref,100,10.1093/oso/9780190629113.003.0020,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190629113.003.0020,2020,"Social Comparison, Judgment, and Behavior",ok,CR-biblio:Bergh 2020 Social Dominance Theory and Power Comparison,Social Dominance Theory and Power Comparison,10.1093/oso/9780190629113.003.0020,,Goal 1,0.054915546,FALSE,social cohesion

Social dominance orientation (SDO), or the extent to which people prefer and promote group-based inequalities, is an ideological variable that is associated with a competitive view of the world, increased prejudicial attitudes, and decreased empathy. Thus, higher levels of SDO should be associated with reduced empathy and increased counter-empathy in general, but especially towards those whose subjugation maintains group inequalities. Across three studies we show that among White individuals, higher SDO levels are associated with less empathy, and more counter-empathy in response to others¡¯ good and bad fortunes. More importantly, these reductions in empathy and increases in schadenfreude as a function of SDO were significantly stronger for Asian and Black targets than for in-group White targets when group boundaries were made salient prior to the empathy ratings. Finally, in a fourth study we show that this phenomenon is not dependent upon a history of status differences: higher SDO scores were associated with decreased empathy and increased counter-empathy for competitive out-group (relative to in-group) targets in a novel group setting.

Recent work shows that this tendency emerges surprisingly early: children as young as 3-years-old provide adult-like assessments of others on character attributes such as ""nice,"" ""strong,"" and ""smart"" based only on subtle variations in targets' face shape and physiognomy (i.e., latent face-traits). The present research examined the behavioral consequences of children's face-trait judgments by asking whether, and if so when in development, the appearance of face-traits also (a) shapes children's judgments of targets' behaviors and (b) guides children's behavior toward targets. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that, by 3 years of age, children used facial features in character evaluations but not in judgments of targets' behavior, whereas by 5 years of age, children reliably made both character and behavior judgments from face-traits. Age-related change in behavior judgments was also observed in children's own behaviors toward targets: Experiments 3 and 4 showed that, by age 5 (but not earlier), children were more likely to give gifts to targets with trustworthy and submissive-looking faces (Experiment 3) and showed concordance between their character evaluations and gift-giving behaviors (Experiment 4). These findings newly suggest that, although children may rapidly make character evaluations from face-trait appearance, predicting and performing social behaviors based on face-traits may require more developed and specific understanding of traits and their relationships to behaviors. Nevertheless, by kindergarten, even relatively arbitrary and subtle face-traits appear to have meaningful consequences in shaping children's social judgments and interactions.

This chapter argues that while intersectionalist and critical race theorists have qualitatively (and occasionally quantitatively) drawn attention to the fact that the racial and gender dimensions of oppression are both interactively implicated in the maintenance of group-based inequality, a fully satisfactory empirical analysis of the dynamics of racism and sexism has yet to be achieved. Using the theoretical frameworks of evolutionary psychology and social dominance theory (SDT), this chapter offers an alternative understanding of the intersectional entanglement of racism and sexism.

A significant consequence of this prediction is the emergence of quantized current steps, so-called dual Shapiro steps, when synchronizing Bloch oscillations to an external microwave signal. These steps potentially enable a fundamental standard of current I, defined via the frequency f of the external signal and the elementary charge e, I = ¡À n ¡Á 2ef, where n is a natural number.

Inspired by today¡¯s voltage standards and to further confirm the duality relation, we investigate a pulsed drive regime and observe an asymmetric pattern of dual Shapiro steps. This work confirms quantum duality effects in Josephson junctions and paves the way towards a range of applications in quantum metrology based on well-established fabrication techniques and straightforward circuit design.

Here we examine emissions targets that ended in 2020 to investigate the final target outcomes, the transparency of target outcomes and potential consequences for missed emissions targets. A total of 1,041 firms had emissions targets ending in 2020, of which 88 (9%) failed and 320 (31%) disappeared. We find limited accountability and low awareness of the target outcomes. Only three of the failed firms are covered by the media. After a firm fails its 2020 emissions target, we do not observe significant market reaction, changes in media sentiment, environmental scores and environment-related shareholder proposals. In contrast, initial announcements of these 2020 emissions targets are rewarded with significant improvements in media sentiment and environmental scores. Our findings raise concerns for the accountability of emissions targets ending in 2030 and 2050. Companies have set emissions reduction targets globally, yet whether they are held accountable for the outcomes remains uncertain.

We collect field data through unannounced visits to a sample of microentrepreneurs in select areas of Uganda, combining surveys of business owners and real customers, as well as purchases by confederate buyers (i.e., mystery shoppers). We document that childcare duties in businesses are highly gendered: 37% of female owners bring small children to work, compared with 0% of men. Childcare duties are correlated with a ¡°baby-profit gap,¡± as businesses where children are present earn 48% lower profits than even other female-owned businesses where a child is not present. Using our rich data, we analyze potential reasons why childcare obligations may affect profits.

However, we find that women with children in the store are more likely to run out of stock than both men and women who do not have children in the store.

Here, we propose a filter strategy to rapidly identify the majority of relevant pathogenic mutations.Methods:Our strategy was developed using WES data from eight consanguineous and five fictive nonconsanguineous couples and was subsequently applied to 20 other fictive nonconsanguineous couples. Presumably pathogenic variants based on frequency and database annotations or generic characteristics and mutation type were selected in genes shared by the couple and in the female¡¯s X-chromosome. Unclassified variants were not included.Results:This yielded an average of 29 (19¨C51) variants in genes shared by the consanguineous couples and 15 (6¨C30) shared by the nonconsanguineous couples. For X-linked variants, the numbers per female were 3 (1¨C5) and 1 (0¨C3), respectively. Remaining variants were verified manually. The majority were able to be quickly discarded, effectively leaving true pathogenic variants.Conclusion:We conclude that WES is applicable for PCS, both for consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples, with the remaining number of variants being manageable in a clinical setting. The addition of gene panels for filtering was not favorable because it resulted in missing pathogenic variants. It is important to develop and continuously curate databases with pathogenic mutations to further increase the sensitivity of WES-based PCS.Genet Med advance online publication 27 October 2016",Semantic Scholar,7.0989,10.1038/gim.2016.153,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58d44ad044da42d3abcd20a3cecfbe75e694bec6,2016,Genetics in Medicine,ok,"CR-biblio:  3: 1-19, 2016",,10.1038/gim.2016.153,,Goal 5,0.004229273,FALSE,

Global Strategy Journal . 2022,2022,A Wider-Aperture Lens for Global Strategic Management: The Multinational Enterprise in a Bifurcated Global Economy,"Research Summary The growth of China and President Xi's policies have transformed the global economy in ways that global strategy and international business (IB) scholars have yet to reflect fully in their research. The global economy is increasingly bifurcated between a China©\centered authoritarian system and a market©\oriented democratic system, generating complications and perils largely unknown since the end of the Cold War. The global business environment now bears faint resemblance to existing models in IB. To properly analyze the new reality, global strategy and IB scholars need to adopt a wider©\aperture, systems©\theoretic view that will require the cross©\fertilization of ideas and collaboration with other disciplines such as international political economy. This engagement will allow the development of more broadly based frameworks, theories, and models that can assist decision makers in the private and public sectors. Managerial Summary Strategic rivalry between China and the West requires managers to face a new reckoning. China remains the world's factory, but it has a tenuous relationship to even©\handed rules of law, both domestically and internationally. China leverages access to its market and has aligned with other autocratic countries to reshape the world order. Many firms have straddled the divide and tried to play by two sets of rules. This is not viable longer term. The strategic decisions of Western firms, particularly those involved with advanced and, especially, dual©\use technologies, are consequential to the future of democracy. A systemic view of the long©\term health of the enterprise may reveal the need to choose.

Economic analysis in the field of industrial organization remains largely focused on a sophisticated version of the Schumpeter¨CArrow debate, which is unresolved and largely irrelevant. We posit the need to look at competition anew. Static models of monopoly firms and markets in equilibrium are often used to characterize Big Tech firms¡¯ size and scope. We suggest that this characterization is inappropriate because the growth and diversification of many digital firms lead to a situation of broad-spectrum competition that cuts across markets. Current market positions do not reflect entrenched monopoly power but are vulnerable to competitive pressure of disequilibrating forces arising from the use of data-driven operating models, astute resource orchestration, and the exercise of dynamic capabilities. A few strategic errors by management in the handling of internal transitions and/or external challenges and they could be competitively impaired. The implications of a more dynamic understanding of the competition process in the tech sector are explored. We consider how big data and entrepreneurial management impacts firm performance. We also explore the nature of different types of rents (Schumpeterian, Ricardian, and monopoly rents) and suggest a modified long-term consumer welfare standard for competition policy.

The systems approach received attention from management scholars in the middle of the last century, but, since then, has been largely abandoned. Meanwhile, academic disciplines have continued to narrow their focus. The capabilities and systems frameworks both adopt a holistic view that calls for all elements of an organization to be in alignment, and both recognize the importance of some form of learning for the purpose of adaptation. Dynamic capabilities go further by recognizing that organizations not only adapt to the business environment, they often try to shape it, too. While systems theory emphasizes internal stability over time and homogeneity across similar systems, dynamic capabilities include an explicit role for management/leadership that allows systemic change to start from within, which is the source of heterogeneity across firms. Dynamic capabilities are part of a system that includes resources and strategy.

The Journal of Finance . 2020",2020,"Timothy McQuade, Adam Guren, Arvind Krishnamurthy","How can mortgages be redesigned or modified in a crisis to reduce housing market volatility, consumption volatility, and default? We answer these questions using a quantitative general equilibrium life cycle model with aggregate shocks in which households have realistic long-term mortgages and a rich set of choices as to whether to prepay, refinance, move, or default, and household and lender decisions aggregate up to determine house prices. The calibrated model is used to quantitatively assess how different mortgage contracts affect housing market volatility, particularly in busts like the Great Recession. In this preliminary draft, we focus on comparing fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Although FRMs allow homeowners to increase consumption by locking in a low rate, this effect is swamped by the insurance benefits of ARMs in a crisis. ARMs reduce default and improves consumption smoothing, particularly for young and high LTV homeowners. Quantitatively, in a crisis episode defaults are 50 percent lower with ARMs, and over five years the cumulative consumption-equivalent welfare loss under ARMs is 20 percent of annual consumption. These findings suggest that welfare could be improved dramatically by introducing the insurance features of ARMs into mortgage designs.",Semantic Scholar,96.96969697,10.3386/W24446,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06834b80bbab689e4dce4d2f000c937ea4f6f6f5,2018,Journal of Finance,ok,"CR-biblio:Timothy McQuade, Adam Guren, Arvind Krishnamurthy.

We identify local demand shocks by linking fluctuations in global commodity prices to municipality-level agricultural endowments in Brazil.

Review of Economic Studies . 2020",2020,"Timothy McQuade, Adam Guren","How can mortgages be redesigned or modified in a crisis to reduce housing market volatility, consumption volatility, and default? We answer these questions using a quantitative general equilibrium life cycle model with aggregate shocks in which households have realistic long-term mortgages and a rich set of choices as to whether to prepay, refinance, move, or default, and household and lender decisions aggregate up to determine house prices. The calibrated model is used to quantitatively assess how different mortgage contracts affect housing market volatility, particularly in busts like the Great Recession. In this preliminary draft, we focus on comparing fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Although FRMs allow homeowners to increase consumption by locking in a low rate, this effect is swamped by the insurance benefits of ARMs in a crisis. ARMs reduce default and improves consumption smoothing, particularly for young and high LTV homeowners. Quantitatively, in a crisis episode defaults are 50 percent lower with ARMs, and over five years the cumulative consumption-equivalent welfare loss under ARMs is 20 percent of annual consumption. These findings suggest that welfare could be improved dramatically by introducing the insurance features of ARMs into mortgage designs.",Semantic Scholar,91.81818182,10.3386/W24446,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06834b80bbab689e4dce4d2f000c937ea4f6f6f5,2018,Journal of Finance,ok,"CR-biblio:Timothy McQuade, Adam Guren.

A large and growing literature examines whether these costs are disproportionately borne by different sectors of the economy and/or across different groups of individuals. However, much less is known about how the environmental benefits created by these policies are distributed, which mirror the differences in environmental damages associated with existing environmental externalities. We review this burgeoning literature and develop a simple general framework for empirical analysis. We apply this framework to findings concerning the distributional impacts of environmental damages from air pollution, deforestation, and climate change and highlight priorities for future research. A recurring challenge to understanding the distributional effects of environmental damages is distinguishing between cases in which populations are exposed to different levels or changes in an environmental good and those in which an incremental change in the environment may have very different implications for some populations. In the latter case, it is often difficult to empirically identify the underlying sources of heterogeneity in marginal damages because damages may stem from nonlinear and/or heterogeneous damage functions. Nevertheless, understanding the determinants of heterogeneity in environmental benefits and damages is crucial for welfare analysis and policy design.",Semantic Scholar,99.98979869,10.1093/reep/rey024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b18399401ac91ccd7f8cf62397ad1f053c0e368f,2017,Review of Environmental Economics and Policy,ok,"CR-biblio:Reed Walker, Solomon Hsiang, and Paulina Oliva.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 2017",2017,"Reed Walker, Adam Isen, and Maya Rossin-Slater","Significance Recent work has demonstrated how exposure to extreme temperatures influences contemporaneous health outcomes, such as infant mortality and morbidity. Additional research has explored how shocks to the early-life environment affect long-run human capital outcomes. However, there is little evidence on the possible long-term consequences of exposure to extreme temperatures in utero or in early childhood. This paper begins to fill this gap by studying long-run effects of temperature on measures of individuals¡¯ economic wellbeing around age 30 y. We find that adult economic outcomes are negatively correlated with prenatal exposure to days with mean temperatures exceeding 32 ¡ãC. This relationship is completely mitigated among individuals born in counties with high rates of access to air conditioning. We study how exposure to extreme temperatures in early periods of child development is related to adult economic outcomes measured 30 y later. Our analysis uses administrative earnings records for over 12 million individuals born in the United States between 1969 and 1977, linked to fine-scale, daily weather data and location and date of birth. We calculate the length of time each individual is exposed to different temperatures in utero and in early childhood, and we estimate flexible regression models that allow for nonlinearities in the relationship between temperature and long-run outcomes.

A major challenge in burst-denoising is in coping with pixel misalignment, which was so far handled with rather simplistic assumptions of simple motion, or the ability to align in pre-processing. Such assumptions are not realistic in the presence of large motion and high levels of noise. We show that Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), originally suggested for physics-based novel-view rendering, can serve as a powerful framework for burst denoising. NeRFs have an inherent capability of handling noise as they integrate information from multiple images, but they are limited in doing so, mainly since they build on pixel-wise operations which are suitable to ideal imaging conditions. Our approach, termed NAN111Refer to the project website: noise-aware-nerf.github.io, leverages inter-view and spatial information in NeRFs to better deal with noise.

Different from traditional recommendation, takeaway recommendation faces two main challenges: (1) Dual Interaction-Aware Preference Modeling. Traditional recommendation commonly focuses on users' single preferences for items while takeaway recommendation needs to comprehensively consider users' dual preferences for stores and foods. (2) Period-Varying Preference Modeling. Conventional recommendation generally models continuous changes in users' preferences from a session-level or day-level perspective. However, in practical takeaway systems, users' preferences vary significantly during the morning, noon, night, and late night periods of the day. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual Period-Varying Preference modeling (DPVP) for takeaway recommendation. Specifically, we design a dual interaction-aware module, aiming to capture users' dual preferences based on their interactions with stores and foods. Moreover, to model various preferences in different time periods of the day, we propose a time-based decomposition module as well as a time-aware gating mechanism. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets and it is capable of modeling the dual period-varying preferences. Moreover, our model has been deployed online on Meituan Takeaway platform, leading to an average improvement in GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) of 0.70%.",Semantic Scholar,80,10.1145/3580305.3599866,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17e3a3245957f0cfec5f122b2302750734112db4,2023,Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,ok,CR-biblio:Takeaway : U.S. corporations that are more transparent in their accounting earnings information enjoy higher stock valua,,10.1145/3580305.3599866,,Goal 1,0.005203579,FALSE,

This is because stock prices behave very differently with respect to their sensitivity to beta when markets are open for trading versus when they are closed.

These day-night relations hold for beta-sorted portfolios and individual stocks in the US and internationally as well as for industry and book-to-market portfolios and cash flow and discount rate beta-sorted portfolios.

Previous research suggested that the sequential construction of bundles encourages variety seeking. The present research revisits this claim and offers a theoretical explanation rooted in combinatorics and norm communication. When constructing a bundle, a consumer chooses among different choice permutations, but when selecting amongst prepackaged bundles, the consumer typically considers unique choice combinations. Because variety is typically overrepresented among permutations compared to combinations, certain consumers (in particular, those with similar attitudes toward items that could compose a bundle) are induced by these different numbers of pathways to variety to display more or less variety-seeking behavior. This is in part explained by the variety norms communicated by different choice architectures, cues most likely to be inferred and used by those who are indifferent between the potential bundle components and thus looking for guidance. Across 5 studies in the main text and 11 in the web appendix, this article tests this account and offers preliminary exploration of newly identified residual effects that the pathways-to-variety account cannot explain.",Crossref,100,10.1093/jcr/ucac017,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucac017,2022,Journal of Consumer Research,ok,"CR-biblio:O¡¯Donnell, M., Critcher, C.

In this paper, we analyze the short-time asymptotics of CTQWs. In recent studies, it was shown that for the classical diffusion process the short-time asymptotics of the transition probabilities follows power laws whose exponents are given by the usual combinatorial distances of the nodes. Inspired by this result, we perform a similar analysis for CTQWs in both closed and open systems, including time-dependent couplings. For time-reversal symmetric coherent quantum evolutions, the short-time asymptotics of the transition probabilities is completely determined by the topology of the underlying graph analogously to the classical case, but with a doubled power-law exponent. Moreover, this result is robust against the introduction of on-site potential terms. However, we show that time-reversal symmetry-breaking terms and noncoherent effects can significantly alter the short-time asymptotics. The analytical formulas are checked against numerics, and excellent agreement is found. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the relevance of our results for quantum evolutions on particular network topologies.",Semantic Scholar,99.9889791,10.1103/PhysRevA.100.062320,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6467fe3084de887ab7e0b6ccd7c4d91980c3f4de,2019,Physical Review A,ok,CR-biblio:continuous time behavior,,10.1103/PhysRevA.100.062320,,Goal 16,0.007004579,FALSE,

Also, improvisational decision-making, as a means for balancing or transcending the dualities of comprehensive and intuitive decision processes, enables the three strategic decision-making processes to coexist and contribute to decision-quality when in crisis.Design/methodology/approachAfter providing a general overview of comprehensive, intuitive and improvisational decision-making and introducing paradox theory, this paper offers a conceptual model of the link between improvisational decision-making and decision quality in crisis situations. Three boundary conditions are discussed: expertise in comprehensive decision-making, expertise in intuitive decision-making and the paradoxical balanced combination of comprehensive and intuitive decision-making. Two brief cases are included to illustrate the theory.FindingsAlthough comprehensive and intuitive decision-making are rooted in distinct information processing approaches with different cognitive demands and at times contradictory logics, they can be combined in unique ways when senior executives improvise decisions in crisis situations.Practical implicationsParticularly in the contexts of crises, it is critical for managers to understand the value of improvisational decision-making and the balanced combination of decision-making tools available to them in order to make rapid and quality decisions.

This study aimed to analyze the organization of echocardiographic laboratories and echocardiography practice during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, and the expectations for the post-COVID era. Methods: We analyzed two different time periods: the month of November during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) and the identical month during 2019 (November 2019). Results: During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital activity was partially reduced in 42 (60%) and wholly interrupted in 3 (4%) echocardiographic laboratories, whereas outpatient echocardiographic activity was partially reduced in 41 (59%) and completely interrupted in 7 (10%) laboratories. We observed an important change in the organization of activities in the echocardiography laboratory which reduced the operator-risk and improved self-protection of operators by using appropriate personal protection equipment. Operators wore FFP2 in 58 centers (83%) during trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), in 65 centers (93%) during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and 63 centers (90%) during stress echocardiography. The second wave caused a significant reduction in number of echocardiographic exams, compared to November 2019 (from 513 ¡À 539 to 341 ¡À 299 exams per center, ?34%, p < 0.001). On average, there was a significant increase in the outpatient waiting list for elective echocardiographic exams (from 32.0 ¡À 28.1 to 45.5 ¡À 44.9 days, +41%, p < 0.001), with a reduction of in-hospital waiting list (2.9 ¡À 2.4 to 2.4 ¡À 2.0 days, ?17%, p < 0.001). We observed a large diffusion of point-of-care cardiac ultrasound (88%), with a significant increase of lung ultrasound usage in 30 centers (43%) during 2019, extended to all centers in 2020. Carbon dioxide production by examination is an indicator of the environmental impact of technology (100-fold less with echocardiography compared to other cardiac imaging techniques). It was ignored in 2019 by 100% of centers, and currently it is considered potentially crucial for decision-making in cardiac imaging by 65 centers (93%). Conclusions: In one year, major changes occurred in echocardiography practice and culture. The examination structure changed with extensive usage of point-of-care cardiac ultrasound and with lung ultrasound embedded by default in the TTE examination, as well as the COVID-19 testing.",Semantic Scholar,99.9999901,10.3390/jcm10163466,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5205460f7b52a1436dbc18f1df6d5c7ead11799a,2021,Journal of Clinical Medicine,ok,CR-biblio:¡°The Impact of Organizational Slack on Strategic Decision Making.¡± (Working paper.),,10.3390/jcm10163466,,Goal 1,0.027640345,FALSE,COVID-19 impact

Two studies were conducted to test this general hypothesis. First, an archival study demonstrated that the stock of companies headed by charismatic leaders appreciated more than the stock of comparable companies, even after differences in corporate performance were controlled. It was also found that the effect of charismatic leadership was heightened under more difficult economic conditions. Second, an experiment was conducted in which the salience of charismatic leadership was manipulated, along with information about the prospects for an organization's turnaround. Results showed that appeals from a charismatic leader led to increased investment in the firm, and the leader's influence was greater when the prospects for an organizational turnaround were more difficult. It was also found that an endowment of stock enhanced the influence of charismatic appeals and that charismatic leadership may have affected the general risk propensities of followers. These findings were interpreted in terms of an external perspective on leadership, illustrating how leaders can manage the firm's economic and social environment.

Quarterly Journal of Economics . .We study patterns of behavior in bilateral bargaining situations using a rich new data set describing back-and-forth sequential bargaining occurring in over 25 million listings from eBay¡¯s Best Offer platform. We compare observed behavior to predictions from the large theoretical bargaining literature. One-third of bargaining interactions end in immediate agreement, as predicted by complete-information models. The majority of sequences play out differently, ending in disagreement or delayed agreement, which have been rationalized by incomplete information models. We find that stronger bargaining power and better outside options improve agents¡¯ outcomes. Robust empirical findings that existing models cannot rationalize include reciprocal (and gradual) concession behavior and delayed disagreement. Another robust pattern at odds with existing theory is that players exhibit a preference for making and accepting offers that split the difference between the two most recent offers. These observations suggest that behavioral norms, which are neither incorporated nor explained by existing theories, play an important role in the success of bargaining outcomes.",,"Matt Backus, Tom Blake, Brad Larsen, and Steven Tadelis","Bargaining breakdown is common in bargaining in environments with incomplete information.

Using this natural experiment, our difference-in-differences approach documents a 14% decrease in the rate of breakdown among compliers. Though adoption is immediate, the effect is not. We show, using text analysis, that the dynamics are consistent with repeat players learning how to use communication in bargaining.

This paper studies how medical practice acquisitions by Physician Practice Management Companies (PPMCs) impact physician behavior and patient health. PPMCs market themselves as providing physicians the economic benefits of a larger organization while preserving their autonomy over the clinical and operational decisions of their medical practices. PPMCs, however, use a variety of incentives to align physician behavior with the commercial and clinical interests of the PPMC. I analyze the effect of acquisitions on physician treatment decisions by linking hospital discharge records to hand-collected data on PPMC practice acquisitions between 2006 and 2014. Identification of difference-in-differences estimates comes from variation in the timing of acquisitions. I find that when PPMCs only incentivize financial performance, physicians increase the use of high-revenue, low-value procedures, resulting in less clinically appropriate care and worse patient outcomes. The opposite result is found when PPMCs incentivize both financial and clinical performance.

However, despite the prevalence of structured finance instruments in Europe, the network between issuers and service providers has to date remained unexplored. This paper traces and describes these connections, using a new database covering the majority of public ABSs and CBs outstanding between August 2008 and March 2017. It appears that ABS and CB issuers are highly reliant on affiliated counterparties (¡°close links¡±) to provide the above-mentioned key services, especially when programmes are larger and/or are retained by the issuer for use as collateral with the Eurosystem. When only ¡°non-close links¡± across banking groups are considered, instances of reliance on just a few service providers have gradually decreased in number, with a more balanced system developing over time. The paper finds similar results for networks based on the use of securities as Eurosystem collateral. These findings help demonstrate the importance of the Eurosystem¡¯s risk management framework for ABSs and CBs, and support the orientation of recent regulatory efforts at the European level.

Integrating fairness heuristic theory and the situated focus theory of power, we argue that in particular, organization members in lower (vs. higher) hierarchical positions who simultaneously experience a high (vs. low) sense of power respond with prosocial behavior to 1 important antecedent of prosocial motivation, that is, the enactment of procedural justice. The results from a multisource survey among employees and their leaders from various organizations (Study 1) and an experiment using a public goods dilemma (Study 2) support this prediction. Three subsequent experiments (Studies 3¨C5) show that this effect is mediated by perceptions of authority trustworthiness. Taken together, this research (a) helps resolve the debate regarding whether power promotes or undermines prosocial behavior, (b) demonstrates that hierarchical position and the sense of power can have very different effects on processes that are vital to the functioning of an organization, and (c) helps solve ambiguity regarding the roles of hierarchical position and power in fairness heuristic theory.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,10.1037/apl0000260,https://openalex.org/W2760710275,2018,Journal of Applied Psychology,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-biblio: 2018 Ranking low, feeling high: How hierarchical position and experienced power promote prosocial behavior in response ","Ranking low, feeling high: How hierarchical position and experienced power promote prosocial behavior in response to procedural justice.",10.1037/apl0000260,,Goal 5,0.010481613,FALSE,

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .",2016,The Role of Physical Formidability in Human Social Status Allocation,"Why are physically formidable men willingly allocated higher social status by others in cooperative groups? Ancestrally, physically formidable males would have been differentially equipped to generate benefits for groups by providing leadership services of within-group enforcement (e.g., implementing punishment of free riders) and between-group representation (e.g., negotiating with other coalitions). Therefore, we hypothesize that adaptations for social status allocation are designed to interpret men's physical formidability as a cue to these leadership abilities, and to allocate greater status to formidable men on this basis. These hypotheses were supported in 4 empirical studies wherein young adults rated standardized photos of subjects (targets) who were described as being part of a white-collar business consultancy. In Studies 1 and 2, male targets' physical strength positively predicted ratings of their projected status within the organization, and this effect was mediated by perceptions that stronger men possessed greater leadership abilities of within-group enforcement and between-group representation. Moreover, (a) these same patterns held whether status was conceptualized as overall ascendancy, prestige-based status, or dominance-based status, and (b) strong men who were perceived as aggressively self-interested were not allocated greater status. Finally, 2 experiments established the causality of physical formidability's effects on status-related perceptions by manipulating targets' relative strength (Study 3) and height (Study 4). In interpreting our findings, we argue that adaptations for formidability-based status allocation may have facilitated the evolution of group cooperation in humans and other primates.

The current research examines whether groups of leaders fail as often as they do in part because of the power each leader is accustomed to possessing among his or her constituents. In multiple studies we found that high power individuals, when working together in groups, performed worse than did other groups: individuals randomly assigned power in an initial task were less creative when they then worked together in groups on a subsequent task (Studies 1A and 4). Individuals with higher power who worked together in groups were also less likely to reach agreement on a difficult negotiation task, whether these groups comprised actual executives from an extant organization (Study 2) or participants randomly assigned power in the laboratory (Study 3). Mediation analyses suggest that groups of high power individuals performed worse because they fought over their relative status in the group, were less focused on the task, and shared information with each other less effectively. However, high power individuals were more effective when working on tasks that required less coordination: they were more creative (Studies 1B and 4) and persisted longer on a difficult task than other groups.

Here, using unbiased metabolomics and stable isotope-assisted tracing, we show that an inflammatory aspartate¨Cargininosuccinate shunt is induced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The shunt, supported by increased argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) expression, also leads to increased cytosolic fumarate levels and fumarate-mediated protein succination. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) further increases intracellular fumarate levels. Mitochondrial respiration is also suppressed and mitochondrial membrane potential increased. RNA sequencing and proteomics analyses demonstrate that there are strong inflammatory effects resulting from FH inhibition. Notably, acute FH inhibition suppresses interleukin-10 expression, which leads to increased tumour necrosis factor secretion, an effect recapitulated by fumarate esters. Moreover, FH inhibition, but not fumarate esters, increases interferon-¦Â production through mechanisms that are driven by mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) release and activation of the RNA sensors TLR7, RIG-I and MDA5. This effect is recapitulated endogenously when FH is suppressed following prolonged lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore, cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus also exhibit FH suppression, which indicates a potential pathogenic role for this process in human disease. We therefore identify a protective role for FH in maintaining appropriate macrophage cytokine and interferon responses. Inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase leads to deregulation of cytokine production in macrophages, which has implications in human diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.",SemanticScholar(DOI),100,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8eec6fbeb74b86db4340c370b4feb9234ea3f9a0,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Ana Cec¨ªlia Fieler, Ann E.

Previously, we described a probabilistic framework that quantified the strengths of evidence (supporting, moderate, strong, very strong) within ACMG/AMP recommendations. We have extended this framework to computational predictors and introduce a new standard that converts a tool's scores to PP3 and BP4 evidence strengths. Our approach is based on estimating the local positive predictive value and can calibrate any computational tool or other continuous-scale evidence on any variant type. We estimate thresholds (score intervals) corresponding to each strength of evidence for pathogenicity and benignity for thirteen missense variant interpretation tools, using carefully assembled independent data sets. Most tools achieved supporting evidence level for both pathogenic and benign classification using newly established thresholds. Multiple tools reached score thresholds justifying moderate and several reached strong evidence levels. One tool reached very strong evidence level for benign classification on some variants.

I argue that the monetary value that individuals who identify with their work seek for their work-output depends on their audience: when these individuals encounter discerning audiences, who are knowledgeable about and appreciative of their work, they under-emphasize financial gains; transactions with non-discerning audiences, however, result in a focus on monetary rewards. I further argue that the mechanism underlying this behavior is product attachment, where individuals who identify with their work develop affection for the output of their labor, thus preferring to transact with audiences who will take care of their products beyond the point of sale even if doing so results in lower payoffs. I substantiate this theory by demonstrating how handicraft artisans in India who identify with their work set prices for their products to different audiences.

Objective To determine the effect of multiple interventions for critically ill adults with COVID-19 on longer-term outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Prespecified secondary analysis of an ongoing adaptive platform trial (REMAP-CAP) testing interventions within multiple therapeutic domains in which 4869 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled between March 9, 2020, and June 22, 2021, from 197 sites in 14 countries. The final 180-day follow-up was completed on March 2, 2022. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive 1 or more interventions within 6 treatment domains: immune modulators (n = 2274), convalescent plasma (n = 2011), antiplatelet therapy (n = 1557), anticoagulation (n = 1033), antivirals (n = 726), and corticosteroids (n = 401). Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was survival through day 180, analyzed using a bayesian piecewise exponential model. A hazard ratio (HR) less than 1 represented improved survival (superiority), while an HR greater than 1 represented worsened survival (harm); futility was represented by a relative improvement less than 20% in outcome, shown by an HR greater than 0.83. Results Among 4869 randomized patients (mean age, 59.3 years; 1537 [32.1%] women), 4107 (84.3%) had known vital status and 2590 (63.1%) were alive at day 180. IL-6 receptor antagonists had a greater than 99.9% probability of improving 6-month survival (adjusted HR, 0.74 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.61-0.90]) and antiplatelet agents had a 95% probability of improving 6-month survival (adjusted HR, 0.85 [95% CrI, 0.71-1.03]) compared with the control, while the probability of trial-defined statistical futility (HR &amp;amp;gt;0.83) was high for therapeutic anticoagulation (99.9%; HR, 1.13 [95% CrI, 0.93-1.42]), convalescent plasma (99.2%; HR, 0.99 [95% CrI, 0.86-1.14]), and lopinavir-ritonavir (96.6%; HR, 1.06 [95% CrI, 0.82-1.38]) and the probabilities of harm from hydroxychloroquine (96.9%; HR, 1.51 [95% CrI, 0.98-2.29]) and the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (96.8%; HR, 1.61 [95% CrI, 0.97-2.67]) were high. The corticosteroid domain was stopped early prior to reaching a predefined statistical trigger; there was a 57.1% to 61.6% probability of improving 6-month survival across varying hydrocortisone dosing strategies. Conclusions and Relevance Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 randomized to receive 1 or more therapeutic interventions, treatment with an IL-6 receptor antagonist had a greater than 99.9% probability of improved 180-day mortality compared with patients randomized to the control, and treatment with an antiplatelet had a 95.0% probability of improved 180-day mortality compared with patients randomized to the control. Overall, when considered with previously reported short-term results, the findings indicate that initial in-hospital treatment effects were consistent for most therapies through 6 months.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W4311665916,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Ned Augenblick and Scott Nicholson.

We derive and empirically confirm the following prediction: Individuals with weaker incentives to conserve under the household's financial arrangements reduce water use more when their person-specific price increases. Another prediction is that this overconsumption problem is more acute when the financial benefit of a lower utility bill is shared unevenly among household members.

It leverages three needs we have observed in organizations as they use existing roadmapping processes: (1) to focus on development of customer and user experiences (UX), not just on features; (2) to increase engagement of designers early in the planning process; and (3) to provide a means for rapidly responding to changes in the environment. Design roadmapping is an attempt to reconcile differences that arise when customer/user needs are not considered simultaneously with technology choices. The proposed design roadmapping process assists project prioritization and selection. The process aggregates design experience elements along a timeline that associates key user needs with the products, services, and/or systems the organization wishes to deliver. To illustrate the design roadmapping process, we conducted a case study in which we applied the design roadmapping process to projects undertaken by a large corporation's innovation lab located in research centers in San Francisco and Mountain View, CA, in partnership with corporate stakeholders located in Asia. The five-step design roadmapping procedure is provided along with detailed information. The decisions from the design roadmapping process have been incorporated into the company's commercial plans. Key findings in this corporate case study bolster the positive impact of design roadmapping in moving strategic thinking from a technology/feature-driven process to one that is design/experience-driven.

Winter/Spring, 53(1): 60-62.",2021,"Behavioral norms, not personality, is how cultures change","This work analyzes the concepts of intercultural communication, communication, cultural stress, speech etiquette. The problem of how to form personality skills, through which intercultural communication develops, is considered, which is a means of understanding the characteristics of different cultures, which are a condition for effective dialogue between people in the modern world. The great role of speech etiquette in the process of intercultural communication is proved. The characteristics of intercultural misunderstandings in the process of communication are considered. Successful acculturation is considered an important task of teaching higher mathematics and physics. So, on the one hand, the model of cultural stress feels the processes and intercultural encounters well. On the other hand, this view contains a hidden temptation to unfairly bifurcate cultural differences that relate to the mixture of a multilingual society and its transculturality. Different cultures have their own traditions and norms of communication. Ignorance of this issue causes many misunderstandings, which can lead to a mismatch of cultures, the emergence and development of a condition, considered cultural stress. Therefore, it is very important to know the norms and traditions of communication of representatives of the people who are participants in a language dialogue, belonging to different national cultures. It is necessary to perceive each other calmly, politely, with respect and understanding, that is, to positively contribute to the development of dialogue and intercultural communication. Which, in turn, contributes to the formation of intercultural communicative behavior. Education today has undergone significant changes from its purpose to the method of teaching. All this has greatly improved the educational process. This is important, because modern education belongs to the highest values ??of people and the development of society, and the deeper and higher the educational level of a person, the greater and wider his/her opportunities for creating a better and more interesting life.

We draw on the perceived diversity literature, hypothesizing that collectivistic norms cause group members to blur demographic differences, resulting in perceptions that group members are more similar than they actually are. Whether this benefits or harms group performance depends on the group¡¯s objective diversity and the relevance of the perceived diversity attribute for accomplishing the task. For conjunctive tasks, the group¡¯s performance is determined by its weakest member, demanding high levels of cohesion. Our theory suggests that collectivism benefits group conjunctive performance when objective national diversity is high by blurring divisive relational differences but has no effect in groups with low objective national diversity. In contrast, for disjunctive tasks, the group¡¯s performance is determined by its best member. We predict that collectivism harms group disjunctive performance when objective expertness diversity is high by blurring differences in task-relevant expertness but has no effect in low objective expertness diversity groups. We find support for our theory in two studies, an archival study of 5,214 Himalayan climbing expeditions and a laboratory experiment assessing 366 groups.

Economic models suggest that free-riding incentives and lower opportunity costs give the less competent a comparative advantage at entering political life. Moreover, if elites have more human capital, selecting on competence may lead to uneven representation. This article examines patterns of political selection among the universe of municipal politicians and national legislators in Sweden, using extraordinarily rich data on competence traits and social background for the entire population. We document four new facts that together characterize an ¡°inclusive meritocracy.¡± First, politicians are on average significantly smarter and better leaders than the population they represent. Second, this positive selection is present even when conditioning on family (and hence social) background, suggesting that individual competence is key for selection. Third, the representation of social background, whether measured by parental earnings or occupational social class, is remarkably even. Fourth, there is at best a weak trade-off in selection between competence and social representation, mainly due to strong positive selection of politicians of low (parental) socioeconomic status.

Surveys show that politicians and voters of the Sweden Democrats share strong anti-establishment and anti-immigration attitudes that drastically set them apart from Sweden¡¯s other parties. Searching for individual traits that link naturally to these attitudes, we classify the universe of Swedish politicians and voters by social and economic marginalization and exposure to immigration. Politicians from the Sweden Democrats over-represent marginalized groups without strong attachments to the labour market or to traditional nuclear families, which instead are under-represented among politicians in all other parties. Among voters, the Sweden Democrats have higher electoral support in precincts with higher shares of the same marginalized groups. We see the mobilization of the marginalized as an important driver of the party¡¯s success. Finally, we uncover that Sweden-Democrat politicians score lower on a number of valence traits than other-party politicians.

Method In Study 1, affective states and personality traits of 29 targets were rated by 124 judges whose individual accuracy was scored as the correlation between their ratings and target criterion scores (across targets). In Study 2, a comparable analysis was done using 30 different targets and 330 different judges. Results Accuracy in judging distressed affect was significantly positively correlated with accuracy in judging Neuroticism in both studies, as well as in a meta©\analysis across the two studies. Accuracy in judging positive affect was significantly positively correlated with accuracy in judging Extraversion in one of the two studies, with the meta©\analysis across the two studies being significant. Conclusions These findings provide preliminary evidence for a new model (State and Trait Accuracy Model) that outlines when concordance in accuracy across traits and states should be expected.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2414275580,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Hall  , Gunnery, S",,,,Goal 13,0.008230484,FALSE,

Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology . 2017",2017,"Cesario, J","Concerns have been raised recently about the replicability of behavioral priming effects, and calls have been issued to identify priming methodologies with effects that can be obtained in any context and with any population. I argue that such expectations are misguided and inconsistent with evolutionary understandings of the brain as a computational organ. Rather, we should expect priming effects to be highly sensitive to variations in experimental features and subject populations. Such variation does not make priming effects frivolous or capricious but instead can be predicted a priori. However, absent theories specifying the precise contingencies that lead to such variation, failures to replicate another researcher¡¯s findings will necessarily be ambiguous with respect to the inferences that can be made. Priming research is not yet at the stage where such theories exist, and therefore failures are uninformative at the current time. Ultimately, priming researchers themselves must provide direct replications of their own effects; researchers have been deficient in meeting this responsibility and have contributed to the current state of confusion. The recommendations issued in this article reflect concerns both with the practice of priming researchers and with the inappropriate expectations of researchers who have failed to replicate others¡¯ priming effects.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2012428153,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Cesario, J., Jonas, K., & Carney, D.

We tested this overarching hypothesis in a longitudinal field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group that self-generated positive emotions via loving-kindness meditation or to a waiting-list control group. Participants in the intervention group increased in positive emotions relative to those in the control group, an effect moderated by baseline vagal tone, a proxy index of physical health. Increased positive emotions, in turn, produced increases in vagal tone, an effect mediated by increased perceptions of social connections.

This is the story of one education scientist¡¯s serendipitous experience beginning a career in medical simulation. I can recall the look in your eyes when we first began, the confusion and uncertainty of what we could accomplish together. Though you had inimitable passion in your role as teacher and clinician, you had no plans to make scholarship your mission. You¡¯d say, ¡°I know simulation is the best!¡± To which I¡¯d simply reply, ¡°Then let¡¯s make proving it our quest!¡± Our journey together started slowly. From you, I learned about resuscitation algorithms, the importance of chest compression depth, and the steps of placing a central line. From me, you came to understand the importance of theoretical foundations, objective measurement, and assessing skills at baseline. A lot of observing turned into a tweak here and a tweak there, with me always asking, ¡°Why do we do it this way?¡± ¡°How do we know they learned?¡± and ¡°Can we make two groups to compare?¡± So together we worked, revising curricula to ensure best practices, telling our confederate actors to ¡°Stick to the script!¡± and not letting ¡°sim-haters¡± distract us. We developed our rhythm, collaborating on each new idea before we proceeded and nervously analyzing the data to see if we succeeded. That first publication came after many rejections and rounds of review. But I wouldn¡¯t have wanted it any other way, if I had to choose. We worked so hard for our names to be in print together for the first time. Now duos like us are common in simulation centers far and wide, where physicians and education scientists work together side-by-side. The research flows and the evidence base grows. You and I have both moved on, no longer working together. We¡¯ve gone our separate ways, each climbing our own ladder. But the skills we learned from each other we still use every day. I am a soldier of preparation, rehearsal, and planning for the worst. You seize all opportunities for continued learning, never quenching your own thirst.

As part of the project ¡°Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life¡± (AFTOL), results of four Bayesian analyses are reported with complementary bootstrap assessment of phylogenetic confidence based on (1) a combined two©\locus data set (nucSSU and nucLSU rDNA) with 558 species representing all traditionally recognized fungal phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota) and the Glomeromycota, (2) a combined three©\locus data set (nucSSU, nucLSU, and mitSSU rDNA) with 236 species, (3) a combined three©\locus data set (nucSSU, nucLSU rDNA, and RPB2 ) with 157 species, and (4) a combined four©\locus data set (nucSSU, nucLSU, mitSSU rDNA, and RPB2 ) with 103 species. Because of the lack of complementarity among single©\locus data sets, the last three analyses included only members of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The four©\locus analysis resolved multiple deep relationships within the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota that were not revealed previously or that received only weak support in previous studies.

Unexpectedly, at the peak of the response, 94% of CAR T cells originated from a single clone in which lentiviral vector-mediated insertion of the CAR transgene disrupted the methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 gene. Further analysis revealed a hypomorphic mutation in this patient&#8217;s second TET2 allele. TET2-disrupted CAR T cells exhibited an epigenetic profile consistent with altered T cell differentiation and, at the peak of expansion, displayed a central memory phenotype. Experimental knockdown of TET2 recapitulated the potency-enhancing effect of TET2 dysfunction in this patient&#8217;s CAR T cells. These findings suggest that the progeny of a single CAR T cell induced leukaemia remission and that TET2 modification may be useful for improving immunotherapies. Genetically engineered T cells that induced remission in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were found to have disruption of the TET2 gene, which caused T cell changes that potentiated their anti-tumour effects.",LandingPage(meta/jsonld),100,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0178-z,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:David Levine, Martha A.

 Supervision of multinational banks (MNBs) by national supervisors suffers from coordination failures. We show that supranational supervision solves this problem and decreases the public costs of an MNB¡¯s failure, taking its organizational structure as given. However, the MNB strategically adjusts its structure to supranational supervision. It converts its subsidiary into a branch (or vice versa) to reduce supervisory monitoring. We identify the cases in which this endogenous reaction leads to unintended consequences, such as higher public costs and lower welfare. Current reforms should consider that MNBs adapt their organizational structures to changes in supervision.

Review of Economic Studies . 2017,2017,Stefano DellaVigna and Johannes Hermle,"Media outlets are increasingly owned by conglomerates, inducing a conflict of interest: a media outlet can bias its coverage to benefit companies in the same group. We test for bias by examining movie reviews in media outlets owned by News Corp, such as the Wall Street Journal, and Time Warner, such as Time. We find higher ratings for 20th Century Fox movies in News Corp. outlets compared to movies by other studios. To disentangle bias from correlation of taste, we introduce and validate a novel matching procedure using individual movie ratings from online platforms. Using this procedure, we find no evidence of bias in News Corp. nor Time Warner outlets. We reject even small effects, such as bias of one extra star (out of four) every thirteen movies. We test for differential bias when the return to bias is plausibly higher, examine bias by media outlet and by journalist, as well as editorial bias. We also consider bias by omission¡ªwhether media outlets are more likely to review highly-rated movies by affiliated studios¡ªand conflict of interest within a movie aggregator. In none of these dimensions do we find evidence of bias.

We find that workers have substantial baseline social preferences towards their employers, even in the absence of repeated-game incentives. Consistent with models of warm glow or social norms, but not of pure altruism, workers exert substantially more effort when their work is consequential to their employer, but are insensitive to the precise return to the employer. Turning to reciprocity, we find little evidence of a response to unexpected positive (or negative) gifts from the employer. Our structural estimates of the social preferences suggest that, if anything, positive reciprocity in response to monetary `gifts' may be larger than negative reciprocity.

November 2023",2023,"Omri Even-Tov, Kanyuan Huang, Brett Trueman, and Noah Goldstein","When two people coincidentally have something in common (such as a name or birthday), they tend to like each other more and are thus more likely to offer help and comply with requests. This dynamic can have important legal and ethical consequences whenever these incidental similarities give rise to unfair favoritism. Using a large-scale, longitudinal natural experiment, covering nearly 200,000 annual earnings forecasts over more than 25 y, we show that when a CEO and a securities analyst share a first name, the analyst¡¯s financial forecast is more accurate. We offer evidence that name matching improves forecast accuracy due to CEOs privately sharing pertinent information with name-matched analysts. Additionally, we show that this effect is especially pronounced among CEO?analyst pairs who share an uncommon first name. Our research thus demonstrates how incidental similarities can give way to special treatment. Whereas most investigations of the effects of similarity consider only one-shot interactions, we use a longitudinal dataset to show that the effect of name matching diminishes over time with more interactions between CEOs and analysts. We also point to the findings of an experiment suggesting that favoritism born of sharing a name may evade straightforward regulation in part due to people¡¯s perception that name similarity would exert little influence on them.

Review of Accounting Studies (forthcoming) . 2020,2020,Omri Even-Tov and N,"While the intended goal of the 2012 JOBS Act was to ease access to capital for Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs), prior studies, notably Barth et al. (2017), find evidence of an increase in IPO underpricing and a higher cost of equity capital for EGC issuers. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that changes in overall IPO market conditions explain the seeming increase in IPO underpricing. In fact, EGC issuers that take advantage of the accounting disclosure relief afforded by the Act raise capital at higher pre-IPO multiples. These reduced-accounting disclosure EGCs have more speculative valuation profiles and lower institutional ownership and are more likely to destroy long-term shareholder value in the IPO aftermarket. Overall, our paper offers an alternative perspective on the effect of the JOBS Act on IPO pricing.",SemanticScholar(search),100,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a9953c75cdcf3e3f7f98656290f21527a542ee7c,,,likely_no_public_abstract,CR-biblio:Omri Even-Tov and N.

Journal of Accounting and Economics . 2017,2017,Omri Even-Tov,"ABSTRACT We examine the impact of reducing information processing costs on U.S. state regulators who supervise mortgage companies. State regulators traditionally disclosed enforcement actions only on their individual websites. A centralized repository, introduced in 2012, assembled enforcement records across states in one place, reducing a regulator¡¯s cost to learn about enforcements in other states. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that enforcement records posted on the centralized repository significantly increase the probability of subsequent enforcement actions against the same firm in other states. This suggests that reducing information processing costs helps state regulators identify companies engaging in misconduct. This effect is stronger for records from state websites where information is harder to process and for state regulators with more limited resources. Last, we observe that sanctioned lenders reduce the credit supply in other states after their enforcement records in one state are posted on the centralized repository.

Journal of Consumer Research . 2017,2017,Evers and Michael O¡¯Donnell,"Abstract A fundamental contribution of consumer behavior research is to help marketing scholars develop an understanding of how people think about and express their preferences. In this article we find that two commonly used preference elicitation procedures, willingness to pay (WTP) and choice, are consistently associated with different expressed preferences. Specifically, choices are associated with a relatively greater preference for hedonic goods, while WTP is associated with a relatively greater preference for utilitarian goods. We find that this is caused, in part, by the greater reliance on deliberation in determining WTP values, while preferences in choices are determined by an affect heuristic. Unlike other choice and WTP preference reversals, we find that this effect is not caused by mechanical determinants such as scale compatibility, as the effect persists with continuous scale measures that rely on affect and with choice-based scale measures that rely on determining valuation.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2610836098,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:Ellen R.K.

Here, we report seven sets of studies demonstrating strong framing effects on the acceptance of equivalent policies. Policies targeting desirable voluntary behavior are preferred when they are framed as advantaging those who act desirably (rather than disadvantaging those who do not). Conversely, policies targeting obligations are preferred when they are framed as disadvantaging those who fail to act desirably (rather than advantaging those who do). These differences in policy acceptance do not result from common causes of framing effects, such as a misunderstanding of outcomes or insufficient deliberation about the implications. Rather, the framing effects we document follow from beliefs about when punishment is and is not appropriate.

We aim to parameterize a modified version of the FHN model that re-produces the dynamics in space of more complex cardiac cell models. We combined a series of modifications that previously were applied to the FHN model - mainly, the addition of a nullcline at zero voltage for the fast variable, that eliminates the hyperpolarization of the traditional FHN model and the modification of the slow nullcline from linear to quadratic, which allows alternans behavior and a better fit to experiments and other models. This new model is fitted using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to fit the action potential for a large number of pacing periods so that the restitution of the action potential is matched between the two models. We created a modified FHN model that matches most of the action potential (AP) shape of the TNNP model for a large range of periods and dynamics in space.

Journal of Marketing Research . 2021 (forthcoming),2021,Ganesh Iyer and Hema Yoganarasimhan,"The authors study the phenomenon of strategic group polarization, in which members take more extreme actions than their preferences. The analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams, corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group¡¯s realized outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate. Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game lowers polarization when agents¡¯ preferences are relatively similar. Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is also welfare enhancing.

Fischer, 1814, occurs in South America and presents an extensive degree of morphological and genetic variability. Previous phylogenetic research showed that the genus Mazama is polyphyletic and imposed the designation of a different genus-group name for M. gouazoubira. We aimed to review and clarify the taxonomy of M. gouazoubira through the proposal of updating the nomenclature for this taxon and by the characterization of specimens collected close to the original type locality (topotypes). The topotypes were characterized by morphological (general characterization and morphometry), cytogenetic (conventional staining, Ag-NOR, G- and C-banding, and fluorescence in situ hybridization), and phylogenetic (mitogenomes) approaches. We revealed chromosome homologies between cattle and M. gouazoubira using an entire set of cattle whole chromosome painting probes and propose an updated G-band idiogram for the species. The morphometric analysis did not discriminate the individuals of M. gouazoubira, including the topotypes, from other small brocket deer species. However, the phylogenetic analysis, based on a Bayesian inference tree of the mitogenomes, confirmed the polyphyly of the genus Mazama and supported the need to change the gray brocket deer genus-group name. Based on our revision, we validated the genus SubuloSmith, 1827, and fixed a type species for the genus.

Frailty is a nonspecific state of vulnerability, which reflects multisystem physiological change. These changes underlying frailty do not always achieve disease status, so some people, usually very elderly, are frail without a specific life threatening illness. Current thinking is that not only physical but also psychological, cognitive and social factors contribute to this syndrome and need to be taken into account in its definition and treatment. Together, these signs and symptoms seem to reflect a reduced functional reserve and consequent decrease in adaptation (resilience) to any sort of stressor and perhaps even in the absence of extrinsic stressors. The overall consequence is that frail elderly are at higher risk for accelerated physical and cognitive decline, disability and death. All these characteristics associated with frailty can easily be applied to the definition and characterization of the aging process per se and there is little consensus in the literature concerning the physiological/biological pathways associated with or determining frailty. It is probably true to say that a consensus view would implicate heightened chronic systemic inflammation as a major contributor to frailty.

For educational leaders, gender- and sexuality-related equity involves the recognition that schools often represent hostile, discriminatory, and inequitable learning environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer plus (LGBTQ+) individuals; however, this is merely the first step. Establishing equitable learning environments for LGBTQ+ individuals requires action and, especially in this instance, the courage to take effective action toward purging the school culture of all institutionalized barriers and negative beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors regarding LGBTQ+ people. School leaders dedicated to ensuring that all students genuinely have an equal opportunity to succeed will extend that obligation to the many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and questioning individuals, plus those who do not otherwise identify as heterosexual and/or gender compliant (LGBTQ+) and those who are merely perceived to be, as well as their family, friends, and allies, who are also all a vital and deserving part of the school community. Achieving gender- and sexuality-related equity involves the creation of LGBTQ+-inclusive curricula, decentering hetero/cisnormativity, eliminating homophobic and transphobic harassment and bullying, identifying and eliminating policies and procedures that discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals, and ensuring that all school personnel have the necessary knowledge and understanding of LGBTQ+ realities to become caring and supportive allies.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W3129697933,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:Smith 2020 Mitigating bias in artificial intelligence: An equity fluent leadership playbook,,,,Goal 4,0.060951579,TRUE,gender parity in education

Case overview/synopsis Neha Arora demonstrated exceptional capabilities of defying the social stigma associated with People with Disabilities (PwDs) to establish Planet Abled, a first in the world venture to provide accessible leisure excursions to PwDs. This entrepreneurial initiative enabling group and solo travel for PwDs as inclusive tourism has created the possibility of social sustainability by bringing change in the lives of PwDs and their family members by ignoring either the insensitive or overprotective societal attitudes and lack of infrastructure concerning travel for PwDs. Its potential growth qualifies for scaling-up, but it can also attract the existing big travel solution providers to enter this domain. Considering these facts, Neha faces multiple dilemmas: How can she sustain and scale up the early momentum created by her enterprise? How can she resolve the challenges related to the paradox of the social mission and the financial/ economic logic while scaling-up Planet Abled?

We develop a simple model of firm cost-minimization, where firms¡¯ borrowing capacity to smooth temporary shocks to liquidity is limited. In this framework, firm exit arises from the interaction between this financial friction and fluctuations in cash flow due to aggregate and sectoral changes in demand conditions, as well as more traditional shocks to productivity. To evaluate the implications of our model, we use firm level data on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in 11 European countries. We confirm that our framework is consistent with official failure rates in 2017¨C2019, a period characterized by standard business cycle fluctuations. To capture a large liquidity shock, we apply our framework to the COVID-19 crisis. We find that, absent government support, SME failure rates would have increased by 6.01 percentage points, putting 3.1% of employment at risk. Our results also show that in the presence of financial frictions and in the absence of government support, the firms failing due to COVID have similar productivity and growth to firms that survive COVID.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W4400221193,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas and Nicolas Coeurdacier..

This gas is mainly used in the chemical industry and in the oil refining industry, but the constant growth of its applications has generated the interest of all the countries of the world.

The strategic implementation of antioxidant additives provides a potential solution to alleviate this issue. This work presents results from the second phase of the global consortium for antioxidants research aimed at investigating the effectiveness of potential antioxidants in increasing the durability of asphalt binders. Sixteen laboratories around the world participated in this effort and a total of 28 binders from diverse geographical regions were tested. Two promising antioxidants, namely zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (ZDC) and kraft lignin were evaluated in this phase and blended with the binders at specific proportions. Subsequently, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to assess rheological characteristics and chemical properties of the various blends, utilising Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) measurements and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. The findings indicate that additives such as ZDC hold considerable promise as an effective antioxidant, particularly when considering a wide diversity of binders. In general, its incorporation does not compromise the rutting performance of the binders and significantly improves fatigue performance.

Across a wide range of civil services entry is competitive, promotion is constrained by seniority, jobs are for life, and retirement occurs at a fixed age. This implies that older entering officers, who are less likely to attain the glittering prize of reaching the top of the bureaucracy before they retire, may be less motivated to exert effort. Using a nationwide stakeholder survey and rich administrative data on elite civil servants in India, we provide evidence that: (i) officers who cannot reach the senior-most positions before they retire are perceived to be less effective and are more likely to be suspended and (ii) this effect is weakened by a reform that extends the retirement age. Together, these results suggest that the career incentive of reaching the top of a public organization is a powerful determinant of bureaucrat performance.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2945117982,,,likely_no_public_abstract,"CR-biblio:Guo Xu, Marianne Bertrand, Robin Burgess, and Arunish Chawla.

But by mid-century, their monopoly had given way to a raucous free market for medical care. To explain the causes and consequences of this dismantling of a professional monopoly, we draw on political sociology. We argue that to maintain a monopoly, a dominant profession must defend its cultural authority against rival claims and preserve its institutional support from the state. A dominant profession can lose its monopoly if rival occupations mobilize to challenge its cultural authority and if populist political coalitions mobilize to repeal laws upholding professional monopolies. Our analysis, which covers all states in the Union by 1860, reveals that the dynamics of contention, both within the system of professions and in the wider political arena, can erode the foundations of professional monopolies.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2913753545,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Habinek  Habinek, Jacob, and Heather A",,,,Goal 17,0.012835576,FALSE,

The thing is I had been told the story by a young person of my acquaintance, now long since dead, and had found it so extremely good that I rushed home, pulled up my typewriter and pounded it out, about six or eight pages. I didn't think I had remembered the names but read the thing over and shoved it in my desk drawer where it remained for several months. Then one day the magazine [the New Masses] wrote asking for something. I picked up the story, put it in a large manila envelope, and mailed it to them. I received no reply, and being used to refusals and all that, I half-forgot the incident, thinking that when they sent me the galleys I'd go over it changing anything that might seem necessary. Then one day I received the magazine with my story in it, already printed and being distributed. I almost dropped dead for I realized at once what I was in for. A prominent member of the bar, whose name I have since detested, was supposed to look over all material accepted by the magazine for possibly libelous matter. He had not even looked at it, but did a beautiful fade away, wealthy as I knew him to be. The editorial gang had nothing, so I was left holding the bag. And the trouble was that because of the nature of the material my misdemeanor turned out to be a tort. Though everything about the tale was originally related to me as factually true, later my pal, the person who had given me the details so beautifully, signed a statement against me.

We then describe changes in Chinese society and economy over the past four decades, as it shifted from state-controlled planning and redistribution to market-mediated exchange. We detail how the institutional logics that guide Chinese firms have been transformed in the wake of the economic transition. The state logic, which developed in the Maoist era, valorizes equality, national community, and political stability. Although it is still in evidence, it has been partly supplanted by a market logic that encourages efficiency, competition, and property rights. But this market logic differs from the one that prevails in Western capitalist economies. The Chinese version of the market logic valorizes the central role that the state and the Communist Party continue to play in economic life. Therefore, in the Chinese version of the market logic, efficiency, competition, and property rights are tempered by a continued concern for political stability.

We repeat some of the survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition to execution.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 2018",2018,"Jenkins, Adrianna, Pierre Karashchuk, Lusha Zhu, & Ming Hsu","Disparities in outcomes across social groups pervade human societies and are of central interest to the social sciences. How people treat others is known to depend on a multitude of factors (e.g., others¡¯ gender, ethnicity, appearance) even when these should be irrelevant. However, despite substantial progress, much remains unknown regarding ( i ) the set of mechanisms shaping people¡¯s behavior toward members of different social groups and ( ii ) the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the structure of existing societal disparities. Here, we show in a set of experiments the important interplay between social perception and social valuation processes in explaining how people treat members of different social groups. Building on the idea that stereotypes can be organized onto basic, underlying dimensions, we first found using laboratory economic games that quantitative variation in stereotypes about different groups¡¯ warmth and competence translated meaningfully into resource allocation behavior toward those groups. Computational modeling further revealed that these effects operated via the interaction of social perception and social valuation processes, with warmth and competence exerting diverging effects on participants¡¯ preferences for equitable distributions of resources. This framework successfully predicted behavior toward members of a diverse set of social groups across samples and successfully generalized to predict societal disparities documented in labor and education settings with substantial precision and accuracy. Together, these results highlight a common set of mechanisms linking social group information to social treatment and show how preexisting, societally shared assumptions about different social groups can produce and reinforce societal disparities.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2891300107,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Jenkins  Jenkins, Adrianna, Pierre Karashchuk, Lusha Zhu, & Ming Hsu",,10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.09.005,,Goal 1,0.095433117,TRUE,social cohesion

This is because many biological, environmental, and anthropogenic factors interact to determine the distribution of invasive species. However, in this paper we also argue that many analyses of invasiveness have been flawed by not considering several fundamental issues: (1) the range size of an invasive species depends on how much time it has had to spread (its residence time); (2) the range size and spread rate are mediated by the total extent of suitable (i.e. potentially invasible) habitat; and (3) the range size and spread rate depend on the frequency and intensity of introductions (propagule pressure), the position of founder populations in relation to the potential range, and the spatial distribution of the potential range. We explored these considerations using a large set of invasive alien plant species in South Africa for which accurate distribution data and other relevant information were available. Species introduced earlier and those with larger potential ranges had larger current range sizes, but we found no significant effect of the spatial distribution of potential ranges on current range sizes, and data on propagule pressure were largely unavailable. However, crucially, we showed that: (1) including residence time and potential range always significantly increases the explanatory power of the models; and (2) residence time and potential range can affect which factors emerge as significant determinants of invasiveness. Therefore, analyses not including potential range and residence time can come to misleading conclusions. When these factors were taken into account, we found that nitrogen©\fixing plants and plants invading arid regions have spread faster than other species, but these results were phylogenetically constrained. We also show that, when analysed in the context of residence time and potential range, variation in range size among invasive species is implicitly due to variation in spread rates, and, that by explicitly assuming a particular model of spread, it is possible to estimate changes in the rates of plant invasions through time. We believe that invasion biology can develop generalizations that are useful for management, but only in the context of a suitable null model.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2129850518,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:  Flawed Analyses of U,,,,Goal 15,0.06960397,TRUE,invasive species

Root biomass, C-OM, C-MAOM and C-POM were measured in a Petrocalcic Argiudol at five soil depths up to 100&amp;nbsp;cm during two years in the south-eastern Pampas of Argentina. The field experiment comprised 28 plots including five perennial pastures and two annual crop sequences. Associations between variables were assessed by regression analysis and non-linear models. Overall, ACS and PP had similar cumulative root biomass. Both, root biomass and soil C stocks exponentially decreased with soil depth. Soil C stocks associated to root biomass tended to stabilize over a threshold value of root biomass for C-MAOM and C-OM.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 2019,2019,van Dorp et al,"Abstract Introduction: Brexu-cel is an autologous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy approved for adults with R/R MCL and R/R B-ALL. BL is a rare, highly aggressive B-cell malignancy characterized by translocation of the MYC oncogene. Pts with R/R BL have limited treatment options and outcomes are poor with a median overall survival (OS) of 2.8 mo after salvage therapy (Short NJ, et al. Am J Hematol. 2017). ZUMA-25 (NCT05537766) is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter basket study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of brexu-cel in adults with rare B-cell malignancies. Here, we report the preliminary efficacy and safety of brexu-cel in pts with R/R BL in ZUMA-25 (Substudy C). Methods: Eligible pts were aged ¡Ý18 y, had an ECOG performance status 0-1, histologically confirmed mature B-cell NHL Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and R/R disease after ¡Ý1 prior line of chemoimmunotherapy. Pts underwent leukapheresis, optional bridging therapy, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and infusion of brexu-cel (2¡Á106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg; dose was validated in a run-in phase with 3 pts before enrolling additional pts). Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) by investigator assessment per the Lugano classification (Cheson BD, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2014). Key secondary endpoints were CR rate, duration of response (DOR), OS, progression-free survival (PFS), time to first response, time to best response, safety, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) per EQ-5D-5L index. Exploratory analyses included CAR T-cell levels. Outcomes were analyzed descriptively without hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint due to early termination of the trial given low pt enrollment. Results: Twelve pts were enrolled and underwent leukapheresis, of whom 10 (83%) received brexu-cel (2 pts did not receive brexu-cel due to death from progressive disease [PD; n=1] and withdrawal from study [n=1]). There were no manufacturing failures; median vein-to-vein time (range) was 25.5 d (23-28; n=4) and 37.0 (28-51; n=6) for pts in the US and EU, respectively. As of Dec 17, 2024, median follow-up in treated pts (N=10) was 5.6 mo (range, 3.8-24.2). Median age was 50.5 y (range, 36-70), 50% were male, 30% were Hispanic/Latino. At baseline, 8 pts (80%) had an ECOG performance status of 1; 5 pts each (50%) had refractory and early relapse BL (&amp;lt;6 mo from first remission); median number of prior therapies was 1.5 (range, 1-6) and included chemotherapy and/or rituximab; 1 pt received prior autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Eight pts had bridging therapy, including radiotherapy (n=3) and/or chemotherapy (n=6). Among treated pts (N=10), ORR was 100% (95% CI, 69-100; CR rate, 50%; PR rate, 50%). Median time from infusion to first/best response was 29 d (range, 25-284), with 1 pt converting from stable disease to CR at Mo 9; no pt with PR converted to CR. Median (95% CI) DOR, PFS, and OS were 5.0 mo (2.2-not estimable [NE]), 5.8 mo (3.1-NE), and 12.9 mo (3.8-NE), respectively. Among pts with CR, the 6-mo (95% CI) DOR, PFS, and OS rates were 75% (13-96), 75% (13-96), and 100% (100-100), respectively. DOR for each of the 5 pts with CR was 4.83+, 4.96, 10.18+, 11.33+, and 14.88+ mo (+ indicates censoring); at data cutoff, 4 pts were still alive and in ongoing response without subsequent therapy and 1 pt died due to PD after subsequent therapy and SCT. Among the 5 pts with PR as best response, DOR ranged from 0.03-4.24 mo; at data cutoff, 2 pts were still alive with PD, and 3 pts died (2 due to PD [1 with subsequent SCT] and 1 due to an adverse event [AE; pneumonia, deemed unrelated to brexu-cel] with subsequent SCT). AEs occurred in all pts; 9 (90%) had Grade ¡Ý3 AEs. The most common AEs were pyrexia (100%) and decreased neutrophil count (50%). All pts had any-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS); 1 (10%) had Grade 3 CRS. Neurologic events occurred in 8 pts (80%); 6 (60%) had Grade 3. Median peak, area under the curve, and time to peak CAR T-cell levels were 41.9 cells/¦ÌL, 450.1 cells/¦ÌL ¡Á days, and 8 d (range, 8-57), respectively. Most evaluable pts (6/7) had stable or improved quality of life 3 months after screening. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of a commercial CAR T-cell therapy in pts with R/R BL. Preliminary efficacy, safety, and PROs are promising in this difficult-to-treat pt population; this analysis is limited by its small sample size and short follow-up.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W4417008403,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:van Dorp et al..

Econometrica . 2017",2017,"Lowes S, Nunn N, Robinson JA, and Weigel JL","SUMMARY Background We evaluated the use of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital because of COVID-19. Methods This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was conducted that included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04381936 ). Findings Between 2 February 2021 and 29 December 2021, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 hours recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 513 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0¡¤87; 95% CI 0¡¤77-0¡¤98; p=0¡¤026). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of 8 previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths) in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.45-0.72). Including the results from RECOVERY into an updated meta-analysis of all 9 completed trials (involving 11,888 randomised patients and 1484 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.71-0.89; p&lt;0.001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes. Interpretation In patients hospitalised for COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth.

Management Science . 2016,2016,Ganesh Iyer and Zsolt Katona,"We investigate the incentives for social communication in the new social media technologies. Three features of online social communication are represented in the model. First, new social media platforms allow for increased connectivity; i.e., they enable sending messages to many more receivers, for the same fixed cost, compared to traditional word of mouth. Second, users contribute content because they derive status- or image-based utility from being listened to by their peers. Third, we capture the role of social differentiation, or how social distance between people affects their preferences for messages. In the model, agents endogenously decide whether to be a sender of information and then compete for the attention of receivers. An important point of this paper is that social communication incentives diminish even as the reach or the span of communication increases. As the span of communication increases, competition between senders for receiver attention becomes more intense, resulting in senders competing with greater equilibrium messaging effort. This in turn leads to lower equilibrium payoffs and the entry of fewer senders. This result provides a strategic rationale for the so-called participation inequality phenomenon, which is a characteristic of many social media platforms. We also show that social differentiation may enhance or deter sender entry depending on whether it can be endogenously influenced by senders. Finally, we examine how the underlying network structure (in terms of its density and its degree distribution) affects communication and uncover a nonmonotonic pattern in that increased connectivity first increases and then reduces the entry of senders.

 We document the transmission of large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve to the real economy using rich borrower-linked mortgage-market data and an identification strategy based on mortgage market segmentation. We find that central bank QE1 MBS purchases substantially increased refinancing activity, reduced interest payments for refinancing households, led to a boom in equity extraction, and increased aggregate consumption. Relative to QE-ineligible jumbo mortgages, QE-eligible conforming mortgage interest rates fell by an additional 40 bp and refinancing volumes increased by an additional 56% during QE1. We estimate that households refinancing during QE1 increased their durable consumption by 12%. Our results highlight that the transmission of unconventional monetary policy to the real economy depends crucially on the composition of assets purchased and the degree of segmentation in the market.",SemanticScholar(DOI),100,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e26126100443769637a6d3b47ecebb8e823de926,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Marco Di Maggio, Amir Kermani, and Christopher Palmer.

We then re-analyze meta-analytic data on self-reported initiation of salary negotiations to reconcile our findings with prior work (Study 2C). While men reported higher negotiation propensity than women prior to the twenty-first century, the gender difference grew neutral and then reversed since then. Negotiation propensity rose across time for both men and women, although to differing degrees. Finally, we explore the consequences of the now-outdated belief that ""women don't ask,"" finding that it increases gender stereotyping, even on dimensions unrelated to negotiation, and it is associated with both greater system-justification and weaker support for legislation addressing pay equity (Studies 3 and 4).

Harvard Business Review (digital article) (January 19, 2023)",2023,", Jin, C","TPS8658 Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are the most common driver mutations in NSCLC. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the recommended front-line option for EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients, but patients invariably develop acquired resistance and face disease progression. JIN-A02, a 4 th generation EGFR-TKI intended for oral administration, selectively and reversibly binds to EGFR mutations, including the C797S and/or T790M mutation that causes resistance to 3rd generation of EGFR-TKIs. Pre-clinical studies with EGFR C797S and/or T790M mutated cell lines showed that JIN-A02 can inhibit cell growth in a dose dependent manner and has a high degree of selectivity over wild-type EGFR. In vivo studies showed that administration of JIN-A02 dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in the C797S+ xenograft mice model. Moreover, JIN-A02 shown to penetrate blood-brain barrier and exhibit anti-tumor activity in an intracranial tumor model. The strong potency and high selectivity of JIN-A02 for mutant EGFR may offer improved therapeutic window in the clinical setting vs available EGFR-TKIs. Methods: JIN-A02 is being evaluated in this Phase 1/2, multicenter, an open-label trial (NCT05394831) for subjects with advanced NSCLC harboring C797S and/or T790M mutation as a monotherapy. The primary object of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor effect for determining the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JIN-A02. The inclusion criteria are that the subject (¡Ý 18 years) must have an advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed progress disease (PD) after receiving approved standard EGFR-TKI therapies and/or platinum-based anticancer chemotherapy is allowed up to 1 time after using EGFR-TKI treatment with ECOG status 0 or 1. Before enrollment in the study, the EGFR mutation status is determined using either tumor tissue and/or plasma ctDNA. This study comprises three parts, dose escalation (Part A), dose exploration (Part B), and dose expansion (Part C). In Part A, dose escalation, comprised of 5 cohorts ranged from a starting dose of 12.5 mg P.O, QD to a top dose of 150 mg P.O, QD with every three subjects, is carried out where the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is evaluated in subjects with 28-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are evaluated for 21 days. In Part B, dose exploration is carried out to evaluate the safety of JIN-A02 further and to determine the RP2D using 2 preliminary effective dose levels from Part A in subjects. In Part C dose-expansion study, subjects (n=36 for each cohort) are divided into 5 different cohorts based on the EGFR mutation (both or single positive of C797S and T790M), and the anti-tumor activity of JIN-A02 is evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 at RP2D.

Management Science . 2020",2020,", Wang, Z","In nature, the eastern North American monarch population is known for its southward migration during the late summer/autumn from the northern USA and southern Canada to Mexico, covering thousands of miles. By simplifying and idealizing the migration of monarch butterflies, a new kind of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, called monarch butterfly optimization (MBO), a first of its kind, is proposed in this paper. In MBO, all the monarch butterfly individuals are located in two distinct lands, viz. southern Canada and the northern USA (Land 1) and Mexico (Land 2). Accordingly, the positions of the monarch butterflies are updated in two ways. Firstly, the offsprings are generated (position updating) by migration operator, which can be adjusted by the migration ratio. It is followed by tuning the positions for other butterflies by means of butterfly adjusting operator. In order to keep the population unchanged and minimize fitness evaluations, the sum of the newly generated butterflies in these two ways remains equal to the original population.

Stable coins aim to solve the volatility problem by pegging to a national currency, such as the US dollar, and are used as vehicle currencies for exchanging national currencies into non-stable cryptocurrencies. Using a rich dataset of signed trades and order books on multiple crypto exchanges, we examine how peg-sustaining arbitrage stabilizes the dollar price of the largest stable coin, Tether, as an alternative to the main mechanism with national-currency fixed rates, namely intervention by a central bank. We find that stable-coin issuance, the closest analogue to central-bank intervention, plays only a limited role in stabilization, pointing instead to the demand side as the fundamental stabilizing force. Order-flow data show that a 25 basis-point move requires arrival of a roughly two standard deviation change in net trading, equivalent to $3 million. Finally, we investigate which fundamentals drive the two-sided distribution of peg-price deviations; premiums are due to stable coins' role within the digital-asset economy as a safe-haven asset, whereas discounts derive from both liquidity effects and collateral concerns.",SemanticScholar(DOI),100,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5f488adc627019fe5a0a8060bb8bafa655184b2,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:Richard Lyons and Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj.

METHODS Adults with pathologically confirmed stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC, documented DEL19 or L858R EGFR mutation, and progression after EGFR-TKI treatment were randomly assigned 1:1 to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo once every 3 weeks plus four cycles of pemetrexed and carboplatin or cisplatin once every 3 weeks and then maintenance pemetrexed. Dual primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Final PFS testing was completed at the second interim analysis (IA2; data cutoff, December 3, 2021); OS was tested at final analysis (FA; data cutoff, January 17, 2023). Efficacy boundaries were one-sided P = .0117 for PFS and OS. RESULTS Four hundred ninety-two patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n = 245) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n = 247). At IA2, the median PFS was 5.6 months for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 5.5 months for placebo plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97]; P = .0122).

Reprinted with Commentary in: 20 th anniversary of the Bernstein Fabozzi/Jac","Background Ascaris lumbricoides cystatin (Al-CPI) prevents the development of allergic airway inflammation and dextran-induced colitis in mice models. It has been suggested that helminth-derived cystatins inhibit cathepsins in dendritic cells (DC), but their immunomodulatory mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to analyze the transcriptional profile of human monocyte-derived DC (moDC) upon stimulation with Al-CPI to elucidate target genes and pathways of parasite immunomodulation. Methods moDC were generated from peripheral blood monocytes from six healthy human donors of Denmark, stimulated with 1 ¦ÌM of Al-CPI, and cultured for 5 hours at 37¡ãC. RNA was sequenced using TrueSeq RNA libraries and the NextSeq 550 v2.5 (75 cycles) sequencing kit (Illumina, Inc). After QC, reads were aligned to the human GRCh38 genome using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software. Differential expression was calculated by DESEq2 and expressed in fold changes (FC). Cell surface markers and cytokine production by moDC were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results Compared to unstimulated cells, Al-CPI stimulated moDC showed differential expression of 444 transcripts (|FC| ¡Ý1.3). The top significant differences were in Kruppel-like factor 10 ( KLF10 , FC 3.3, P BH = 3 x 10- 136 ), palladin (FC 2, P BH = 3 x 10- 41 ), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR , FC 2.6, P BH = 5 x 10- 41 ). Upregulated genes were enriched in regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) signaling pathways and immune pathways. Several genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway showed significantly increased expression upon Al-CPI stimulation, even in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Regarding the pathway of negative regulation of immune response, we found a significant decrease in the cell surface expression of CD86, HLA-DR, and PD-L1 upon stimulation with 1 ¦ÌM Al-CPI. Conclusion Al-CPI modifies the transcriptome of moDC, increasing several transcripts encoding enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and SREBP signaling. Moreover, Al-CPI target several transcripts in the TNF-alpha signaling pathway influencing cytokine release by moDC. In addition, mRNA levels of genes encoding KLF10 and other members of the TGF beta and the IL-10 families were also modified by Al-CPI stimulation. The regulation of the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol biosynthesis suggests new mechanisms involved in DC responses to helminth immunomodulatory molecules.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W4392238281,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:  ¡°Alpha Signals, Smart Beta and Factor Model Alignment,¡± (with Paul Pfleiderer), Journal of Portfolio Management , May ",,,,Goal 16,0.009731059,FALSE,

However, we argue that regional business cycles contain valuable information that can help discipline models of aggregate fluctuations. We begin by documenting a strong relationship across U.S. states between local employment and wage growth during the Great Recession. This relationship is much weaker in U.S. aggregates. Then, we present a methodology that combines such regional and aggregate data in order to estimate a medium©\scale New Keynesian DSGE model. We find that aggregate demand shocks were important drivers of aggregate employment during the Great Recession, but the wage stickiness necessary for them to account for the slow employment recovery and the modest fall in aggregate wages is inconsistent with the flexibility of wages we observe across U.S. states.

Then, we build a heterogeneous household model of refinancing in order to derive aggregate implications of monetary policy from our regional evidence. We find that the 2008 equity distribution made spending in depressed regions less responsive to interest rate cuts, thus dampening aggregate stimulus and increasing regional consumption inequality, whereas the opposite occurred in some earlier recessions.

In order to assess the adverse effects of these models, it is important to quantify the bias captured in them.

The Review of Financial Studies . 2018",2018,"Enrico Moretti, Ulrike Malmendier","Cosmic filaments are prominent structures of the matter distribution of the Universe. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify filaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these methods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled spectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the filaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric redshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of larger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift precision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments extracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific survey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of filament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid Wide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare two filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the Euclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm DisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several characteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare skeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy positions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between filaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical considerations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We assess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify filaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey.

We propose TD-CARMA, a Bayesian method to estimate cosmological time delays by modeling observed and irregularly sampled light curves as realizations of a continuous auto-regressive moving average (CARMA) process. Our model accounts for heteroskedastic measurement errors and microlensing, an additional source of independent extrinsic long-term variability in the source brightness. The semiseparable structure of the CARMA covariance matrix allows for fast and scalable likelihood computation using Gaussian process modeling. We obtain a sample from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters using a nested sampling approach. This allows for ¡°painless¡± Bayesian computation, dealing with the expected multimodality of the posterior distribution in a straightforward manner and not requiring the specification of starting values or an initial guess for the time delay, unlike existing methods. In addition, the proposed sampling procedure automatically evaluates the Bayesian evidence, allowing us to perform principled Bayesian model selection. TD-CARMA is parsimonious, and typically includes no more than a dozen unknown parameters. We apply TD-CARMA to six doubly lensed quasars HS2209+1914, SDSS J1001+5027, SDSS J1206+4332, SDSS J1515+1511, SDSS J1455+1447, and SDSS J1349+1227, estimating their time delays as ?21.96 ¡À 1.448, 120.93 ¡À 1.015, 111.51 ¡À 1.452, 210.80 ¡À 2.18, 45.36 ¡À 1.93, and 432.05 ¡À 1.950, respectively.

These experiments inform behavioral theories of operations management, impacting domains including inventory, supply chain management, queuing, forecasting, and sourcing. Yet, until now, the replicability of most behavioral insights from these laboratory experiments has been untested. We remedy this with the first large-scale replication study in operations management. With the input of the wider operations management community, we identify 10 prominent experimental operations management papers published in Management Science, which span a variety of domains, to be the focus of our replication effort. For each paper, we conduct a high-powered replication study of the main results across multiple locations using original materials (when available and suitable). In addition, our study tests replicability in multiple modalities (in-person and online) due to laboratory closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our replication study contributes new knowledge about the robustness of several key behavioral theories in operations management and contributes more broadly to efforts in the operations management field to improve research transparency and reliability.

It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ¡«2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120¡ã long, 2.¡ã5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.",SemanticScholar(search),100,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ed7140951e75fafa4f864289d61b3f5305d9a79,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Jennifer N.

Author Notes Kathryn Hardy is an anthropologist interested in language, cinematic mediation, and ideas of the ¡®region¡¯ in India. She is currently revising her first book, Becoming Bhojpuri, which examines new social categories that emerge through the production and circulation of films in the Bhojpuri language. Kathryn received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, and is now a Mellon Fellow at Washington University in St. Louis. This book review is available in Journal of Religion & Film: http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol21/iss1/29 Review of William Elison, Christian Lee Novetzke, and Andy Rotman, Amar Akbar Anthony: Bollywood, Brotherhood, and the Nation (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2016). In a now-classic article from 1985, Rosie Thomas urged writers to take popular Indian films seriously. Indian as well as foreign critics, she argued, used racist Western frameworks to evaluate Indian cinema as low-brow, nonsensical, and mindless. Such critics failed to take into account the films¡¯ aesthetic specificity, as well as the historical conditions and political contexts in which they were produced and consumed. By defining Indian cinema ¡°primarily through its ¡®otherness¡¯ or ¡®difference¡¯ from First World cinema,¡± critics ignored the logics of pleasure that governed Hindi and other Indian cinemas. In the ensuing thirty years, Indian cinema¡ªspecifically the relatively upscale Hindi cinema glossed as ¡°Bollywood¡±¡ªhas become a topic of serious academic interest. The number of university courses and scholarly books on Indian cinema, often mentioning Bollywood directly, has skyrocketed since the mid-1990s. The emergence of ¡°Bollywood studies¡± accords with a more general academic acceptance of popular or ¡°public culture¡± as a legitimate field of research. This sudden respectability coincides with what Tejaswini Ganti calls the ¡°gentrification¡± of the Hindi film industry, a material reimagining of Hindi cinema as hip, modern, global, and¡ª most importantly¡ªfor the upper classes. Despite this flood of publications, few texts manage to maintain analytical rigor along with the enthusiasm of the 1 Hardy: Amar Akbar Anthony: Bollywood, Brotherhood, and the Nation Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2017 cinephile, and fewer still are accessible to students lacking a working knowledge of Indian cinema. Amar Akbar Anthony: Bollywood, Brotherhood, and the Nation should please both long-time Bollywood enthusiasts and those who are encountering Hindi cinema for the first time. In this delightful and adventurous new book, William Elison, Christian Lee Novetzke, and Andy Rotman bring the reader on a chooseyour-own-adventure tour through the twists and turns of one of India¡¯s most beloved films, Amar Akbar Anthony (dir. Manmohan Desai, 1977), answering Thomas¡¯ call to approach Indian cinema within its own ¡°terms of reference.¡± Amar Akbar Anthony was described by critics at the time of its release as ¡°implausible,¡± (6) and ¡°giant-sized escapist fare¡± (8). Even in current accounts, Amar Akbar Anthony has been ¡°too easily discounted as a cheesy and cumbersome 1970s artifact¡± (4). Writing collaboratively, the three authors plumb the depths of their collective knowledge of South Asian history, religion, language, and politics to resuscitate Amar Akbar Anthony and, in the process, frame mega-entertainment as embedded social practice. Amar Akbar Anthony, produced and released during the violence and paranoia of Indira Gandhi¡¯s Emergency, has usually been read as a parable depicting India¡¯s model of secularism as religious ¡°unity in diversity.¡± With symbolic echoes of India¡¯s Partition and subsequent post-colonial violence, the film begins with three young brothers whose (Hindu) family splits apart even before the title 2 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 21 [2017], Iss. 1, Art. 29 http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol21/iss1/29 sequence begins. In the aftermath of a series of disasters and mistakes, the boys¡¯ mother contracts tuberculosis, abandons the family, and is blinded by a falling tree; the boys¡¯ father accidentally steals a car full of gold ingots and leaves the three boys under a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in a park, and each boy is found, renamed, and raised according to a different religion. Amar is raised by a Hindu policeman, Akbar by a Muslim tailor, and Anthony by a Catholic priest. In the film¡¯s happy ending, the entire family is reunited. The religious divisions between Hindu, Christian, and Muslim are regularly revealed to be merely external artifice. In the title sequence, the three brothers are pictured in a hospital donating blood to their mother, all of them unaware of the true nature of their relationships with one another. Behind each brother is a window through which a religious building can be seen: Amar is framed by a temple, Anthony by a church, and Akbar by a mosque. This heady symbolic moment of medicalized ethno-nationalist unification is further overdetermined by the lyrics to the song that immediately follows: ¡°blood is blood, it isn¡¯t water.¡± Religious distinctions are perceptible on the outside, but these distinctions only serve to highlight the truth of familial connection, through which eight of the main characters in the film, in the end, come to be either consanguine or affinal kin. Can this be anything more than straightforward nationalist propaganda¡ªalbeit with an overlay of mass entertainment, catchy songs, romance, family-focused emotion, and choreographed violence? 3 Hardy: Amar Akbar Anthony: Bollywood, Brotherhood, and the Nation Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2017 But hold on a minute, write the authors of the book version of Amar Akbar Anthony: how could it possibly be that simple? Amar Akbar Anthony is a richly varied film, ¡°filled with contestation and even confusion, in which the logical and illogical are in harmony¡± (4). How are we to account for the inconsistency of the neat nationalist metaphor? Why don¡¯t the brothers revert to the practices of Hinduism once they realize their ¡°true selves¡±? Why does Bharati¡ªthe mother of the three boys, whose name references Bharat, another name for India¡ªabandon her sons to their fates? Instead of sanding off the contradictory edges in this masala masterpiece, the authors choose to approach the film through a method they describe as ¡°sibling rivalry.¡± By this they mean allowing internal inconsistency, ¡°offering differing and competing perspectives to create a kind of oneness¡ªor ¡®three-in-oneness.¡¯ ... One story is never the full story¡± (4). Material from Sanskrit texts, the Hindu epics, ethnographies, Sufi romances, the lives of the film¡¯s stars, director Manmohan Desai¡¯s interviews, and close readings of certain scenes are all juxtaposed in a gleeful rejection of a unitary theory of the film (or of film in general). The book proceeds as an increasingly contentious discussion among friends, whose arguments build on one another. The authors describe their approach using the metaphor of three blind men describing an elephant entirely by feel: ¡°Our goal is not... to provide a cohesive, noncontradictory, synthetic analysis¡ªbut to see what happens when this elephantine opus is perceived through its parts¡± (5). In 4 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 21 [2017], Iss. 1, Art. 29 http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol21/iss1/29 effect, this is the book¡¯s most forcefully argued thesis: by interpreting films (or, one might extrapolate, other works) only to extract a unitary conclusion under which other possibilities are quashed, we are doing a disservice to the complexity of cinema and society. The first three chapters are each named after a brother, and argue in turn that the titular brother of each chapter is in fact the ¡°hero¡± of the film. ¡°Amar: Straight Shooter¡± argues that Amar, raised by the Hindu police inspector, centers the story (and the country) with his ¡°unmarked but muscular form of Hinduism¡± (36). In this chapter, relationships are couched in terms of the ¡°classical Hindu idea...that the ¡®trinity¡¯ of dharma, artha, and kama (that is, ¡®duty,¡¯ ¡®profit,¡¯ and ¡®pleasure¡¯) are the three ¡®aims of human life¡¯ (purushartha)¡± (46). Amar is the dutiful, dharmik brother, ¡°the only one with a full-time job, the only one to dutifully follow his new father¡¯s career, and the only one to remain a Hindu¡± (47). Amar¡¯s lack of religious specificity¡ªhe is never seen participating in any practice of worship, though his name marks him as Hindu¡ªis balanced by the uniform that marks him as a policeman: he ¡°doesn¡¯t seem to have a private life separate from his role as state functionary¡± (54). He embodies the ideal Hindu nation¡ªwellarmed, capable of violence, but ultimately benevolent¡ªand as such is the brother chosen as ¡°the center of the moral universe¡± of the film (73). ¡°Akbar: Parda and Parody¡± argues that Akbar is the center around which the film revolves. Akbar is the hero of a ¡°Muslim subplot¡± with parodic echoes of the 5 Hardy: Amar Akbar Anthony: Bollywood, Brotherhood, and the Nation Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2017 midcentury Bombay film genre known as the ¡°Muslim social.¡± This subplot borrows from ¡°a fund of received images of Muslim identity¡± portraying an Islamic community that is tradition-bound, highly mannered, and antiquated (92). But it is Akbar¡¯s numerous song sequences that make the best argument for him as the leading man. These songs ¡°dissolve barriers¡ªillusory or ideological curtains¡ªthat prevent people from connecting with one another¡± (75). As a qawwal, or Sufi singer, Akbar ¡°takes on the persona of a truth-telling poet, deploying a set of antecedents valorized in Indo-Islamic literary and mystical discourses¡ªa persona that has already been disseminated at a popular level through the medium of cinema¡± (103).

Published in Abacus 52 (1): 2016.",2016,"¡°Asymmetrically Timely Loss Recognition and the Accrual Anomaly, Discussion of Konstantinidi et al","Asymmetrically timely loss recognition¡ªalso known as conditional conservatism in financial reporting¡ªis embedded in US GAAP earnings through practices such as lower-of-cost-or-market accounting for inventories (ASC 330, FASB, 2009a), goodwill impairments (ASC 350, FASB, 2009b), and asset write-downs (ASC 360, FASB, 2009c). Such conditionally conservative accounting practices mandate the more timely recognition of losses relative to gains through transitory negative accrual items (e.g., Basu, 1997; Ball and Shivakumar, 2006; Patatoukas and Thomas, 2011; Ball et al., 2013; Patatoukas and Thomas, 2015). A direct implication of asymmetrically timely loss recognition is asymmetry in the persistence of accruals depending on whether the firm experiences a gain or a loss in the current year: accruals should be less persistent for loss years relative to profit years. 1 Asymmetry in the persistence of accruals across profit and loss years has interesting implications for research on the pricing of accruals. Sloan (1996) provides evidence that investors overestimate the persistence of accruals by na?vely fixating on total earnings and, therefore, tend to undervalue low accrual firms and overvalue high accrual firms¡ªa phenomenon commonly referred to as the accrual anomaly. In the presence of conditional conservatism, na?ve earnings fixation would imply that investors tend to overestimate the persistence of accruals, especially in loss years. It follows that investors are more likely to misprice the accruals of loss firms and, therefore, Sloan's (1996) accrual anomaly, that is, the negative association between accruals and future abnormal stock returns, is predicted to be more pronounced for loss firms relative to profit firms. In contrast to this prediction, however, Konstantinidi et al. (2016) find that the accrual anomaly is significant for profit firms, while they do not find evidence of such an anomaly for loss firms. More specifically, Konstantinidi et al. (2016) measure accruals as the difference between accounting earnings less cash flows from operating activities, and find evidence of significantly positive hedge returns from buying/selling low/high accrual profit firms, while they find insignificant hedge returns when repeating the trading strategy for loss firms. The authors conclude that to the extent that the accrual anomaly reflects mispricing, the market failure appears to be rooted in the processing of accruals for profit firms rather than investors' na?ve earnings fixation. On the other hand, if the accrual anomaly reflects variation in risk premium, such variation would appear to be significant only for profit firms. Given the ongoing debate among academics about the origins of the accrual anomaly as well as the practical implications for the investment community, I revisit the accrual anomaly for subsamples of profit and loss firms using a broader measure of accruals. To this end, I start by measuring accruals as the difference between accounting earnings less free cash flows, that is, the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities as reported in the statement of cash flows. When compared to cash flows from operating activities, free cash flows match the flows in earnings more comprehensively and, therefore, the difference between earnings less free cash flows offers a broader measure of accruals and earnings quality (e.g., Richardson et al., 2005; Dechow and Ge, 2006; Dechow et al., 2011). Separating firms based on the sign of reported earnings, I find that although the accrual anomaly extends across profit and loss firms, it appears to be stronger for loss firms. The average hedge return from buying/selling low/high accrual loss firms is 16.99%, while the hedge return from buying/selling low/high accrual profit firms is 5.82%. Evidence of accrual mispricing further increases when I separate loss firms experiencing negative contemporaneous abnormal returns (roughly 72% of all loss firms), with the hedge return from buying/selling low/high accrual loss firms rising to 21.77%. Overall, the evidence suggests that the subsample of loss firms is more susceptible to accruals mispricing, which is consistent with the prediction that investors na?vely fixate on total earnings and, therefore, tend to overestimate the persistence of accruals, especially in loss years. The evidence presented here also highlights that inferences regarding variation in the accrual anomaly across profit and loss firms are sensitive to the measurement of the accrual component of earnings. Indeed, using a less comprehensive measure of accruals and alternative definitions of gains and losses, Konstantinidi et al. (2016) reach the opposite conclusion, namely that the accrual anomaly is stronger for profit firms and non-existent for loss firms. I obtain accounting data from the Compustat fundamental annual file and stock return data from the CRSP monthly returns file. 2 I measure accounting earnings (Xit) as income before extraordinary items per share scaled by average total assets per share. I extract the accrual portion of earnings using the cash flow statement approach, which becomes available after 1988. I measure accruals (Ait) as the difference between income before extraordinary items per share less free cash flows per share (i.e., the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities per share) scaled by average total assets per share. Following prior research, I use size-adjusted buy-and-hold stock returns to measure abnormal stock returns (rit+1). The size-adjusted return is computed as the 12-month buy-and-hold return including distributions and delisting returns in excess of the buy-and-hold return of firms with similar market capitalization. To mitigate the effect of missing delisting returns, if a delisting is due to liquidation I set delisting returns equal to ¨C30% for NYSE and AMEX firms and equal to ¨C55% for NASDAQ firms (e.g., Shumway, 1997; Shumway and Warther, 1999). The return measurement window is annual beginning with the first day of the fourth month after the fiscal year-end. The market capitalization portfolio cutoffs are determined as of the fiscal year-end. To align portfolio returns in calendar time, I restrict my sample to include only December fiscal year-end firms. Consistent with prior studies, I further restrict my sample to include only NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ non-financial firms. To reduce the effects of outliers, I trim observations in the top and bottom 1% of each annual cross-section of earnings and earnings components. To reduce the effect of penny stocks, I exclude firms with stock price per share less than $1 as of the fiscal year-end as well as stocks with average assets per share below $1 per share. My final sample includes 56,482 firm-year observations with non-missing earnings and earnings components over the 23-year period from 1989 to 2011. The Appendix summarizes the variables definitions. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics. The empirical distributions of earnings and earnings components are similar to those reported in prior research (e.g., Dechow and Ge, 2006). Earnings exhibit negative skewness with a mean value of ¨C0.012, while 32.1 of the observations report negative earnings. On average, accruals are positive with a mean value of 0.025, while free cash flows are negative with a mean value of ¨C0.037, which suggests that the average firm is raising financing. Earnings are positively correlated with the total accrual and free cash flow components. Accruals are strongly negatively correlated with free cash flows, which is consistent with accounting matching. Finally, consistent with prior evidence on stock return predictability, accruals (free cash flows) are negatively (positively) correlated with one-year-ahead abnormal stock returns. Prior to exploring variation in the accrual anomaly across profit and loss firms, I replicate Sloan's (1996) portfolio trading strategy. Specifically, for each year t, I sort firms into decile portfolios based on the annual cross-sectional distribution of accruals. Then, for each portfolio and each year I calculate the equal-weighted average abnormal stock return earned over the subsequent year t+1. Table 2 reports time-series average values of abnormal returns across decile portfolios based on accruals. First, I observe that there is tremendous variation in the average magnitude of accruals across portfolios, ranging from ¨C0.265 for the low accruals portfolio to 0.308 for the high accruals portfolio. Consistent with prior evidence, I find a negative association between accruals and one-year-ahead abnormal stock returns. Moving from low to high accrual portfolios, one-year-ahead abnormal returns decrease from 8.04% for the bottom decile portfolio to ¨C7.53% for the top decile portfolio. A trading strategy that takes a long position in low accrual firms and a short position in high accrual firms yields an average hedge return of 15.57% (t-statistic = 3.39, two-sided p-value = 0.003). 1 In summary, Table 2 provides significant evidence of stock return predictability based on accruals. Consistent with Sloan (1996), it appears that investors undervalue low accrual firms and overvalue high accrual firms. A risk-based explanation would require that unmodelled risk premia decrease with the magnitude of accruals. A comparison of my results with the evidence in Konstantinidi et al. (2016) suggests that the hedge return from buying/selling low/high accrual firms is larger when using a broader measure of accruals¡ªa finding consistent with prior research in the pricing of accruals (e.g., Richardson et al., 2005; Dechow et al., 2011). With 32.1% of the observations reporting negative earnings in the current year (see Table 1, Panel A), the question becomes whether and how the mix-up of loss firms and profit firms has the potential to affect inferences with respect to the magnitude and causes of the accrual anomaly. This question is especially relevant if the frequency of losses systematically varies with the magnitude of accruals. Indeed, Table 3 provides evidence that the frequency of loss firms generally decreases, although not monotonically, with the magnitude of accruals. The frequency of loss firms is 82.3% for the bottom accrual portfolio and 25.5% for the top accrual portfolio. Table 3 also presents the frequency of firms with negative accruals and negative free cash flows across decile portfolios of accruals. Looking across portfolios, I note that the frequency of negative free cash flow firms is 38.4% for the bottom accrual portfolio and 98.1% for the top accrual portfolio. Therefore, separating firms based on the sign of free cash flows would result in a significant mix-up of profit and loss firms. 1 A key message from Table 3 is that loss firms are over-represented in the bottom accrual portfolios relative to the top accrual portfolios and, therefore, inferences with respect to variation in the accrual anomaly can be affected by pooling loss firms with profit firms. Another is that the sign of earnings provides a comprehensive way to identify economic gains from losses capturing the combined magnitudes of accruals and free cash flows. Next, I revisit evidence of variation in the accrual anomaly across subsamples of profit and loss firms. Table 4 reports abnormal returns across portfolios based on accruals formed separately across subsamples of profit and loss firms. I separate firms into profit and loss subsamples based on the sign of income before extraordinary items reported in t. Effectively, Table 4 repeats Sloan's (1996) portfolio trading strategy conditioning on the sign of reported earnings. For each year t, I sort firms into portfolios based on the annual cross-sectional distribution of accruals separately for profit and loss firms (i.e., the portfolio sorts are conditional on the sign of reported earnings). While there are enough firm-year observations in the subsample of profit firms to ensure that there are no less than 100 stocks for each annual decile portfolio, this is not the case for the subsample of loss firms. Accordingly, I sort loss firms in quartile portfolios. Then, for each portfolio and each year, I calculate the equal-weighted average abnormal return earned over the subsequent year t+1 separately for profit and loss firms. Panels A and B of Table 4 report time-series average abnormal returns across portfolios based on accruals for profit firms and loss firms. Focusing on profit firms (38,361 observations), Panel A shows that average abnormal returns decrease from ¨C0.58% for the bottom accrual portfolio of profit firms to ¨C6.40% for the top accrual portfolio of profit firms. The trading strategy that takes a long position in low accrual profit firms and a short position in high accrual profit firms yields an average hedge return of 5.82% (t-statistic = 2.21, two-sided p-value = 0.038). Turning to Panel B, I find that the accrual anomaly is stronger for the subsample of loss firms (18,121 observations). Average abnormal returns decrease from 9.66% for low accrual loss firms to ¨C7.33% for high accrual loss firms, with an average hedge return of 16.99% (t-statistic = 5.26, two-sided p-value = 0.000). 0 As explained in the paper's introduction, in the presence of conditional conservatism, na?ve earnings fixation would imply that investors tend to overestimate the persistence of accruals, especially in loss years. Consistent with this story, I find evidence that the accrual, anomaly is stronger for the subsample of loss firms. A potential concern, however, is that partitioning the sample based on the sign of reported earnings does not provide a clean separation of firms experiencing economic losses. To alleviate this concern, I further identify loss firms experiencing negative contemporaneous abnormal returns (13,058 observations or roughly 72% of all loss firms). Panel C of Table 4 provides evidence that the accrual anomaly is even stronger for this subsample. Average abnormal returns decrease from 14.50% for low accrual loss firms to ¨C7.27% for high accrual loss firms, with an average hedge return of 21.77% (t-statistic = 4.56, two-sided p-value = 0.000). This finding is comforting if one believes that separating firms based on both the sign of reported earnings and the sign of contemporaneous abnormal returns provides a cleaner identification of firms experiencing economic losses in the current year. A direct implication of asymmetrically timely loss recognition due to conditionally conservative accounting practices is asymmetry in the persistence of accruals depending on whether the firm experiences a gain or a loss: accruals, should be less persistent for loss years relative to profit years. If investors na?vely fixate on total earnings, however, they will tend to overestimate the persistence of accruals, especially in loss years. Consistent with na?ve earnings fixation, I find that the accrual anomaly is more pronounced for loss firms relative to profit firms. The evidence highlights that inferences regarding variation in the accrual anomaly across profit and loss firms are sensitive to the measurement of the accrual component of earnings. Indeed, using a less comprehensive measure of accruals and alternative definitions of gains and losses, Konstantinidi et al. (2016) reach opposite conclusions, namely that the accrual anomaly is stronger for profit firms and non-existent for loss firms. By virtue of standard accounting identities, the broader measure of accruals employed in this study can be disaggregated into different components, including the change in non-cash working capital (i.e., the difference between the change in current operating assets less the change in current operating liabilities) and the change in non-current net operating assets (i.e., the difference between the change in non-current operating assets less the change in non-current operating liabilities). An interesting direction for future research would be to explore sources of variation in the pricing of different accrual components across profit and loss firms. Future research could also explore alternative, non-mutually exclusive explanations for the pricing of accruals across profit and loss firms, other than na?ve earnings fixation. One possibility is that unmodelled risk premia decrease with the magnitude accruals, especially for loss firms. Another possibility is that there are systematic differences in the investor-base sophistication (e.g., percentage retail ownership) and the intensity of market frictions (e.g., short sale constraints) across profit and loss firms. 1",OpenAlex(DOI),100,10.1111/abac.12063,https://openalex.org/W2484372234,2016,Abacus,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-biblio:¡°Asymmetrically Timely Loss Recognition and the Accrual Anomaly, Discussion of Konstantinidi et al.¡± solo-authored.

Patatoukas,Published in The Accounting Review 91 (2): 2016.,2016,Published in The Accounting Review 91 (2): 2016.,"In the heart of South Asia, a quiet revolution is unfolding, one inscribed not on the grime of highways but in the nooks of research, diplomacy, and unspoken aspirations. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a linchpin of China¡¯s Belt and Road Initiative, is reshaping the region¡¯s geopolitical landscape, trade routes, and connectivity far beyond its concrete highways and bustling ports. Yet, beneath the gleaming veneer of economic promises and infrastructural marvels, critical questions linger. What unseen costs and opportunities lie hidden in its wake? Who truly benefits, and at what ecological and social price? This study delves into the scholarly exploration of CPEC through a bibliometric analysis of SCOPUS database of published research articles (2016¨C2024), uncovering a surge in academic interest, tripling by 2024, yet exposing glaring gaps. Why environmental risks, educational transformations, and innovation strategies are so scarcely studied? Behind the statistics, a puzzle emerges: Whose voices dominate this discourse, and whose remain unheard? Is the narrative shaped more by geopolitical interests than grassroots realities? Despite the growing literature, research remains fragmented, like scattered pieces of a mosaic awaiting assembly; each study a snapshot, but none capturing the full panorama. Our work bridges these fragments, tracing CPEC¡¯s academic evolution, pinpointing omissions, and issuing a call to action. To scholars, policymakers, and global stakeholders: CPEC is not merely a corridor of commerce but a testbed for sustainable development and regional synergy. Beyond economics, it demands scrutiny of labor rights, cultural exchange, and climate resilience. This is no ordinary review, it is a compass for a world hungry for connection, urging a deeper dive into CPEC¡¯s untapped potential. The revolution is quiet, but its echoes demand to be heard and will serves as a compass in a society that longs for relationships. References Ahmed, Z., Nihei, T., &amp; Ali, N. (2025).

Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical trial of 1015 participants with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy, defined as P-wave terminal force greater than 5000 ¦ÌV ¡Á ms in electrocardiogram lead V 1 , serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 250 pg/mL, or left atrial diameter index of 3 cm/m 2 or greater on echocardiogram. Participants had no evidence of atrial fibrillation at the time of randomization. Enrollment and follow-up occurred from February 1, 2018, through February 28, 2023, at 185 sites in the National Institutes of Health StrokeNet and the Canadian Stroke Consortium. Interventions Apixaban, 5 mg or 2.5 mg, twice daily (n = 507) vs aspirin, 81 mg, once daily (n = 508). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary efficacy outcome in a time-to-event analysis was recurrent stroke. All participants, including those diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after randomization, were analyzed according to the groups to which they were randomized. The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and other major hemorrhage. Results With 1015 of the target 1100 participants enrolled and mean follow-up of 1.8 years, the trial was stopped for futility after a planned interim analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants was 68.0 (11.0) years, 54.3% were female, and 87.5% completed the full duration of follow-up. Recurrent stroke occurred in 40 patients in the apixaban group (annualized rate, 4.4%) and 40 patients in the aspirin group (annualized rate, 4.4%) (hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.64-1.55]). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0 patients taking apixaban and 7 patients taking aspirin (annualized rate, 1.1%). Other major hemorrhages occurred in 5 patients taking apixaban (annualized rate, 0.7%) and 5 patients taking aspirin (annualized rate, 0.8%) (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.29-3.52]). Conclusions and Relevance In patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without atrial fibrillation, apixaban did not significantly reduce recurrent stroke risk compared with aspirin.

Initially after the intervention, we observe a large housing gap in favor of treated units. As a result, non-treated households¡¯ aspirations to upgrade their housing increased sharply relative to the treatment group, echoing an aspiration to ¡°keep up with the treated Joneses¡±. The aspirational effect is mostly observed among dwellers residing in urban slums, with relatively high levels of income, and located close to treated neighbors. However, after 2 years of treatment exposure, the aspirational effect completely disappears and no effects are found on housing investment. Estimates based on a structural model of aspiration adaptation show that the decay rate is 38% per month, implying that housing aspirations return to baseline levels in just 28 months. Our evidence suggests that simply fostering housing aspirations may be insufficient to encourage housing investment in poor neighborhoods, and thus slum-upgrading policies designed to indirectly stimulate housing expansion may not be as effective as they promise to be.",SemanticScholar(search),100,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c29e16d64c9da41c33969aa162092dd960bf90f,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Sebastian Galiani  Sebastian Galiani, Paul J Gertler, and Raimundo Undurraga",,,,Goal 11,0.083963044,TRUE,housing affordability; housing for vulnerable populations

Are There Synergies from Combining Hygiene and Sanitation Promotion Campaigns: Evidence from a Large-Scale Cluster-Randomized Trial in Rural Tanzania . PLoS ONE . 2017",2017,"Bertha Brice?o, Aidan Coville, Paul Gertler, and Sebastian Martinez","Summary The current evidence on handwashing and sanitation programs suggests limited impacts on health when at-scale interventions have been tested in isolation. However, no published experimental evidence currently exists that tests the interaction effects between sanitation and handwashing. We present the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania, with the objective of tracing the causal chain from hygiene and sanitation promotion to changes in child health outcomes and specifically testing for potential interaction effects of combining handwashing and sanitation interventions. Methods The study is a factorial cluster-randomized control trial where 181 rural wards from 10 districts in Tanzania were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together or neither (control). Interventions were rolled out from February 2009 to June 2011 and the endline survey was conducted from May to November 2012, approximately one year after program completion. The sample was composed of households with children under 5 years old in the two largest villages in each ward. Masking was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, but enumerators played no part in the intervention and were blinded to treatment status. The primary outcome of interest was 7-day diarrhea prevalence for children under five. Intermediate outcomes of behavior change including improved latrine construction, levels of open defecation and handwashing with soap were also analyzed. Secondary health outcomes included anemia, height-for-age and weight-for-age of children under 5. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to assess the relationship between the interventions and outcomes of interest. Findings One year after the end of the program, ownership of improved latrines increased from 49.7% to 64.8% (95% CI 57.9%-71.7%) and regular open defecation decreased from 23.1% to 11.1% (95% CI 3.5%-18.7%) in sanitation promotion-only wards. Households in handwashing promotion-only wards showed marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation but not at other critical junctures. There were no detectable interaction effects for the combined intervention. The associated cost-per-household gaining access to improved sanitation is estimated to be USD $194. Final effects on child health measured through diarrhea, anemia, stunting and wasting were absent in all treatment groups. Interpretation Although statistically significant, the changes in intermediate outcomes achieved through each intervention in isolation were not large enough to generate meaningful health impacts. With no observable signs of interaction, the combined intervention produced similar results. The study highlights the importance of focusing on intermediate outcomes of take up and behavior change as a critical first step in large-scale programs before realizing the changes in health that sanitation and hygiene interventions aim to deliver.

Although environmental, clinical and social factors have a role in the chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-191,2, host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors may reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Here we describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses that consist of up to 49,562 patients with COVID-19 from 46 studies across 19 countries. We report 13 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases3¨C7. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role for smoking and body-mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 was made possible by the community of human genetics researchers coming together to prioritize the sharing of data, results, resources and analytical frameworks.

This paper examines how these two types of prominence interact in determining the click-through rate (CTR) of these ads. Using individual-level click-stream data from Microsoft¡¯s Live Search platform and measures of advertiser prominence from Alexa.com , we find that ad position and advertiser prominence are substitutes.

We analyze a large individual-level data set of mobile money transactions in Tanzania to provide evidence of the impact of mobile money on alleviating financial exclusion in developing countries. We identify three types of transactions: (i) money transfers to others, (ii) short-distance money self-transportation, and (iii) money storage for short to medium periods of time. We utilize a natural experiment of an unanticipated increase in transaction fees to identify the demand for these transactions. Using the demand estimates, we find that the willingness to pay to avoid walking with cash an extra kilometer (short-distance self-transportation) and to avoid storing money at home (money storage) for an extra day are 1.25% and 0.8% of an average transaction, respectively, which demonstrates that mobile money ameliorates significant amounts of crime-related risk. We explore the implications of these estimates for pricing and demonstrate the profitability of incentive-compatible price discrimination based on type of service, consumer location, and distance between transaction origin and destination.

Nine preregistered studies (<i>N</i> = 6,953) show that individuals' approach to resolving interpersonal debt varies based on their closeness with the requestee. Specifically, people prefer communication methods low in social richness (e.g., digital apps) when requesting money back from weak social connections such as distant acquaintances. However, they prefer communication methods high in social richness (e.g., in-person interactions) when requesting money back from strong social connections such as close friends. Process evidence reveals the psychological dynamics at play: (a) people anticipate discomfort when requesting money back from distant acquaintances in person, driving them away from in-person requests and toward digital apps, and (b) people are more averse to appearing impersonal with close friends, driving them away from digital apps and toward in-person requests.

Past work finds that group members seek to maximize relative differences between their in-group and out-group (¡°in-group favoritism¡±) and are driven by a desire to benefit in-groups rather than harm out-groups (the ¡°in-group love¡± hypothesis). This prior research studies how decision-makers approach trade-offs between two net-positive outcomes for their in-group. However, in the real world, group members often face trade-offs between net-negative options, entailing either losses to their group or gains for the opposition. Anecdotally, under such conditions, individuals may avoid supporting their opponents even if this harms their own group, seemingly inconsistent with ¡°in-group love¡± or a harm minimizing strategy. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, these circumstances have not been investigated. In six pre-registered studies, we find consistent evidence that individuals prefer to harm their own group rather than provide even minimal support to an opposing group across polarized issues (abortion access, political party, gun rights). Strikingly, in an incentive-compatible experiment, individuals preferred to subtract more than three times as much from their own group rather than support an opposing group, despite believing that their in-group is more effective with funds. We find that identity concerns drive preferences in group decision-making, and individuals believe that supporting an opposing group is less value-compatible than harming their own group.

Financial Management . 2017",2017,Stanton and N,"Objective: The aim of this study was to review existing research into driver control transitions and to determine the time it takes drivers to resume control from a highly automated vehicle in noncritical scenarios. Background: Contemporary research has moved from an inclusive design approach to adhering only to mean/median values when designing control transitions in automated driving. Research into control transitions in highly automated driving has focused on urgent scenarios where drivers are given a relatively short time span to respond to a request to resume manual control. We found a paucity in research into more frequent scenarios for control transitions, such as planned exits from highway systems. Method: Twenty-six drivers drove two scenarios with an automated driving feature activated. Drivers were asked to read a newspaper, or to monitor the system, and to relinquish, or resume, control from the automation when prompted by vehicle systems. Results: Significantly longer control transition times were found between driving with and without secondary tasks. Control transition times were substantially longer than those reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Conclusion: We found that drivers take longer to resume control when under no time pressure compared with that reported in the literature. Moreover, we found that drivers occupied by a secondary task exhibit larger variance and slower responses to requests to resume control. Workload scores implied optimal workload. Application: Intra- and interindividual differences need to be accommodated by vehicle manufacturers and policy makers alike to ensure inclusive design of contemporary systems and safety during control transitions.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2579937995,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:R.

Using a difference-in-differences approach and administrative data covering both presumptive taxpayers and comparable small corporate income taxpayers, we find that the number of small business taxpayers filing tax returns and presumptive tax revenues increased substantially after the interventions.

Working Paper . 2018,2018,Kenneth T,"This paper provides estimates of the net depreciation rate for rental housing using a unique confidential data set from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that covers over 30,000 rental units from 1998 to 2009. Our data and econometric approach allow us to add to the literature in three main ways. First, we can control for unobserved quality (including cohort effects) by allowing for unit-specific fixed effects. Our results suggest that estimates of the depreciation rate for rental housing that ignore unobserved heterogeneity suffer from omitted-variable bias and potentially from selection bias, and that these biases can be large. Second, we use a dummy-variable approach to estimate aging effects, thereby avoiding ad hoc assumptions about functional form. We find that rent for a typical housing unit at first falls rapidly with age, flattens, and then begins to rise with age for older units. This nonmonotonic pattern is a feature of many other studies of both age?rent and age?price profiles for housing, and it seems likely that the upward-sloped portion of such profiles is the result of unobserved improvements and changes in style. We show that the upward slopes of our estimated profiles are only partially eliminated when we attempt to control for major improvements by excluding housing units that see very large jumps in rent. Third, we present estimates of age?rent profiles separately for different types of structures and for different regions of the country.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W2585123499,,,likely_no_public_abstract,CR-biblio:Kenneth T.

Working Paper . 2018,2018,Kenneth T,"We continue our examination of inclusive growth at the firm level by examining heterogeneity in rent sharing in New Zealand using linked employer-employee data. We test for heterogeneity in rent sharing across a range of worker and firm characteristics including gender, ethnicity, age, qualifications, tenure, firm size, firm age, and industry. We also refine our measure of quasirents and estimate the level of excess quasi-rents per worker, or the amount of rents above the threshold beyond which rent sharing occurs. We find that between 20% and 30% of workers are in firms that earn zero excess rents. These workers are concentrated in the hospitality, administrative services, and retail industries and are more likely to be women, to be M¨¡ori or Pacific peoples, and have lower-level qualifications. We find an overall rent-sharing elasticity of 0.03, which is equivalent to a $38 increase in annual wages in response to a $1,000 increase in excess rents per worker. We find differences in rent sharing by levels of highest qualification, tenure, and ethnicity. We find no differences in rent sharing by firm size or firm age. Rent sharing is similar across industries, with workers in most industries receiving between $1,500 and $2,000 of rents per year. The auxiliary finance and professional, scientific, and technical services sectors share the most, while grocery retailing, food and beverage manufacturing and utilities share the least. Insurance type behaviour by firms is consistent with the variation in rent sharing across industries, although differences in bargaining power are also likely to play a role in explaining differences in rent sharing across groups",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W4289890631,,,likely_no_public_abstract,CR-biblio:Kenneth T.

Existing methods for computing sentence similarity have been adopted from approaches used for long text documents. These methods process sentences in a very high-dimensional space and are consequently inefficient, require human input, and are not adaptable to some application domains. This paper focuses directly on computing the similarity between very short texts of sentence length. It presents an algorithm that takes account of semantic information and word order information implied in the sentences. The semantic similarity of two sentences is calculated using information from a structured lexical database and from corpus statistics. The use of a lexical database enables our method to model human common sense knowledge and the incorporation of corpus statistics allows our method to be adaptable to different domains. The proposed method can be used in a variety of applications that involve text knowledge representation and discovery.

In this paper we identify a variety of product innovation opportunities in India and elaborate on the strategic imperatives for Indian firms that attempt to exploit these emerging opportunities. Products innovations in India require tight control on the price-performance equation as Indian customers are price sensitive and demand good value. There is a higher chance for success in marketing adequate functionality or minimal feature products that communicate a clear benefit for users. We suggest that Indian firms can gainfully adopt a focus cost leadership strategy in niche markets where they can gain first mover advantages, as this provides the highest potential for Indian firms to exploit these emerging product innovation opportunities.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology . 2021",2021,"Belmi, P","People behave differently when at work than not at work; for example, they are less interested in making close friends and use more transactional language (networking vs. socializing). These examples hint at a broader phenomenon: that people engage in more objectification-treating people akin to objects-in work contexts than non work contexts. We propose that objectification is more prevalent at work because people engage in more calculative and strategic thinking (i.e., making decisions by computing the costs and benefits). Seven studies (<i>N</i> = 2,712) test this. In Study 1, participants objectified the same individuals more when they were pictured at work (e.g., in an office) than not at work (e.g., in a coffee shop). In Study 2, there was more objectification when the same event was framed as more (vs. less) work-related. Studies 3a and 3b (experience-sampling studies with 2,300 data points) show that working adults objectify others more during work than non work interactions and demonstrate which situational characteristics enhance objectification. Study 4 manipulates the proposed mechanism: Participants nudged to think less calculatively and strategically showed a reduced tendency to objectify others in work contexts. Considering consequences, job applicants in Study 5 who read company mission statements containing more calculative language expected more objectification and were less interested in applying. Moreover, employees who perceived more objectification in their workplace reported more negative work experiences (e.g., feeling lower belonging, experiencing more incivility; Study 6). Together, these studies provide insight into how objectification arises, where it occurs, and its consequences.

Potassium channels are important regulators of electrical signalling, and benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), an autosomal dominant epilepsy of infancy, is caused by mutations in the KCNQ2 or the KCNQ3 potassium channel genes2,3,4. Here we show that KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are distributed broadly in brain with expression patterns that largely overlap. Expression in Xenopus oocytes indicates the formation of heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 potassium channels with currents that are at least tenfold larger than those of the respective homomeric channels. KCNQ2/KCNQ3 currents can be increased by intracellular cyclic AMP, an effect that depends on an intact phosphorylation site in the KCNQ2 amino terminus. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations identified in BFNC pedigrees compromised the function of the respective subunits, but exerted no dominant-negative effect on KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromeric channels. We predict that a 25% loss of heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3-channel function is sufficient to cause the electrical hyperexcitability in BFNC.

With growing interest in the psychology of ritual, the current paper provides an organizing framework to understand recent empirical work from social psychology, cognitive science, anthropology, behavioral economics, and neuroscience. Our framework focuses on three primary regulatory functions of rituals: regulation of (1) emotions, (2) performance goal states, and (3) social connection. We examine the possible mechanisms underlying each function by considering the bottom-up processes that emerge from the physical features of rituals and top-down processes that emerge from the psychological meaning of rituals. Our framework, by appreciating the value of psychological theory, generates novel predictions and enriches our understanding of ritual and human behavior more broadly.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u51728,https://openalex.org/W4235872138,2007,Who Was Who,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-biblio:Hobson  Hobson, N","Hobson, Baron, (Charles Rider Hobson) (1904¨C17 Feb. 1966)",10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u51728,,Goal 1,0.019597229,FALSE,

To the contrary, in many respects the evidence indicates that the observed changes in many industries are likely to reflect competition in action.

Our language-based measure identifies prescient actors and documents that prevailing methods would fail to detect. Applying our model to corpora spanning the disparate worlds of politics, law, and business, we demonstrate that it reliably detects prescient ideas in each domain. Moreover, counter to many prevailing intuitions, prescient ideas emanate from each domain¡¯s periphery rather than its core.

However, a strong tie between the PCP and specialist also reduces the expertise match between a patient¡¯s health condition and a specialist¡¯s clinical experience.

Antitrust Law Journal . May 2025",2025,"Understanding Dynamic Competition: New Perspectives on Potential Competition, ¡°Monopoly,¡± and Market Power",": Adjustment of government-market relations in the context of deepening transformation of the socialist market economy system is not only the core proposition of the theoretical innovation of the socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics, but also the strategic issue of systematic openness in the transformation of the global governance system. This paper takes the fair competition review system as a research sample, and based on the cross-analytical framework of institutional economics and regulatory jurisprudence, systematically explains the regulatory logic and realization path of this institutional innovation on the dynamic adjustment of government-market relations in the transition period. The study shows that the evolution of China' s fair competition review system is characterized by the synergistic evolution of the triple logic of politics, economy and rule of law - in the political dimension, it is the dialectical unity of political leadership and system supply under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, and in the economic dimension, it reflects the deepening demand for the reform of market allocation of factors to break administrative monopoly, while in the rule of law dimension, it shows the deepening demand for the reform of market allocation of factors to break administrative monopoly. The dimension of the rule of law highlights the inherent requirements of the transformation from administrative control to the rule of law governance paradigm. Through the construction of the ""pilot-propagation"" system implementation mechanism, the dynamic balance between the central coordination of regulatory authority and local exploration of system innovation has been realized, forming a paradigmatic model of gradual and adaptive system innovation. From the perspective of system effectiveness, this model not only effectively regulates the path-dependent inertia of the traditional planned economy system, but also prospectively prevents the externality risk of the neo-liberal governance paradigm, and provides an institutional innovation paradigm for the emerging market economies to build a modern economic governance system in which the government is competent, the market is effective, and the rule of law is in order. The theoretical value of this paper lies in the fact that by revealing the composite power mechanism of political potential, market law and rule of law in the process of China' s institutional change, it not only expands the explanatory dimension of institutional economics theory in transition economies, but also, more importantly, constructs an autonomous knowledge system of the basic theories of competition policy; and its practical revelation lies in the fact that it provides an operational system optimization for the construction of a new era of perfecting the market-determined factor allocation mechanism and advancing the rule of law-oriented business environment. Its practical revelation is that it provides an operable system optimization path for improving the market-determined factor allocation mechanism and promoting the rule of law business environment in the new era.",SemanticScholar(DOI),100,10.2139/ssrn.5356023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0df772da14e2aa17c6d69dc03ff435324095821e,2025,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-biblio:David J.

Academy of Management Perspectives . 2023,2023,Big Tech and Strategic Management: How Management Scholars Can Inform Competition Policy,"Companies today are switching towards data-driven product strategies to keep pace with the rapidly evolving marketplace, where consumer demands and ever-changing business objectives need to be met. The formulation of these strategies is incomplete without a market, which serves as the backbone and provides information regarding consumer preferences, trends within the market, competition details, and a complete breakdown of product attributes. The pace of technological advancement has enabled businesses to discover an enormous pool of data that can be analyzed for strategic decision-making. The following paper outlines these fundamental principles and practices in market research for building data-driven product strategies, discussing how insights gleaned from market research inform product development, identify new opportunities, refine pricing strategy, and improve customer satisfaction. This paper goes on to discuss different methods of research, such as surveys, focus groups, customer interviews, and secondary research, that make data work in improving product positioning while focusing on the needs of the audience. It also discusses the impact of emerging tech, like big data analytics and AI-driven insights, over the market research practice. Last but not least, this paper provides recommendations for how businesses can incorporate market research into each step of developing a product strategy so as to sustain in the complex and competitive environment of modern product management. They also note that the increasing role of real-time data and customer feedback in perfecting product strategies underlines a long-term competitive edge, with market trends being continuously monitored by companies who live on their ability to act fast. Predictive analytics will allow for even better prediction of customer needs, giving businesses a much more proactive approach to product development. This is essential for success in the long run. Within the modern data-driven business ecosystem, as companies unlock this capability through these advanced tools, the part played by market research in innovation and product lifecycle optimization will only be amplified.

However, many small SIP firms fail to create value and adopt a viable business model. This article aims to investigate the value creation mechanism within the SIP business by drawing on the business model and dynamic capabilities views of the firm. First, the authors classify the forms and types of SIP from a technology and market perspective. Analyzing ten leading SIP firms, three SIP business models based on resources, competencies, and strategies are then identified. Dynamic capabilities are then linked to the selection and implementation of classified business models. Findings of the study suggest that existing SIP business models primarily favor large vendors. Keystone business model is proposed as a possible successful business model for small vendors. Consequently, this article provides insights and opportunities for leveraging the SIP ecosystem and business model innovation for small firms in the industry.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,10.2139/ssrn.5108136,https://openalex.org/W3128975413,2025,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-biblio:David J.

Using economic principles, the field of strategic management has developed a nuanced approach to understanding how firms are created, organized, and grow; how they innovate and compete; and how managers manage. That approach has yielded a theoretical framework known as ¡®dynamic capabilities¡¯. Contrasts are drawn between dynamic capabilities and other approaches to the theory of the firm, including transaction cost economics and agency theory. The application of capability theory allows intellectual blinders to be removed and an understanding of differential firm-level resource allocation and performance to emerge.

It is unknown whether anticoagulation, which has proven benefit in atrial fibrillation, prevents stroke in patients with atrial cardiopathy and no atrial fibrillation. Objective To compare anticoagulation vs antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention in patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical trial of 1015 participants with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy, defined as P-wave terminal force greater than 5000 ¦ÌV ¡Á ms in electrocardiogram lead V 1 , serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 250 pg/mL, or left atrial diameter index of 3 cm/m 2 or greater on echocardiogram. Participants had no evidence of atrial fibrillation at the time of randomization. Enrollment and follow-up occurred from February 1, 2018, through February 28, 2023, at 185 sites in the National Institutes of Health StrokeNet and the Canadian Stroke Consortium. Interventions Apixaban, 5 mg or 2.5 mg, twice daily (n = 507) vs aspirin, 81 mg, once daily (n = 508). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary efficacy outcome in a time-to-event analysis was recurrent stroke. All participants, including those diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after randomization, were analyzed according to the groups to which they were randomized. The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and other major hemorrhage. Results With 1015 of the target 1100 participants enrolled and mean follow-up of 1.8 years, the trial was stopped for futility after a planned interim analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants was 68.0 (11.0) years, 54.3% were female, and 87.5% completed the full duration of follow-up. Recurrent stroke occurred in 40 patients in the apixaban group (annualized rate, 4.4%) and 40 patients in the aspirin group (annualized rate, 4.4%) (hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.64-1.55]). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0 patients taking apixaban and 7 patients taking aspirin (annualized rate, 1.1%). Other major hemorrhages occurred in 5 patients taking apixaban (annualized rate, 0.7%) and 5 patients taking aspirin (annualized rate, 0.8%) (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.29-3.52]). Conclusions and Relevance In patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without atrial fibrillation, apixaban did not significantly reduce recurrent stroke risk compared with aspirin.

We present a theoretical framework that distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to give, for example, due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals would rather not give but dislike saying no, for example, due to social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raiser in which some households are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on their doorknobs. Thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 9% to 25% and, if the flyer allows checking a Do Not Disturb box, reduces giving by 28% to 42%. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than $10. These findings suggest that social pressure is an important determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from this and a complementary field experiment, we structurally estimate the model. The estimated social pressure cost of saying no to a solicitor is $3.80 for an in-state charity and $1.40 for an out-of-state charity.

We present the third data release of the European Space Agency¡¯s Gaia mission, Gaia DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of Gaia sources. Aims. We outline the content and the properties of Gaia DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release. Methods. The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Results. The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G , G BP , and G RP pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges G RVS &lt; 14 and 3100 &lt; T eff &lt; 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia . We provide G RVS magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. Conclusions. This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based.

Quarterly Journal of Economics . 2016,2016,Ulrike Malmendier and S,"Abstract How do individuals form expectations about future inflation? We propose that individuals overweight inflation experienced during their lifetimes. This approach modifies existing adaptive learning models to allow for age-dependent updating of expectations in response to inflation surprises. Young individuals update their expectations more strongly than older individuals since recent experiences account for a greater share of their accumulated lifetime history. We find support for these predictions using 57 years of microdata on inflation expectations from the Reuters/Michigan Survey of Consumers. Differences in experiences strongly predict differences in expectations, including the substantial disagreement between young and old individuals in periods of highly volatile inflation, such as the 1970s.

The differences in revaluation do not revert over longer horizons. We find no evidence that future takeover activities or operational changes explain these differences. While the targets of failed cash and stock offers are both more likely to be acquired over the following 8 years than matched control firms, there are no differences between cash and stock targets, neither in the timing nor in the value of future offers. Similarly, we cannot detect differential operational policies following the failed bid. Our results are most consistent with cash bids revealing prior undervaluation of the target.

Management Science . 2018,2018,Miguel Villas-Boas and Qiaowei Shen,"This paper considers the effect of firms sending advertising messages to consumers based on their past purchase behavior. If past purchase behavior on a product category is positively correlated with a consumer having high preferences in another category, a firm may want to advertise more intensively to those consumers that purchased the former category, if possible. This paper finds that this can lead to lower prices in the initial category if the annoyance of receiving advertising is large, and to higher prices if the annoyance of receiving advertising is not too large, as consumers expect a possible additional surplus from the category affected by behavior-based advertising. If receiving advertising does not yield too much annoyance to consumers, firms end up better off due to both higher prices and the increased demand of better matching of advertising. Behavior-based advertising may also lead firms to sell less in the initial category than without behavior-based advertising, as a way to be able to better target the most valuable consumers. If the consumer annoyance of receiving advertising is large, firms may end up serving only a few consumers initially, as attracting more consumers requires prices that are too low, and the initial consumers are attracted because of the possibility of lower prices in the following period.

Management Science . 2016",2016,"Tony Ke, Zuo-Jun Max Shen, J","We develop a framework for continuous search for information on a choice set of multiple alternatives and apply it to consumer search in a product market. When a consumer considers purchasing a product in a product category, the consumer can gather information sequentially on several products. At each moment, the consumer can choose which product to gather more information on and whether to stop gathering information and purchase one of the products or to exit the market with no purchase. Given costly information gathering, consumers end up not gathering complete information on all the products and need to make decisions under imperfect information. Under the assumption of constant informativeness of search, we solve for the optimal search, switch, and purchase or exit behavior in such a setting, which is characterized by an optimal consideration set and a purchase threshold structure. This paper shows that a product is only considered for search or purchase if it has a sufficiently high expected utility. Given multiple products in the consumer¡¯s consideration set, the consumer only stops searching for information and purchases a product if the difference between the expected utilities of the top two products is greater than some threshold. Comparative statics show that negative information correlation among products widens the purchase threshold, and so does an increase in the number of the choices. Under our rational consumer model, we show that choice overload can occur when consumers search or evaluate multiple alternatives before making a purchase decision. We also find that it is optimal for a monopolistic seller of multiple products to facilitate information search for low-valuation consumers and obfuscate information for those with high valuations.

Qualifying a product at a site commonly takes several months and hundreds of hours of engineering effort. These decisions are especially challenging because Western Digital Silicon Operations offers thousands of products; and demands more than a month or two into the future are very uncertain, as they are with many electronic products. Therefore, because shortages result in lost sales, the company must consider both expected demand and demand uncertainty. We solve the problem as a mixed-integer stochastic program with multiple stages of recourse, using a linear programming solver for the recourse stages and a greedy heuristic to determine the site qualifications. Western Digital deployed the model starting in the first quarter of 2015 and established a quarterly process for making site-qualification decisions.

Expansion of T follicular helper (TFH) and T peripheral helper (TPH) cells, two T cell populations that provide help to B cells, is a prominent feature of SLE3,4. Human TFH and TPH cells characteristically produce high levels of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 (refs.&#8201;5,6), yet regulation of T cell CXCL13 production and the relationship between CXCL13+ T cells and other T cell states remains unclear. Here, we identify an imbalance in CD4+ T cell phenotypes in patients with SLE, with expansion of PD-1+/ICOS+ CXCL13+ T cells and reduction of CD96hi IL-22+ T cells. Using CRISPR screens, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a potent negative regulator of CXCL13 production by human CD4+ T cells. Transcriptomic, epigenetic and functional studies demonstrate that AHR coordinates with AP-1 family member JUN to prevent CXCL13+ TPH/TFH cell differentiation and promote an IL-22+ phenotype. Type I interferon, a pathogenic driver of SLE7, opposes AHR and JUN to promote T cell production of CXCL13. These results place CXCL13+ TPH/TFH cells on a polarization axis opposite from T helper 22&amp;nbsp;(TH22) cells and reveal AHR, JUN and interferon as key regulators of these divergent T cell states.

Katz (bio) I first met Stan Kutler when I flew to Madison to be interviewed for an assistant professorship in the University of Wisconsin History Department in late March 1965. We spent only six years as departmental colleagues, but over the remaining years we remained in almost weekly touch, first by telephone and then by e-mail. We were close friends, collaborators, and co-conspirators for almost exactly fifty years, and few readers of RAH will be old enough to know how tough it is to have such a relationship so rudely interrupted. Stan and I were both legal and constitutional historians, so we were immediately drawn together professionally. UW at that time was the leading institution for the Law and Society movement, and one of the glories of the university was that it provided an unusually rich intellectual environment for scholars in our field. But we were also attracted by our commitment to undergraduate teaching in an institution that, for a brief period, had a spectacularly interesting and bright student body. It was our interest in teaching that led us to our first collaboration in publishing, Perspectives In American History, a two-volume reader for undergraduate survey courses. It was widely referred to as Katz and Kutler (Stan never forgave me for coming before him in the alphabet)¡ªand soon we were called ¡°katzandkutler.¡± We prided ourselves in publishing only cutting-edge and rather difficult articles, and gloried in the thanks we got from teachers in regional institutions for whom Perspectives was one of the few ways to connect their students to quality literature in the pre-JSTOR era. Of course, our most important collaboration was in the creation of this journal. It was entirely Stan¡¯s idea. He was frustrated by what he considered the futility of short book reviews in the major professional history journals and was determined to find a way to publish much longer and more critical reviews. I can still remember him telling me about the idea over lunch and remarking that he thought he had found a publisher. After the deal was signed and sealed, he sent me the documentation, which revealed to me for the first time that I was the Associate Editor. I tried to explain to colleagues that not only was it Stan¡¯s creation, but that he was doing nearly all of the editorial [End Page 397] work. The truth was that I was thrilled that so many historians thought I was involved. I was, but in very minor ways. Stan did all of the basic work of selecting books and soliciting authors, and then of editing the reviews¡ªmy role was mainly to kibbutz the selection process. And for years the process kept us in close touch. I hope that readers will agree that few individuals have done as much to help the profession (especially in the preparation of graduate students) as Stan did in founding RAH. I consider it more important than what he did for RMN. Others will speak of Stan¡¯s scholarly accomplishments. I simply want to say that I have never known anyone who was more fun to be with. My lasting memory is of his fiendish grin, full-bellied laugh, and healthy appetite for good, sturdy food. What a good guy he was! [End Page 398] Stanley N. Katz Stanley N.

Systems of corporate governance embody incentives, authority patterns, and norms of legitimation that generate particular organizational propensities to create competitive advantages and disadvantages. For comparative purposes, the characteristics of managerial, alliance, and family governance are reviewed. The impact of a family's control rights over a firm's assets generates three dominant propensities (parsimony, personalism, and particularism).

Focusing on the location of the parent firm for which the founder worked pre-founding as an important determinant of the human and social capital that the founder can instill into the spawn at founding, we examine how the location of the parent firm influences the post-founding performance of entrepreneurial spawns in the hedge fund sector. We find that hedge fund managers who previously worked for parent firms located in the industry hubs¡ªNew York and London¡ªoutperform their peers, regardless of the employer quality and where the actual hedge fund is located. We also find that this effect is greater if the entrepreneur worked in a job pre-founding that is highly related to hedge fund management. Our results are robust to controls for selection into job spells in New York/London. The evidence suggests that working in the industry¡¯s geographical hub pre-founding increases the nascent entrepreneurs¡¯ human and social capital which critically ¡°imprints¡± the new spawns, and thereby lastingly influences the spawns¡¯ capabilities and post-founding performance. Further, it also suggests that entrepreneurs who pre-founding worked in a more related job to the new venture¡¯s industry are more likely to benefit from the spillover of relevant knowledge and accumulation of relevant social capital in the industry hub pre-founding.

The AFC involved the emergence of a number of mismatches, the experience of which the AFC triggered a series of changes, including those related to exchange rate regimes and bond markets as well as a swap arrangements and regulatory reform. Those reforms however were not sufficient to avoid the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), a decade later, though they did add to the ability of the region to withstand the global shock. Reforms after this shock included work at global level to strengthen the banking systems and further development of bond markets. Swap arrangements were improved and a macro monitoring group set up. The region¡¯s financial markets are still dominated by banks, and equity and bond markets remain relatively underdeveloped. Financial systems are less complex in the region but there is growth of shadow banks and new types of instruments. Exchange rate arrangements are evolving, with the possibility of less reliance on the US dollar and more use of the RMB for transactions and as a store of value. Overall, much progress has been made on financial market integration but a lot of work remains. The diversity of the region provides opportunities in integration but also complicates the process. A number of forces will drive the next rounds of reform and integration, including the development of new e-payment systems (led by China), the disruptions to traditional banking services from fintech (trade finance, for instance), the contribution of crypto-currencies to lower the costs of managing payment systems, and other uncertainties associated with the shifts in design of supply chains and with the tensions between the major trading partners.

This new organization may be one in which they both participate as shareholders, but not all joint ventures are equity based. One of the most logical reasons for why companies enter into equity alliance is the financing needs of one of the companies involved. Joint ventures can be used for any conceivable goal.

I use financial statement analysis to examine systematic stock-valuation effects of aggregate price-level changes on individual companies, focusing on the implications for both researchers and investment practitioners. I develop inflation-adjustment procedures that are straightforward for investors to implement in real time for extracting the inflation effect on individual companies. I find that inflation-based investment strategies conditioned on information available to investors as of the initial investment and rebalancing dates result in significant risk-adjusted returns. I also investigate the sources of abnormal returns to inflation-based investment strategies. Specifically, I estimate two separate components of the inflation effect on individual companies, one based on only monetary holdings (using the net position of monetary holdings) and the other based on only nonmonetary holdings. Investigating the stock-valuation implications of extracting the components-based inflation effect reveals striking evidence. In particular, investing based on the inflation effect on companies¡¯ net monetary holdings results in insignificant abnormal hedge returns. In contrast, investing based on the inflation effect on companies¡¯ nonmonetary holdings consistently yields economically and statistically significant abnormal hedge returns. These findings indicate that inflation-based abnormal hedge returns are driven not by the exposure of companies¡¯ net monetary holdings to inflation but, rather, by the exposure of their nonmonetary holdings to inflation. These results are consistent with the fact that companies¡¯ nonmonetary holdings are usually held for several years and thus accumulate inflationary effects over time whereas their monetary holdings are, on average, naturally hedged because the exposure of monetary assets cancels the exposure of monetary liabilities for the average company. In addition, I examine the direction of the stock returns to real-time investment strategies.",,"Abstract : This study sheds new light on the cross-sectional effects of inflation, which have substantial implications for stock valuation","Over the past few years, the Russian economy has been exposed to many challenges, which include fluctuations in inflation and the exchange rate, as well as all possible sanctions from Western countries, and accordingly, a thorough analysis of the consequences of raising the key rate of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is relevant in the process of studying the impact of monetary policy on various sectors of the economy. The purpose of this study is to identify the key factors contributing to an increase in the key rate, and is aimed at assessing the impact of this growth on the business environment and the quality of life of society as a whole. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to consider the consequences of an increase in the rate for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as for consumer lending, with regard to the financial well-being of the population. The results of this analysis indicate that the positive dynamics of the key rate leads to an increase in the cost of loans, and consequently a decrease in the availability of borrowed funds and a reduction in consumer demand. Such consequences create additional difficulties for the business, leading to a revision of the financial and investment management strategy for the latter. This means that it is important not only to analyze the consequences, but also to offer recommendations for adapting to new conditions, and understanding these processes can become the basis for developing more effective solutions both at the level of an individual business and at the level of public policy. Thus, this study is aimed at updating issues related to changes in monetary policy and helping various economic participants adapt more quickly to new realities.",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W4405726365,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:  Abstract : This study sheds new light on the cross-sectional effects of inflation, which have substantial implications",,,,Goal 8,0.035896286,FALSE,

It examines the short- and long-window reaction to late filings, as well as how equity investors process statements accompanying late filing announcements, such as managers declaring intentions to file within/outside the SEC¡¯s allowed grace periods. This paper documents that delayed quarterly filings have distinctly different valuation implications than delayed annual filings over the short and long run, and that accounting problems play a unique role in signaling the seriousness of the delay. It also shows that investors do not accept management¡¯s delay-related assertions at face value, and that delayed filing announcements signal continued poor performance that is not fully reflected in stock prices at the time the announcements are made.

We show that this ¡°inflation gap¡± is linked with future rising inequality in the form of widening gaps in (a) health, (b) education, (c) home ownership, and (d) credit card debt, as well as in (e) a higher frequency of property crimes. We further provide an economic mechanism connecting inflation gap with rising inequality, empirically demonstrating the role of basic goods in reducing the ability of individuals in the low-income group to attain the social and economic outcomes that we study. In addition, we show a channel that connects the inflation gap to firms¡¯ profitability. Indeed, consistent with inflation gap disadvantaging low-income households and mainly through basic goods, inflation gap fluctuations are especially strongly connected to the profitability of firms operating in the energy and consumer staples sectors.

An alternative rendition, which we call <i>personalized data science</i> (Per-DS), aims to collect, analyze, and interpret <i>personal data</i> to inform <i>personal</i> decisions. This article describes the main features of Per-DS, and reviews its current state and future outlook. A Per-DS investigation is of, by, and for an individual, the Per-DS investigator, acting simultaneously as her own <i>investigator</i>, <i>study participant</i>, and <i>beneficiary</i>, and making <i>personalized</i> decisions for study design and implementation. The scope of Per-DS studies may include systematic monitoring of physiological or behavioral patterns, case-crossover studies for symptom triggers, pre-post trials for exposure-outcome relationships, and personalized (N-of-1) trials for effectiveness. Per-DS studies produce <i>personal knowledge</i> generalizable to the individual's future self (thus benefiting herself) rather than knowledge generalizable to an external population (thus benefiting others). This endeavor requires a pivot from <i>data mining</i> or <i>extraction</i> to <i>data gardening</i>, analogous to home gardeners producing food for home consumption-the Per-DS investigator needs to '<i>cultivate the field'</i> by setting goals, specifying study design, identifying necessary data elements, and assembling instruments and tools for data collection. Then, she can implement the study protocol, harvest her personal data, and <i>mine</i> the data to <i>extract</i> personal knowledge.

These experiments inform behavioral theories of operations management, impacting domains including inventory, supply chain management, queuing, forecasting, and sourcing. Yet, until now, the replicability of most behavioral insights from these laboratory experiments has been untested. We remedy this with the first large-scale replication study in operations management. With the input of the wider operations management community, we identify 10 prominent experimental operations management papers published in Management Science, which span a variety of domains, to be the focus of our replication effort. For each paper, we conduct a high-powered replication study of the main results across multiple locations using original materials (when available and suitable). In addition, our study tests replicability in multiple modalities (in-person and online) due to laboratory closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our replication study contributes new knowledge about the robustness of several key behavioral theories in operations management and contributes more broadly to efforts in the operations management field to improve research transparency and reliability.

Although research has compared and contrasted the two, we study how they compete with one another. In particular, we focus on how competition from traditional platforms affects volunteers¡¯ contributions to crowdsourced platforms. We propose a divergent effect: competition increases individual contributions from volunteers who were already active before the entry of any competitor (pre-entry contributors). However, competition also hinders recruitment and therefore leads to a decrease in total contributions from the set of volunteers who are new to the platform in a given time period (newly recruited contributors). We suggest the first effect is driven by pre-entry contributors¡¯ ideological attachment, whereas the second is driven by lower awareness of the platform postcompetitive entry. To test our theory, we leverage and examine how the phased entry of Google Maps in different countries affects contributions to OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced mapping platform. We find the hypothesized divergent effects and provide suggestive evidence of the underlying mechanisms. We contribute to research on crowdsourcing, volunteers¡¯ willingness to contribute, platform competition, and on the effect of competition on organizations more broadly.

Blood eosinophil counts are a biomarker with potential to be used in clinical practice, to help target ICS treatment with more precision in COPD patients with a history of exacerbations despite appropriate bronchodilator treatment. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 pharmacological treatment algorithms, based on the ABCD assessment, can be applied relatively easily to treatment-naive individuals at initial presentation. However, their use is more problematic during follow-up in patients who are already on maintenance treatment. There is a need for a different system to guide COPD pharmacological management during follow-up. Recent large randomised controlled trials have provided important new information concerning the therapeutic effects of ICSs and long-acting bronchodilators on exacerbations.

The shift in emphasis from questions about how well people perform to how they perform is certainly important (e.g., Hogarth, 1975). However, the usefulness of studying both questions together is nowhere more evident than in the study of heuristic rules and strategies. The reason for this is that the comparison of heuristic and normative rules allows one to examine discrepancies between actual and optimal behavior, which then raises questions regarding why such discrepancies exist. In this chapter, I focus on how one learns both types of rules from experience. The concern with learning from experience raises a number of issues that have not been adequately addressed; for example, Under what conditions are heuristics learned? How are they tested and maintained in the face of experience? Under what conditions do we fail to learn about the biases and mistakes that can result from their use?",OpenAlex(DOI),100,,https://openalex.org/W20147362,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:* The lead author was runner-up for the Hillel Einhorn award from the Society of Judgment and Decision Making,,,,Goal 17,0.009276319,FALSE,

We replicate this finding and provide a fundamentals-based perspective on why the materiality portfolio outperforms. Our basic premise is that changes in material ESG issues reflect fundamental firm characteristics. More financially established firms¡ªfirms with larger size, lower growth, and higher profitability relative to their sector¡ªare more likely to not only create material strengths but also resolve material weaknesses in their ESG scoring. This fundamental link dictates that one should comprehensively control for fundamental determinants of stock returns before attributing portfolio outperformance to improving material ESG scores. Indeed, we find that the materiality portfolio does not generate alpha after we account for its exposure to profitability and growth factors.

Patatoukas,Featured in The Atlantic .,,Featured in The Atlantic,"The implementation of any project requires clear thinking about the relative importance of stakeholders in achieving project outcomes. The Victorian Department of Primary Industries has a strong tradition in project planning. In our work, however, we found that few project teams looked systematically or strategically at the human and social capital resources required to deliver project goals. A literature search by the Practice Change Capacity Development Team revealed that many of the stakeholder analysis tools available focused on the target population for the project, not at the people resources required to implement the project. As a result we developed a stakeholder analysis tool better suited to project planning, which allows project teams to consider the important human and social capital resources required to improve project planning and implementation. The tool featured a 16 square matrix with two axes focussed on stakeholders who are: ? Influential ¨C stakeholders who have power over the organisation, or management of the project (x-axis), and ? Important ¨C stakeholders who have power over project implementation or outcome adoption (y-axis). Since its development, the Stakeholder Analysis Tool has been used by a number of teams, including Fisheries Victoria and the Victorian Serrated Tussock Working Party. Upon evaluation, participants expressed an improved team understanding of their project and its outcomes and a greater understanding of stakeholder management. We will report on case examples in which the Stakeholder Analysis Tool was used to meet different team objectives, while maintaining the tool¡¯s integrity. We will also explain how these studies have helped us revise and improve the tool. Three key learnings: ? Doing a stakeholder analysis as a team allows everyone to understand the importance and influence of the project¡¯s stakeholders. This helps the team to focus on project direction and success. ?

Every 3¨C4 years, the Royal College of Anaesthetists, as part of its National Audit Projects (NAP), performs a snapshot activity survey in all UK hospitals delivering anaesthesia, collecting patient©\level encounter data from all cases under the care of an anaesthetist. During November 2021, as part of NAP7, anaesthetists recorded details of all cases undertaken over 4 days at their site through an online survey capturing anonymous patient characteristics and anaesthetic details. Of 416 hospital sites invited to participate, 352 (85%) completed the activity survey. From these, 24,177 reports were returned, of which 24,172 (99%) were included in the final dataset. The work patterns by day of the week, time of day and surgical specialty were similar to previous NAP activity surveys. However, in non©\obstetric patients, between NAP5 (2013) and NAP7 (2021) activity surveys, the estimated median age of patients increased by 2.3 years from median (IQR) of 50.5 (28.4¨C69.1) to 52.8 (32.1¨C69.2) years.

Some changes may reflect the impact of the COVID©\19 pandemic on the anaesthetic population, though patients with confirmed COVID©\19 accounted for only 149 (1%) cases.

The airlift planning problem faced by the air component of USTRANSCOM is to decide how requirements (passengers and cargo) will be assigned to the available aircraft fleet and the sequence of pickups and drop-offs that each aircraft will perform to ensure that the requirements are delivered with minimal delay and with maximum utilization of the available aircraft. This problem is of significant interest to USTRANSCOM because of the highly time-sensitive nature of the requirements that are typically designated for delivery by airlift, as well as the very high cost of airlift operations. At the same time, the airlift planning problem is extremely difficult to solve because of the combinatorial nature of the problem and the numerous constraints present in the problem (such as weight restrictions and crew rest requirements). In this paper, we propose an approach for solving the airlift planning problem faced by USTRANSCOM based on modern, large-scale optimization. Our approach relies on solving a large-scale mixed-integer programming model that disentangles the assignment decision (which aircraft will pickup and deliver which requirement) from the sequencing decision (in what order the aircraft will pickup and deliver its assigned requirements), using a combination of heuristics and column generation. Through computational experiments with both a simulated data set and a planning data set provided by USTRANSCOM, we show that our approach leads to high-quality solutions for realistic instances (e.g., 100 aircraft and 100 requirements) within operationally feasible time frames.

Forthcoming in Operations Research .",2016,Robust product line design,"The majority of approaches to product line design that have been proposed by marketing scientists assume that the underlying choice model that describes how the customer population will respond to a new product line is known precisely. In reality, however, marketers do not precisely know how the customer population will respond and can only obtain an estimate of the choice model from limited conjoint data. In this paper, we propose a new type of optimization approach for product line design under uncertainty. Our approach is based on the paradigm of robust optimization where, rather than optimizing the expected revenue with respect to a single model, one optimizes the worst-case expected revenue with respect to an uncertainty set of models. This framework allows us to account for parameter uncertainty, when we may be confident about the type of model structure but not about the values of the parameters, and structural uncertainty, when we may not even be confident about the right model structure to use to describe the customer population. Through computational experiments with a real conjoint data set, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach in addressing parameter and structural uncertainty. With regard to parameter uncertainty, we show that product lines designed without accounting for parameter uncertainty are fragile and can experience worst-case revenue losses as high as 23%, and that the robust product line can significantly outperform the nominal product line in the worst case, with relative improvements of up to 14%. With regard to structural uncertainty, we similarly show that product lines that are designed for a single model structure can be highly suboptimal under other structures (worst-case losses of up to 37%), while a product line that optimizes against the worst of a set of structurally distinct models can outperform single model product lines by as much as 55% in the worst case and can guarantee good aggregate performance over structurally distinct models.",Crossref,88.46153846,10.1287/opre.2016.1546,https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1546,2017,Operations Research,ok,"CR-biblio:Robust product line design.

In this paper, we propose an approximate solution approach to decomposable MDPs that is based on re-solving a fluid linear optimization formulation of the problem at each decision epoch. This formulation tractably approximates the problem by modeling transition behavior at the level of the individual components rather than the complete system. We prove that our fluid formulation provides a tighter bound on the optimal value function than three state-of-the-art formulations: the approximate linear optimization formulation, the classical Lagrangian relaxation formulation, and a novel, alternate Lagrangian relaxation that is based on relaxing an action consistency constraint.

We use this technique to estimate the utility functions of players in a game from their observed actions and to estimate the congestion function on a road network from traffic count data. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that it supports both parametric and nonparametric estimation by leveraging ideas from statistical learning (kernel methods and regularization operators).

Our analysis provides a useful framework to understand the interaction between a firm's choice of product reusability and the possibility of supply disruptions. First, we establish a threshold refurbishment policy: the firm refurbishes more as reusability increases but avoids refurbishment at low reusability. When both consumer valuation of used units and supply disruption probability are high, the firm builds a safety-stock of traded-in units, which it refrains from refurbishing when there is no supply disruption, unless the product reusability level is sufficiently high. Second, we find that it benefits to increase product reusability as the supply disruption risk increases until a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold, it is advantageous for the firm to reduce reusability and save on design costs to be profitable, contrary to popular belief. Our numerical examples reveal that the firm reduces reusability when production cost is high due to narrow margins. Finally, we demonstrate that the firm shares the benefits of higher product reusability with its consumers through higher trade-in fees and lower refurbished unit prices. This results in a ¡°Pareto-efficient¡± win for the firm, its trade-in customers, and purchasers of refurbished units.

Published predictors require information only available at the moment of discharge. The authors hypothesized that machine learning approaches can be leveraged to accurately predict readmissions in postoperative patients from the emergency department. Further, the authors hypothesize that these approaches can accurately predict the risk of readmission much sooner than hospital discharge. Methods Using a cohort of surgical patients at a tertiary care academic medical center, surgical, demographic, lab, medication, care team, and current procedural terminology data were extracted from the electronic health record. The primary outcome was whether there existed a future hospital readmission originating from the emergency department within 30 days of surgery. Secondarily, the time interval from surgery to the prediction was analyzed at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h. Different machine learning models for predicting the primary outcome were evaluated with respect to the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve metric using different permutations of the available features. Results Surgical hospital admissions (N = 34,532) from April 2013 to December 2016 were included in the analysis. Surgical and demographic features led to moderate discrimination for prediction after discharge (area under the curve: 0.74 to 0.76), whereas medication, consulting team, and current procedural terminology features did not improve the discrimination. Lab features improved discrimination, with gradient-boosted trees attaining the best performance (area under the curve: 0.866, SD 0.006). This performance was sustained during temporal validation with 2017 to 2018 data (area under the curve: 0.85 to 0.88). Lastly, the discrimination of the predictions calculated 36 h after surgery (area under the curve: 0.88 to 0.89) nearly matched those from time of discharge. Conclusions A machine learning approach to predicting postoperative readmission can produce hospital-specific models for accurately predicting 30-day readmissions via the emergency department. Moreover, these predictions can be confidently calculated at 36 h after surgery without consideration of discharge-level data.

To address this problem, we develop a two-stage, mixed-integer stochastic dynamic programming model with recourse. The first stage allocates these resources across multiple surgeries with uncertain durations and prescribes the sequence of surgeries to these resources. The second stage determines actual start times to surgeries based on realized durations of preceding surgeries and assigns overtime to resources to ensure all surgeries are completed using the allocation and sequence determined in the first stage. We develop a data-driven robust optimization method that solves large-scale real-sized versions of this model close to optimality. We validate and implement this model as a decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. This system effectively incorporates the flexibility in the resources and uncertainty in surgical durations, and explicitly trades off resource usage and overtime costs. This has increased the average daily utilization of the anesthesiologists by 3.5% and of the operating rooms by 3.8%. This has led to an average daily cost savings of around 7% or estimated to be $2.2 million on an annual basis.

In preparation.",,"Disintermediation in Online Platforms: Price and Reputation Effects, with Shreyas Sekar","Online platforms that rely on commission fees are vulnerable to disintermediation, where buyers and sellers transact off-platform to avoid fees. This phenomenon can significantly reduce platform revenue and, in extreme cases, threaten the platform's viability. For sellers, disintermediation involves giving up the platform's protections against risky buyers (e.g., payment delays or fraud). Sellers must therefore weigh the benefits of avoiding commissions against exposure to potentially risky buyers, with their decision primarily influenced by the quality (or accuracy) of buyer information provided by the platform (e.g., through a reputation system). This paper examines how the threat of disintermediation impacts the platform's optimal pricing strategy, revenue, and information quality. In our model, sellers transact with buyers either on the platform - for a fixed commission - or bypass the platform completely and negotiate an off-platform price. Buyer types are private information; in particular, ""risky"" buyers impose higher transaction costs on sellers in both channels, and additionally withhold payment in the offline channel. To capture information quality, we assume the platform has a technology that generates, with varying degrees of accuracy, a noisy signal of the buyer's type. Our results are summarized as follows. First, in the absence of the offline channel, platform revenue weakly increases in information quality under any fixed commission rate as established in previous works. However, the threat of disintermediation can reverse this effect---the presence of the offline channel can make platform revenue strictly decrease in information quality, due to sellers' improved ability to screen risky buyers. Second, one might assume naively that the prospect of disintermediation would compel the platform to lower its commission rate. In some cases, however, it may be in the platform's interest to ""double down"" and increase its commission rate in response to users transacting offline. Third, although charging sellers upfront to access the platform is robust to disintermediation, this strategy can fall short of the revenue attainable under commissions. This suggests that upfront pricing alone cannot fully recoup revenue losses from disintermediation. Conventional wisdom suggests that an open and information-rich environment can boost on-platform transactions by fostering trust. Our work adds nuance to this view by showing how high information quality can hurt the platform by encouraging buyers and sellers to disintermediate, and in the process alter the platform's pricing strategy.

In this setting, a key input to the principal¡¯s optimal contracting problem is the agent¡¯s production function: the dependence of agent output on effort. Although agent production is classically assumed to be known to the principal, this is unlikely to be the case in practice. Motivated by the design of performance-based incentives, we present a method for estimating a principal-agent model from data on incentive contracts and associated outcomes, with a focus on estimating agent production. The proposed estimator is statistically consistent and can be expressed as a mathematical program. To circumvent computational challenges with solving the estimation problem exactly, we approximate it as an integer program, which we solve through a column generation algorithm that uses hypothesis tests to select variables. We show that our approximation scheme and solution technique both preserve the estimator¡¯s consistency and combine to dramatically reduce the computational time required to obtain sound estimates. To demonstrate our method, we conducted an experiment on a crowdwork platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk) by randomly assigning incentive contracts with varying pay rates among a pool of workers completing the same task. We present numerical results illustrating how our estimator combined with experimentation can shed light on the efficacy of performance-based incentives.

In response, many domestic suppliers pivoted to producing PPE, such as masks and face shields, made possible by low material costs and simple designs. A key challenge that remained was the lack of an established marketplace for nontraditional suppliers of PPE to connect with healthcare facilities in need. To address this inefficiency, we launched an online platform, Shield-Net, to match requests for face shields with new suppliers of PPE. Our platform was based on an optimization model that produced supplier-requester pairs and took into account request urgency, request size, production capacity, location, and product type. During the period of March to September 2020, Shield-Net produced 390 matches, resulting in the shipment of more than 50,000 face shields to 68 unique requesting organizations.

To entice commuters to travel by public transit instead of driving personal vehicles, municipal governments must address the ¡°last-mile¡± problem by providing convenient and affordable transportation between a commuter¡¯s home and a transit station. This challenge raises an important question: Is there a cost-effective mechanism that can improve public transit adoption by solving the last-mile problem? Academic/practical relevance: In this paper, we present and analyze two incentive mechanisms for increasing commuter adoption of public transit. In a direct mechanism, the government provides a subsidy to commuters who adopt a ¡°mixed mode,¡± which involves combining public transit with hailing rides to/from a transit station. The government funds the subsidy by imposing congestion fees on personal vehicles entering the city center. In an indirect mechanism, instead of levying congestion fees, the government secures funding for the subsidy from the private sector. We examine the implications of both mechanisms on relevant stakeholders. These two mechanisms are especially relevant because several jurisdictions in the United States have begun piloting incentive programs, in which commuters receive subsidies for ride-hailing trips that begin or end at a transit station. Methodology: We present a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions among five self-interested stakeholders (commuters, public transit agency, ride-hailing platform, municipal government, and local private enterprises). Results: By examining equilibrium outcomes, we obtain three key findings. First, we characterize how the optimal interventions associated with the direct or the indirect mechanism depend on: (a) the coverage level of the public transit network; (b) the public transit adoption target; and (c) the relative strength of commuter preferences between driving and taking public transit. Second, we show that the direct mechanism cannot be budget-neutral without undermining commuter welfare. However, when the public transit adoption target is not too aggressive, we find that the indirect mechanism can increase both commuter welfare and sales to the private-sector partner while remaining budget-neutral. Finally, we show that, although the indirect mechanism restricts the scope of government intervention (by eliminating the congestion fee), it can dominate the direct mechanism by leaving all stakeholders better off, especially when the adoption target is modest.

[PDF]",2019,"Data-Driven Incentive Design in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, with Anil Aswani and Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen","The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) was created under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to control escalating Medicare spending by incentivizing providers to deliver healthcare more efficiently. Providers that enroll in the MSSP earn bonus payments for reducing spending to below a risk-adjusted financial benchmark that depends on the provider's historical spending. To generate savings, a provider must invest to improve efficiency, which is a cost that is absorbed entirely by the provider under the current contract. This has proven to be challenging for the MSSP, with a majority of participating providers unable to generate savings due to the associated costs. In this paper, we formulate the MSSP as a principal-agent model and take a data-driven approach to redesigning the MSSP contract. We propose a new type of contract that includes a performance-based subsidy that partially reimburses the provider's investment. We prove that there exists a subsidized contract that dominates the current MSSP contract by producing a strictly higher expected payoff for both Medicare and the provider. We then present a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the parameters of the principal-agent model, using a dataset containing the financial performance of providers enrolled in the MSSP. Based on the estimated model, we find that introducing performance-based subsidies to the MSSP can increase Medicare savings and provider payments over the current contract by 24% and 21%, respectively. Our estimation also reveals that providers with high benchmarks are more likely to generate savings and receive bonus payments, suggesting that the existing MSSP contract may be inadvertently penalizing historically efficient providers through the assignment of lower financial benchmarks.",Semantic Scholar,93.65079365,10.2139/ssrn.2808211,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72810e4f467ef0217eb2c366f628f6e18956c874,2018,Operational Research,ok,"CR-biblio:Data-Driven Incentive Design in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, with Anil Aswani and Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen.

We first provide a formulation for inverse optimization and prove it to be NP-hard. In contrast to existing methods, we show that the parameter estimates produced by our formulation are statistically consistent. Our approach involves combining a new duality-based reformulation for bilevel programs with a regularization scheme that smooths discontinuities in the formulation. Using epi-convergence theory, we show the regularization parameter can be adjusted to approximate the original inverse optimization problem to arbitrary accuracy, which we use to prove our consistency results. Next, we propose two solution algorithms based on our duality-based formulation. The first is an enumeration algorithm that is applicable to settings where the dimensionality of the parameter space is modest, and the second is a semiparametric approach that combines nonparametric statistics with a modified version of our formulation. These numerical algorithms are shown to maintain the statistical consistency of the underlying formulation.

Successful treatment of cardiac arrest is extremely time sensitive, and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) where possible significantly increases the probability of survival. Placement of AEDs in public locations can improve survival by enabling bystanders to treat victims of cardiac arrest prior to the arrival of emergency medical responders, thus shortening the time between collapse and treatment. However, since the exact locations of future cardiac arrests cannot be known a priori, AEDs must be placed strategically in public locations to ensure their accessibility in the event of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest emergency. In this paper, we propose a data-driven optimization model for deploying AEDs in public spaces while accounting for uncertainty in future cardiac arrest locations. Our approach involves discretizing a continuous service area into a large set of scenarios, where the probability of cardiac arrest at each location is itself uncertain. We model uncertainty in the spatial risk of cardiac arrest using a polyhedral uncertainty set that we calibrate using historical cardiac arrest data. We propose a solution technique based on row-and-column generation that exploits the structure of the uncertainty set, allowing the algorithm to scale gracefully with the total number of scenarios. Using real cardiac arrest data from the City of Toronto, we conduct an extensive numerical study on AED deployment public locations. We find that hedging against cardiac arrest location uncertainty can produce AED deployments that outperform an intuitive sample average approximation by 9%¨C15% and cuts the performance gap with respect to an ex post model by half. Our findings suggest that accounting for cardiac arrest location uncertainty can lead to improved accessibility of AEDs during cardiac arrest emergencies and the potential for improved survival outcomes.

EVs are particularly intriguing due to their relatively high abundance in most biofluids, with the potential to identify specific cargo derived from circulating tumor EVs. Moreover, normal cells in lymph nodes can uptake EVs, fostering a pre-metastatic microenvironment that facilitates lymph node metastases - a common occurrence in oral cancers. This review encompasses English language publications over the last twenty years, focusing on methods for isolating EVs from saliva, blood, and lymphatic fluids, as well as the collection methods employed. Seventeen cases met the inclusion criteria according to ISEV guidelines, including 10 saliva cases, 6 blood cases, and 1 lymphatic fluid case. This review also highlighted research gaps in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) EVs, including a lack of multi-omics studies and the exploration of potential EV markers for drug resistance, as well as a notable underutilization of microfluidic technologies to translate liquid biopsy EV findings into clinical applications.",Semantic Scholar,8.24742268,10.20517/evcna.2024.29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e41174a43a0c89a3566140ef265ac3487203557,2024,Extracellular Vesicles and Circulating Nucleic Acids,ok,"CR-biblio:Chen  Chen, YK",,10.20517/evcna.2024.29,,Goal 9,0.009641423,FALSE,

First the Butcher group from numerical integration on Euclidean spaces and the -group of an operad naturally admit a pre-group structure. Next a relative Rota¨CBaxter operator on a group naturally splits the group structure to a post-group structure. Conversely, a post-group gives rise to a relative Rota¨CBaxter operator on the sub-adjacent group. Further a post-group gives a braided group and a solution of the Yang¨CBaxter equation. Indeed the category of post-groups is isomorphic to the category of braided groups and the category of skew-left braces. Moreover a post-Lie group differentiates to a post-Lie algebra structure on the vector space of left invariant vector fields, showing that post-Lie groups are the integral objects of post-Lie algebras. Finally, post-Hopf algebras and post-Lie Magnus expansions are utilized to study the formal integration of post-Lie algebras. As a byproduct, a post-group structure is explicitly determined on the Lie¨CButcher group from numerical integration on manifolds.",Semantic Scholar,16.90140845,10.1007/s00208-023-02592-z,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6abfc14f173bbdcfb59fea954c7f75646e167cc9,2023,Mathematische Annalen,ok,"CR-biblio:Bai  , Tang, C",,10.1007/s00208-023-02592-z,,Goal 12,0.011667256,FALSE,

In this paper, we present MapTRansformer, an end-to-end framework for online vectorized HD map construction. We propose a unified permutation-equivalent modeling approach, i.e., modeling map element as a point set with a group of equivalent permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element and stabilizes the learning process. We design a hierarchical query embedding scheme to flexibly encode structured map information and perform hierarchical bipartite matching for map element learning. To speed up convergence, we further introduce auxiliary one-to-many matching and dense supervision. The proposed method well copes with various map elements with arbitrary shapes. It runs at real-time inference speed and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Abundant qualitative results show stable and robust map construction quality in complex and various driving scenes.
