Journal of Finance , forthcoming",,Rent or Buy? Inflation Experiences and Homeownership within and across Countries with Ulrike Malmendier,"ABSTRACT We show that past inflation experiences strongly predict homeownership within and across countries. First, we collect novel survey data, which reveal inflation protection to be a key motivation for homeownership, especially after high inflation experiences. Second, using household data from 22 European countries, we find that higher exposure to historical inflation predicts higher homeownership rates. We estimate similar associations among immigrants to the United States who experienced different past inflation in their home countries but face the same U.S. housing market. Consistent with the experience effects model, the relationship is strongest in countries with predominantly fixed©\rate mortgages.",Crossref,100,10.1111/jofi.13332,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13332,2024,The Journal of Finance,ok,CR-biblio:Rent or Buy?

infections (HCAI). The present study was an attempt to determine the real 
knowledge and practices of healthcare professionals of pediatric emergency care 
unit in Benin. Methods: This was a three-month observational study. 
First a trained interviewer observed both the premises and the healthcare 
professionals during their administering treatment, without their knowledge. 
Second, their level of knowledge about HCAI was examined using a 
self-administered questionnaire. Finally, bacteria were cultured/measured from 
their hands before and after hand-washing through swab samples. Outcome: The 
modes of microorganism transmission were poorly known (21.6%), but knowledge 
about the 5 moments for hand hygiene was satisfactory (84.1%). Hand hygiene 
adherence rate was 6.9% in the study population. Simple hand-washing was 
prevalent (82%). The healthcare professionals did not adhere to 
the recommended duration for hand-washing. The required hand-washing equipment 
was inadequate, and alcohol-based handrub dispenser was unavailable. 
Microorganism isolated from healthcare professionals before hand-washing 
included Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter Cloacae. After hand-washing, the 
transient flora decreased. Conclusion: Hand hygiene adherence rate is 
low in the study population. An immediate action is required to improve 
observance of hand-washing. This may include: training healthcare professionals, 
displaying visual behavior reminder posters, providing alcohol-based handrub.",Semantic Scholar,54.01459854,10.4236/ojped.2020.104070,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/043da4da825a95a3a83f0bfafdf20420bb62e49f,2020,,ok,"CR-biblio:Simple Actions, Complex Habits: Lessons from Hospital Hand Hygiene",,10.4236/ojped.2020.104070,,Goal 3,0.011079638,FALSE,

In a series of experiments, we test these predictions by measuring performance and preferences for payoff-equivalent gain and loss contracts. We find that people indeed work harder under loss than gain contracts, as the theory predicts. Surprisingly, rather than a preference for the gain contract, we find that people actually prefer loss contracts.

Methods: This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was conducted that included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Findings: Between 2 February 2021 and 29 December 2021, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 hours recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 513 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.98; p=0.026). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of 8 previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths) in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.45-0.72). Including the results from RECOVERY into an updated meta-analysis of all 9 completed trials (involving 11,888 randomised patients and 1484 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.71-0.89; p<0.001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes. Interpretation: In patients hospitalised for COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials.

Drawing on a longitudinal dataset of college students before and during the pandemic, we document dramatic changes in physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. We show that biometric and time-use data are critical for understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19, as the pandemic has tightened the link between lifestyle behaviors and depression. Our findings also suggest a puzzle: Disruptions to physical activity and mental health are strongly associated, but restoration of physical activity through a short-term intervention does not help improve mental health. These results highlight the large impact of COVID-19 on both lifestyle and well-being and offer directions for interventions aimed at restoring mental health. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=682), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 10,000 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by 25 to 30 min per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 min, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 h per day.

These conversions have drawn public scrutiny and triggered a debate about the implications of ownership conversions on nursing home performance. Exploring a nationwide panel data set of U.S. nursing homes from 2006 to 2017, we observe that nursing homes with higher financial distress are associated with higher likelihood of NP-to-FP conversions. The postconversion operating margins increased significantly. Converted nursing homes improved their financial performance by reducing operating costs while keeping net resident revenues unchanged. Both cutting registered nurse staffing and cutting overhead staffing contributed to reductions in operating costs; however, only the former cost-reduction measure had a negative impact on quality. On average, the postconversion quality of care declined. The effects of NP-to-FP conversions on nursing homes were moderated by preconversion financial distress: High-distress nursing homes aggressively cut registered nurse staffing and experienced severe quality decline, whereas low-distress ones kept registered nurse staffing unchanged and largely avoided quality decline. These findings lead to both policy and managerial insights. To nursing home regulators, we recommend increased oversight on NP-to-FP conversions of nursing homes with high preconversion financial distress. To managers of nursing homes undergoing NP-to-FP conversions, our findings suggest that although cost reduction is an effective strategy to improve financial performance, they need to avoid the pitfall of cutting registered nurse staffing and instead focus on streamlining overhead operations in order to increase operating efficiency without compromising quality.

A major challenge in burst-denoising is in coping with pixel misalignment, which was so far handled with rather simplistic assumptions of simple motion, or the ability to align in pre-processing. Such assumptions are not realistic in the presence of large motion and high levels of noise. We show that Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), originally suggested for physics-based novel-view rendering, can serve as a powerful framework for burst denoising. NeRFs have an inherent capability of handling noise as they integrate information from multiple images, but they are limited in doing so, mainly since they build on pixel-wise operations which are suitable to ideal imaging conditions. Our approach, termed NAN111Refer to the project website: noise-aware-nerf.github.io, leverages inter-view and spatial information in NeRFs to better deal with noise. It achieves state-of-the-art results in burst denoising and is especially successful in coping with large movement and occlusions, under very high levels of noise. With the rapid advances in accelerating NeRFs, it could provide a powerful platform for denoising in challenging environments.",Semantic Scholar,8.888888889,10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01234,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27622ab8eafe2aa886b4398c07456ca1e6074b6a,2022,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,ok,CR-biblio:nan,,10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01234,,Goal 9,0.008572508,FALSE,

Describing the observed galaxy spectral energy distributions in detail now requires physical models with a large number of highly correlated parameters.

We confirm that the revenue©\sharing contract can coordinate supply chain decisions including the innovation investment, whereas the other two contracts may result in underinvestment in innovation. However, the downstream manufacturer does not always prefer the revenue©\sharing contract; the manufacturer's profit can be higher with a quality©\dependent wholesale price contract than with a revenue©\sharing contract, specifically when the upstream supplier's innovation cost is low. We then extend our model to incorporate upstream competition between suppliers. By inviting upstream competition, with the wholesale price contract, the manufacturer can increase his profit substantially. Furthermore, under upstream competition, the revenue©\sharing contract coordinates the supply chain, and results in an optimal contract form for the manufacturer when suppliers are symmetric. We also analyze the case of complementary components suppliers, and show that most of our results are robust.",Crossref,93.33333333,10.1111/poms.12218,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12218,2015,Production and Operations Management,ok,"CR-biblio:Wang, J. and H.

This report provides prevalence estimates of adult obesity and severe obesity during August 2021-August 2023 by age and sex, as well as obesity prevalence by education level. Trends in the prevalence of adult obesity and severe obesity over the previous 10 years are also shown.


Methods
Data from the August 2021-August 2023 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used for prevalence estimates, incorporating examination survey sample weights into the analysis and accounting for the survey's complex, multistage probability design. Measured height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) to define obesity (BMI at or above 30) and severe obesity (BMI at or above 40). Differences between estimates overall, among subgroups, and compared with 2017-March 2020 were evaluated using t tests at the 0.05 level. Data from four NHANES cycles (2013-2014, 2015-2016, 2017-March 2020, and August 2021-August 2023) were used to assess 10-year trends. Polynomial regression was used to test the significance of linear and nonlinear 10-year trends, accounting for the unequal spacing and lengths of survey cycles.


Key findings
During August 2021-August 2023, the prevalence of obesity in adults was 40.3%, with no significant differences between men and women. Obesity prevalence was higher in adults ages 40-59 than in ages 20-39 and 60 and older. The prevalence of obesity was lower in adults with a bachelor's degree or more than in adults with less education. The prevalence of severe obesity in adults was 9.4% and was higher in women than men for each age group.

Existing studies have introduced various unlearning objectives to pursue LLM unlearning without necessitating complete retraining. However, each of these objectives has unique properties, and no unified framework is currently available to comprehend them thoroughly. To fill the gap, we propose a toolkit of the gradient effect (G-effect), quantifying the impacts of unlearning objectives on model performance from a gradient perspective. A notable advantage is its broad ability to detail the unlearning impacts from various aspects across instances, updating steps, and LLM layers. Accordingly, the G-effect offers new insights into identifying drawbacks of existing unlearning objectives, further motivating us to explore a series of new solutions for their mitigation and improvements.

Further, this effect reverses at the beginning of the year, consistent with the temporary nature of price manipulation. We show that hedge funds¡¯ portfolios are closely related to market-wide short interest, suggesting that hedge funds, with their convex compensation structures, may generate the patterns we observe.

Finally, we provide evidence of mutual funds and short sellers avoiding each other, and we show that downward pressure by short sellers is outweighed by upward pressure by buyers.

In our model, both a monopolist (strategic) informed trader and uninformed traders consider the impact of their demands on prices. In contrast to settings with price-taking traders, private information never eliminates a priced risk, and can lead to higher risk premiums. Also unlike settings with price-taking informed traders, risk premiums decrease in response to an increase in liquidity-motivated trades in diversified portfolios. These differing effects arise because a privately informed strategic trader conceals her trades by taking small positions relative to the magnitude of noise trades. Although prices partially reveal her information and reduce uncertainty, a concomitant decrease in her risk absorption dominates and leads to higher risk premiums. Similar to settings with price-taking traders, private information affects expected returns only via factor loadings and risk premiums on existing payoff risks¡ªit introduces no new priced risks, and factor loadings (betas) explain all cross-sectional differences in expected returns.",Crossref,83.63636364,10.2308/accr-51026,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51026,2015,The Accounting Review,ok,"CR-biblio:__trategic Informed Trades, Diversification, and Expected Returns,_ (with Judson Caskey and John S.

Previous chapters have demonstrated that low interest rates can lead to rising house and stock prices. Since real estate and stocks are predominantly owned by the wealthy, rising asset prices disproportionately benefit already affluent households, thereby exacerbating inequality. An intriguing aspect discussed in this chapter is the reciprocal relationship between inequality and interest rates. As inequality rises, with more wealth concentrated among the rich, overall savings in the economy tend to increase, which can, in turn, suppress interest rates. Thus, interest rates and inequality are deeply intertwined.",Crossref,80,10.1093/9780198946410.003.0009,https://doi.org/10.1093/9780198946410.003.0009,2025,How Low Interest Rates Change the World,ok,"CR-biblio:__re Low Natural Interest Rates the New Normal,_ with Zheng Liu and Jingyi Zhang.",Inequality and Low Interest Rates,10.1093/9780198946410.003.0009,,Goal 10,0.19915218,TRUE,economic inequality; income inequality

Two large-scale field experiments (total N = 73,010) in the context of print-at-home coupons show that framing a savings message as affecting a beneficiary (i.e., ¡°save for X¡±) increases coupon printing and redemptions. This beneficiary framing effect is equivalent to an incremental $0.05 (3.4%) of coupon value. We report eight additional studies (total N = 3,052) to investigate the mechanism, replicability, and role of salience. We find evidence supporting a mental accounting explanation: participants with beneficiary-related budget categories rate beneficiary-framed coupons as more account-relevant and more valuable than non-beneficiary-framed coupons. The experiments further suggest that the beneficiary framing effect (i) holds across multiple common budgeting domains, (ii) cannot be fully explained by an affect transfer mechanism, (iii) is not solely attributable to the visual salience of the beneficiary framing treatment, and (iv) exhibits a boundary condition in which beneficiary framing may reduce promotion response when the recipient does not have a relevant beneficiary.

[ Abstract ]",2018,"""Engaging Voluntary Contributions in Online Communities: A Hidden Markov Model,"" by W","User contribution is critical to online communities but also difficult to sustain given its public goods nature. This paper studies the design of IT artifacts to motivate voluntary contributions in online communities. We propose a dynamic approach, which allows the effect of motivating mechanisms to change across users over time. We characterize the dynamics of user contributions using a hidden Markov model (HMM) with latent motivation states under the public goods framework. We focus on three motivating mechanisms on transitioning users between the latent states: reciprocity, peer recognition, and self-image. Based on Bayesian estimation of the model with user-level panel data, we identify three motivation states (low, medium, and high), and show that the motivating mechanisms, implemented through various IT artifacts, could work differently across states. Specifically, reciprocity is only effective to transition users from low to medium motivation state, whereas peer recognition can boost all users to higher states. And self-image shows no effect when a user is already in high motivation state, although it helps users in low and medium states move to the high state. Design simulations on our structural model provide additional insights into the consequences of changing specific IT artifacts. These findings offer implications for platform designers on how to motivate user contributions and build sustainable online communities.",Crossref,94.47852761,10.25300/misq/2018/14196,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2018/14196,2018,MIS Quarterly,ok,"CR-biblio:""Engaging Voluntary Contributions in Online Communities: A Hidden Markov Model,"" by W.

[ Abstract ]",2021,"__ompetition among Proprietary and Open-Source Software Firms: The Role of Licensing on Strategic Contribution,_ by T","In enterprise software markets, firms are increasingly using services-based business models built on open-source software (OSS) to compete with established, proprietary software firms. Because third-party firms can also strategically contribute to OSS and compete in the services market, the nature of competition between OSS constituents and proprietary software firms can be complex. Moreover, their incentives are likely influenced by the licensing schemes that govern OSS. We study a three-player game and examine how open-source licensing affects competition among an open-source originator, an open-source contributor, and a proprietor competing in an enterprise software market. In this regard, we examine (1) how quality investments and prices are endogenously determined in equilibrium, (2) how license restrictiveness impacts equilibrium investments and the quality of offerings, and (3) how license restrictiveness affects consumer surplus and social welfare. Although some in the open-source community often advocate restrictive licenses such as the GNU General Public License because it is not always in the best interest of the originator for the contributor to invest greater development effort, such licensing can actually be detrimental to both consumer surplus and social welfare when it exacerbates this incentive conflict. We find such an outcome in markets characterized by software providers with similar development capabilities yet cast in favor of the proprietor. In contrast, when these capabilities either become more dispersed or remain similar but tilt in favor of open source, a more restrictive license instead encourages greater effort from the OSS contributor, leads to higher OSS quality, and provides a larger societal benefit.

Our first contact with Dr Kaplan occurred via his single-authored textbook Clinical Hypertension in its third edition in 1983, published by Williams and Wilikins. Norman went on to write 8 more editions over his >60 year career in high blood pressure care and education. Many a student of the pathophysiology, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension was weaned on his pioneering textbook. Some of our dearest memories of Norman came from his participation in the American Heart Association Hypertension Summer School Programs, which he graciously attended in most, if not all years, over several decades. The Hypertension Summer School was a setting in which 60 to 100 students would camp out for 4 days with about 20 faculty during which we would teach, discuss, and philosophize about hypertension literally from dawn to dusk. Norman was a master at this. The Hypertension Summer School environment brought out the educator and more importantly the consummate ¡°teacher¡± in Norman. His signature approach to education was characterized by a combination of a thorough knowledge of the field, a direct no-nonsense approach to the lecture, and sprinkled on top of that a healthy dose of Texas humor. One vivid example of his humor was when he spontaneously and seemingly by magic produced an aneroid blood pressure measuring device and stethoscope and took a student¡¯s blood pressure and, while doing everything wrong, proudly exclaimed, ¡°this is why a physician should NEVER take a blood pressure!¡± The hypertension literature is punctuated by a large number of Kaplan submissions. Norman had an interesting way of titling some of his opinion pieces. His huge reputation in the field of hypertension made him a much sought after opinion leader, writing articles with titles like ¡°Recent clinical trials: the good, the bad, and the misleading¡±1 ¡°Bashing booze: The danger of losing the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption,¡± and ¡°Critical comments on recent literature. SCRAAPHY about MAPHY from HAPPHY.¡± One favorite ¡°Kaplan pearl¡± was his approach to a patient with urgent hypertension and anxiety in the clinic. He would describe a relatively young patient with elevated blood pressure, in the midst of what sounded like a panic attack, ¡°losing it¡± in his clinic at Parkland Hospital. His therapy was not a dose of clonidineor a bite-and-swallow capsule of Procardia. Instead, he would reach into a pocket, extract a paper bag, and hand it to the patient with instructions to breathe into this medical device until he returned in a few minutes to recheck the individuals blood pressure. Although we (RRT, DDP) are about a decade too young to have witnessed these, the debates between Norman Kaplan (whose training was in endocrinology) and Jerome Conn from Michigan over the prevalence of aldosterone excess in the 1960s were, from what we are told, genuine events. And, here we are in 2020, still undertaking research on the role of aldosterone excess in hypertension nearly 60 years later. We were, however, old enough and privileged to witness his many questions, discussions, and debates at premier hypertension and cardiovascular meetings including the original ¡°Cleveland¡± meetings of the now AHA Council on Hypertension and the American Heart Association National Meetings, among others. As Professor Ram details elsewhere in this tribute, we all (we believe) shamelessly copied figures and tables out of Clinical Hypertension, frequently onto transparencies for use on an overhead projector and subsequently on 35 mm projector slides in the era before Powerpoint. There just was not any other source so full of key information in the field of high blood pressure. Norman also contributed sections to UpToDate and the PIER Annals of Internal Medicine medical education component of the American College of Physicians, again providing practitioners with the wisdom of decades of clinical care and an encyclopedic knowledge of the hypertension literature. I (RRT) was fortunate enough to succeed him in both endeavors, literally standing on the shoulders of a giant. His legacy is soundly established, and he will be deeply missed by his family, those related by blood, and the larger family of those blessed by the heritage of a lifetime dedicated to the mission of hypertension research and clinical care that he has left to all of us.",Semantic Scholar,40.54054054,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15234,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f26e61f3d910d4e761b529b067c758dd5d815470,2020,HYPERTENSION,ok,"CR-biblio:Changing Design Education for the 21st Century , She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation, 6.1 (2020) (w",,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15234,,Goal 4,0.052104367,TRUE,teachers

 In cardiac rehabilitation, technological innovations can improve patient-relevant outcomes and are associated with reductions in health care costs by enabling personalized care. Lifestyle factors such as physical fitness, dietary habits, mental stress, and sleep quality, are strong predictors of the occurrence, clinical course, and overall treatment outcomes of common cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. However, these lifestyle factors are rarely monitored, nor used in daily clinical practice and personalized cardiac care. Moreover, non-adherence to long-term self-reporting is common.
 
 
 
 The main purpose of this study is to evaluate adherence to a continuous unobtrusive and patient-friendly lifestyle monitoring system.
 
 
 
 In a prospective observational trial we investigate usability and adherence of a monitoring system for lifestyle factors, i.e., daily physical activity levels, dietary habits, mental stress, smoking habit, and sleep quality. Patients (n = 100) scheduled for or who recently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, an electrophysiology study and/or radiofrequency catheter ablation, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation, a fractional flow reserve test and/or a percutaneous coronary intervention, and/or valve surgery are asked to participate.
 The monitoring system consists of a care platform with a custom-built conversational interface¡ªa chatbot¡ªand a wrist-worn wearable medical device. The wrist-worn device collects continuous objective data on physical activity and the chatbot collects subjective data (e.g., sleep quality, nutrition intake and mental stress levels), both for 7 separate days per month repeatedly during the study period. Data collection starts one week before treatment and continues until 1-year after discharge. Via a dashboard, patients can observe their lifestyle measures and adherence to self-reporting, track personal goals, and share their lifestyle data with practitioners and relatives.
 The primary outcome of the trail is adherence to using the integrated platform for self-tracking data. The secondary outcomes include system usability, determinants of adherence and the relation between baseline lifestyle behaviour and long-term patient-relevant outcomes.
 
 
 
 Systematic monitoring during daily life is key to gain insights into patients¡¯ lifestyle behaviours. In this context, adherence to monitoring systems is critical for cardiologists and other care providers to obtain crucial information to personalize care. In this project, we present insights into the evaluation of adherence to monitoring technology including a conversational agent and continuous monitoring, focusing on multiple lifestyle domains for one year.

Four preregistered studies ( N = 3,288), using hundreds of product categories, measured levels of material and experiential qualities using two unipolar items. These studies investigate recalled, evoked, and anticipated happiness. Results show a more nuanced view of the experiential advantage that is critical for future research and consumer theory: material and experiential qualities both have positive relationships with happiness.

We propose that more than just motivating behavior for monetary reasons, incentives also have an important, undiscovered consequence: they leak information about social norms. Four experiments reveal that framing an incentive as a surcharge, as compared to a discount, signals that the incentivized behavior is both more socially approved and more common. These implied norms lead individuals to experience emotions consistent with a desire to conform, motivating them to perform the incentivized behavior. Moreover, by shifting social norms, we find that incentives can influence behavior not only in the moment, but also downstream when there is no longer an active incentive. Further, merely being exposed to a surcharge (vs. discount) incentive¡ªeven without being financially affected by it¡ªcan increase performance of the behavior.

We are interested to learn anything possible about the phenomenon, including its replicability, boundary conditions, and possible moderators. What better way is there to learn more about this effect than to attempt to replicate one of our experiments investigating it across several labs and countries? As of this writing, we do not yet know the outcome of the replication attempt (Verschuere et al., 2018, this issue), so we thought it would be instructive to describe some of the challenges involved in setting up a replication attempt of such magnitude and breadth, and to outline important theoretical and practical considerations in designing experiments in this context. The goal of the current replication effort was to directly replicate one of the six experiments in our original article (Mazar, Amir, & Ariely, 2008). When we began working on the protocol with the Editor and proposing authors, though, we realized that there were more challenges than one would think. Our original experiment was run with students, not in a lab but in a large classroom, in one session, as part of a course requirement, in a particular location and at a particular time, as part of a packet that included other studies that we do not have a record of, and in a particular culture and country. Because we do not know whether and how such factors contributed to our results, we tend to favor conceptual, rather than direct, replications of the experiment. In addition, this realization suggests that it may be useful more generally for authors to report many more details about their procedure than is required for publication purposes, so that subsequent replication attempts could come closer to reproducing meaningful contextual factors. Our hope was that this project could achieve a broad conceptual replication (Lynch, Bradlow, Huber, & Lehmann, 2015), which (compared with a direct replication) would result in greater learning through both replication and creation of new knowledge. Welsh and Ord¨®?ez (2014), for example, used a subconscious priming task (i.e., sentence unscrambling) to obtain the same effect as asking people to recall the Ten Commandments¡ªthat is, to activate their moral standards, and thus conceptually replicate our results, while at the same time broadening the range of potential applications of the theory. Because our theory relates the magnitude of dishonesty to the accessibility of one¡¯s moral standards, any manipulation that increases accessibility of these standards, coupled with any measure of dishonesty, would provide a conceptual replication. Unfortunately, the rules for the current grand replication attempt were stricter and did not allow for such flexibility that could generate a conceptual replication, at least within each individual lab¡¯s replication attempt. We believe that direct replication attempts in the context of moral and honest behavior, although useful to assess ¡°statistical conclusion validity¡± (Lynch et al., 2015, p. 334), bear inherent challenges. We can divide these challenges into those that may inhibit the effectiveness of the manipulation and those that may inhibit the instances of dishonesty¡ªthe basic effect moderated by the manipulation. In what follows, we outline such factors that may make it difficult to observe our originally reported effect across different contexts.

Sudhir, & Wendy Wood)",2018,"How Context Affects Choice, Customer Needs and Solutions (2018)","Purpose
Promotional cues related to notions of fair prices or pricing designed to fit consumers¡¯ needs are prevalent for many service offers. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how both customers¡¯ price fairness and idiosyncratic fit perceptions shape their tariff evaluations.


Design/methodology/approach
Two experimental studies involving different tariff types and service contexts test the complex interplay of customers¡¯ perceived price fairness and idiosyncratic fit with customer and context characteristics on their tariff evaluations.


Findings
Customers judge tariffs drawing on both the perceived price fairness and idiosyncratic fit, driven by the perceived price level of the tariff and the perceived pricing transparency of the firm. Customers¡¯ service usage and consumption goals moderate these effects: heavy users and hedonic consumers indicate lower price sensitivity while focusing more on their transparency perception. The role of perceived price fairness and idiosyncratic fit for tariff choice depends on the tariff/service context; idiosyncratic fit is important when it is incidental (e.g. flat rates) rather than intentional (i.e. customized tariffs) and when customers lack the expertise or confidence to evaluate price fairness such as in the case of relatively new services.


Originality/value
Prior studies focused on either price fairness or idiosyncratic fit and thus cannot fully explain the complex interplay between both in the context of tariff choice.

However, we did observe a significant difference in attitude after writing a counterattitudinal essay compared with writing a neutral essay.

Management Science . Published online on May 02, 2025.",2025,"Contextual Learning with Online Convex Optimization: Theory and Application to Medical Decision-Making (with Keyvanshokooh E, Zhalechian M, Shi C, Van Oyen MP)","Optimizing the treatment regimen is a fundamental medical decision-making problem. This can be thought of as a two-dimensional decision-making problem with a nested structure because it involves determining both the optimal medication and its optimal dose. Identifying the most effective medication for an individual often poses considerable difficulty, and even when a suitable medication is ascertained, dosing it optimally remains a significant challenge. Making these two nested decisions necessitates the adaptive learning of a personalized disease progression control model. To address this problem, we propose a novel contextual multiarmed bandit model under a two-dimensional control with a nested structure. For this model, we develop a new joint contextual learning and optimization algorithm, termed the stochastic subgradient descent atop contextual multiarmed bandit (SGD-MAB) algorithm. It sequentially selects for a patient (i) the best medication based on their contextual information and (ii) the corresponding dose optimized over the prior history of those patients who received the same medication. We prove that it admits a sublinear regret, which is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Our regret analysis leverages the strengths of both contextual bandit approaches and online convex optimization techniques in a seamless fashion. We substantiate the practicality of SGD-MAB using clinical data on patients with hypertension and heightened cardiovascular risks. Our analysis indicates that SGD-MAB has the potential to surpass current practices. We benchmark several policies to show the advantages of our approach and offer critical insights. Our framework holds promise for various applications beyond healthcare that require nested decision-making. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

Alzheimer¡¯s is typically diagnosed through expensive imaging methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as invasive methods, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis. In this study, we develop an interpretable hierarchical deep learning model to detect the presence of Alzheimer¡¯s disease from transcripts of interviews of individuals who were asked to describe a picture. Our deep recurrent neural network employs a novel three-level hierarchical attention over self-attention (AoS3) mechanism to model the temporal dependencies of longitudinal data. We demonstrate the interpretability of the model with the importance score of words, sentences, and transcripts extracted from our AoS3 model. Numerical results demonstrate that our deep learning model can detect Alzheimer¡¯s disease from the transcripts of patient interviews with 96% accuracy when tested on the DementiaBank data set. Our interpretable neural network model can help diagnose Alzheimer¡¯s disease in a noninvasive and affordable manner, improve patient outcomes, and result in cost containment.

We examined the cost-effectiveness of both preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV testing strategies for MSM and PWID in India. Methods We populated an HIV microsimulation model with India-specific data and projected clinical and economic outcomes of 7 strategies for MSM/PWID, including status quo; a 1-time HIV test; routine HIV testing every 3, 6, or 12 months; and PrEP with HIV testing every 3 or 6 months. We used a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$1950, the 2017 Indian per capita gross domestic product, to define cost-effectiveness. Results HIV testing alone increased life expectancy by 0.07¨C0.30 years in MSM; PrEP added approximately 0.90 life-years to status quo. Results were similar in PWID. PrEP with 6-month testing was cost-effective for both MSM (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], $1000/year of life saved [YLS]) and PWID (ICER, $500/YLS). Results were most sensitive to HIV incidence. PrEP with 6-month testing would increase HIV-related expenditures by US$708 million (MSM) and US$218 million (PWID) over 5 years compared to status quo. Conclusions While the World Health Organization recommends PrEP with quarterly HIV testing, our analysis identifies PrEP with semiannual testing as the cost-effective HIV prevention strategy for Indian MSM and PWID. Since nationwide scale-up would require a substantial fiscal investment, areas of highest HIV incidence may be the appropriate initial targets for PrEP scale-up.",Crossref,100,10.1093/cid/ciz249,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz249,2019,Clinical Infectious Diseases,ok,CR-biblio:  The Cost-effectiveness of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Preexposure Prophylaxis and HIV Testing Strategies in Hig,The Cost-effectiveness of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Preexposure Prophylaxis and HIV Testing Strategies in High-risk Groups in India,10.1093/cid/ciz249,,Goal 3,0.035312145,FALSE,

We sought to design, develop, and validate PREDICT-DM (PRojection and Evaluation of Disease Interventions, Complications, and Treatments¨CDiabetes Mellitus), a state-transition microsimulation model of T2DM, incorporating recent data. Methods: PREDICT-DM is populated with natural history, risk factor, and outcome data from large-scale cohort studies and randomized clinical trials. The model projects diabetes-relevant outcomes, including cardiovascular and renal disease outcomes, and 5/10-year survival. We assessed the model validity against 62 endpoints from ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), VADT (Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial), and Look AHEAD trials via several comparative statistical methods, including mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Bland¨CAltman graphs, and Kaplan¨CMeier curves. Results: For the comparison between simulated and observed outcomes of the intervention/control arms of the trial, the MAPE was 19%/25% (ACCORD), 29%/20% (VADT), and 42%/10% (Look AHEAD). The Bland¨CAltman's 95% limit of agreement was 0.02 (ACCORD), 0.03 (VADT), and 0.01 (Look AHEAD), and the mean difference (95% confidence interval) for the comparison between PREDICT-DM and trial endpoints was 0.0025 (?0.0018 to 0.0070) for ACCORD, ?0.0067 (?0.0137 to 0.0002) for VADT, and ?0.0033 (?0.0067 to 0.00002) for Look AHEAD, indicating an adequate model fit to the data.

Non-Proportional Thinking in Financial Markets (with Kelly Shue), Revise and Resubmit, Journal of Finance AQR Insight Award (1st Prize)","Nominal stock prices are arbitrary. Therefore, when evaluating how a piece of news should affect the price of a stock, rational investors should think in percentage rather than dollar terms. However, dollar price changes are ubiquitously reported and discussed. This may both cause and reflect a tendency of investors to think about the impact of news in dollar terms, leading to more extreme return responses to news for lower-priced stocks. We find a number of results consistent with such non-proportional thinking. First, lower-priced stocks have higher total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility, and market betas, after controlling flexibly for size. To identify a causal effect of price, we show that volatility increases sharply following pre-announced stock splits and drops following reverse stock splits. The returns of lower-priced stocks also respond more strongly to firm-specific news events, all else equal. The economic magnitudes are large: a doubling in a stock's nominal price is associated with a 20-30% decline in its volatility, beta, and return response to firm-specific news. These patterns are not exclusive to small, illiquid stocks; they hold even among the largest stocks. Non-proportional thinking can explain a variety of asset pricing anomalies such as long-run and short-run reversals, as well as the negative relation between past returns and volatility (i.e., the leverage effect). Our analysis also shows that the well-documented negative relation between risk (volatility or beta) and size is actually driven by nominal prices rather than fundamentals.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100,10.3386/w25751,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37e91de53e2df11cb49f606aa60b73dddd388006,2019,Journal of Finance,ok,"CR-biblio:Can the Market Multiply and Divide?

This dichotomy of results emphasizes the need foran approach that uses the richness of high-frequency data and, at the same time, produces a direct forecast of the variance at the desired horizon, without iterating. The MIDAS is such an approach, and unsurprisingly, it yields the most precise forecasts of variance both in and out of sample.

Drawing on a longitudinal dataset of college students before and during the pandemic, we document dramatic changes in physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. We show that biometric and time-use data are critical for understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19, as the pandemic has tightened the link between lifestyle behaviors and depression. Our findings also suggest a puzzle: Disruptions to physical activity and mental health are strongly associated, but restoration of physical activity through a short-term intervention does not help improve mental health. These results highlight the large impact of COVID-19 on both lifestyle and well-being and offer directions for interventions aimed at restoring mental health. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=682), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 10,000 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by 25 to 30 min per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 min, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 h per day. Over the course of the pandemic from March to July 2020 the proportion of participants at risk for clinical depression ranges from 46% to 61%, up to a 90% increase in depression rates compared to the same population just prior to the pandemic.

Standard behavioral models predict a tradeoff in the use of loss contracts: employees will work harder under loss contracts than under gain contracts; but, anticipating loss aversion, they will prefer gain contracts to loss contracts. In a series of experiments, we test these predictions by measuring performance and preferences for payoff-equivalent gain and loss contracts. We find that people indeed work harder under loss than gain contracts, as the theory predicts. Surprisingly, rather than a preference for the gain contract, we find that people actually prefer loss contracts.

In a model of competing noise-driven contests, we show that the duopoly prize allocation has fewer (but larger) prizes compared with a monopolist contest designer. We also find that contests with firm-chosen budgets and solvers¡¯ endogenous participation create coordination inefficiencies. Thus, platform policies that constrain the competing firms from freely choosing their budgets and offer solvers non-enforceable recommendations toward specific noise-driven contests strictly enhance total welfare. Extending our framework to include arbitrarily correlated ability-driven contests, we highlight the critical role of inter-contest dependence on the efficacy of a platform¡¯s interventions. Specifically, platform nudges to improve solver-contest (mis-)matches are welfare enhancing only when the contests are sufficiently related, and allowing solvers to self-sort is appropriate otherwise.

The possibility of the quantization of this phase arising from parallel transport in momentum space is essential to our understanding of systems with topological band structures. Although based on the concept of charge polarization, this same theory can also be used to characterize the Bloch bands of neutral bosonic systems such as photonic or phononic crystals. The theory of this quantized polarization has recently been extended from the dipole moment to higher multipole moments. In particular, a two-dimensional quantized quadrupole insulator is predicted to have gapped yet topological one-dimensional edge modes, which stabilize zero-dimensional in-gap corner states. However, such a state of matter has not previously been observed experimentally. Here we report measurements of a phononic quadrupole topological insulator. We experimentally characterize the bulk, edge and corner physics of a mechanical metamaterial (a material with tailored mechanical properties) and find the predicted gapped edge and in-gap corner states. We corroborate our findings by comparing the mechanical properties of a topologically non-trivial system to samples in other phases that are predicted by the quadrupole theory. These topological corner states are an important stepping stone to the experimental realization of topologically protected wave guides in higher dimensions, and thereby open up a new path for the design of metamaterials.",Semantic Scholar,21.91780822,10.1038/nature25156,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88dbc36d7ab66ce99514be111021d76a0d9feec2,2017,Nature,ok,"CR-biblio:Serra-Garcia, M. and Gneezy, U.

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide.

Drawing on a longitudinal dataset of college students before and during the pandemic, we document dramatic changes in physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. We show that biometric and time-use data are critical for understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19, as the pandemic has tightened the link between lifestyle behaviors and depression. Our findings also suggest a puzzle: Disruptions to physical activity and mental health are strongly associated, but restoration of physical activity through a short-term intervention does not help improve mental health. These results highlight the large impact of COVID-19 on both lifestyle and well-being and offer directions for interventions aimed at restoring mental health. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=682), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 10,000 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by 25 to 30 min per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 min, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 h per day. Over the course of the pandemic from March to July 2020 the proportion of participants at risk for clinical depression ranges from 46% to 61%, up to a 90% increase in depression rates compared to the same population just prior to the pandemic.

atmosphere. Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small
footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the
observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of
biosphere¨Catmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with
atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global
vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the
latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net
ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine
learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were
employed. Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM
ensembles (R2>0.94 at 1¡ã spatial resolution)
while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70?% of the land surface, values
outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008¨C2010 from
FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130?PgC?yr?1 with the largest
uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates
agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise R2¡«0.75) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise
R2¡«0.6). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good
consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes,
particularly for temperate and boreal regions (R2>0.92).
Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared
to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological
inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions
(R2=0.87 for 2001¨C2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger
uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics
with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These
discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are
implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such
as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a
combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in
particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on
NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon
sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for
CO2 fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic.
Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP
as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global
carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are
valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of
Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved
quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further
improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall.",Semantic Scholar,10.34482759,10.5194/bg-2019-368,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a09b55a914bd64e301650b63fcbbc96ac91a483d,2019,Biogeosciences,ok,"CR-biblio:Jung, M., L.

Four preregistered studies ( N = 3,288), using hundreds of product categories, measured levels of material and experiential qualities using two unipolar items. These studies investigate recalled, evoked, and anticipated happiness. Results show a more nuanced view of the experiential advantage that is critical for future research and consumer theory: material and experiential qualities both have positive relationships with happiness.

His dissertation is arguably the first to systematically attack the problem of natural image synthesis using deep neural networks. As such, his work has already had an enormous impact on the field, with several of his contributions, most notably CycleGAN, becoming widely-used tools not just for researchers in computer graphics and beyond, but also for visual artists. A key open problem in data-driven image synthesis is how to make sure that the synthesized image looks realistic, i.e., lies on the manifold of natural images? In Part I of his thesis, Zhu takes a discriminative approach to address a particular instance of this problem, training a classifier to estimate the realism of spliced image composites. Since it is difficult to obtain enough human-labeled training data to learn what looks realistic, he instead learned to classify between real images and automatically-generated composites, whether they look realistic or not. The surprising finding: resulting classifier can actually predict how realistic a new composite would look to a human. Moreover, this realism score can be used to improve the composite realism by iteratively updating the image via a learned transform. This work could be thought of as an early precursor to the conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures. He also developed a similar discriminative learning approach for improving the photograph aesthetics of portraits (SIGAsia'14). In Part II, Zhu takes the opposite, generative approach to modeling natural images and constrains the output of a photo editing tool to lie on this manifold. He built real-time data-driven exploration and editing interfaces based on both classic image averaging models (SIGGRAPH'14) and more recent Generative Adversarial Networks. The latter work and the associated software iGAN was the first use of GANs in a real-time application, and it contributed to the popularization of GANs in the community. In Part III, Zhu combines the lessons learned from his earlier work for developing a novel set of image-to-image translation algorithms. Of particular importance is the CycleGAN framework (ICCV'17), which revolutionized image-based computer graphics as a general-purpose framework for transferring the visual style from one set of images onto another, e.g., translating summer into winter and horses into zebras, generating real photographs from computer graphics renderings, etc. It was the first to show artistic collection style transfer (e.g., using all of Van Gogh paintings instead of only the ""Starry Night""), and translating a painting into a photograph. In the short time since CycleGAN was published, it has already been applied to many different problems far beyond computer graphics, from generating synthetic training data (computer vision), to converting MRIs into CT scans (medical imaging), to applications in NLP and speech synthesis. In addition to his dissertation work, he also contributed to learning-based methods for interactive colorization (SIGGRAPH'17) and light field videography (SIGGRAPH'17). Apart from several well-cited papers in top graphics and vision venues, Zhu's work has an impact in other ways as well. His research has been repeatedly featured in the popular press, including New Yorker, Economist, Forbes, Wired, etc. Jun-Yun is also exemplary in facilitating the reproducibility of research and making it easy for researchers and practitioners to build on his contributions. He has open-sourced many of his projects and, as a sign of his impact, he has earned over 22,000 GitHub stars and 1,900 followers. Most impressively, his code has been used widely not just by researchers and developers, but also by visual artists (e.g. see #cycleGAN on Twitter).

This allows consideration of not just subgroups of a priori interest or small dimensions, but the space of all possible subgroups of features.

It has enabled the rovers to drive safely and more effectively in highly sloped and sandy terrains and has resulted in increased mission science return by reducing the number of days required to drive into interesting areas. The MER Visual Odometry system comprises onboard software for comparing stereo pairs taken by the pointable mast©\mounted 45 deg FOV Navigation cameras (NAVCAMs). The system computes an update to the 6 degree of freedom rover pose ( x , y , z , roll, pitch, yaw) by tracking the motion of autonomously selected terrain features between two pairs of 256¡Á256 stereo images. It has demonstrated good performance with high rates of successful convergence (97% on Spirit, 95% on Opportunity), successfully detected slip ratios as high as 125%, and measured changes as small as 2 mm, even while driving on slopes as high as 31 deg. Visual Odometry was used over 14% of the first 10.7 km driven by both rovers.

However, little research has examined gratitude¡¯s impact on loose tie relationships (like coworkers), and similarly little research has examined how gratitude impacts physiological stress responding or biological responses more generally. The present research uses an ecologically valid, dyadic teamwork paradigm to test how gratitude expressions impact in vivo physiological challenge and threat stress responding, assessed via a challenge¨Cthreat index composed of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Compared with a control condition, teammates (n?= 190) who were randomly assigned to a gratitude expression manipulation showed improved biological challenge¨Cthreat responses while jointly completing an acutely stressful collaborative work task (developing a product pitch), and later while completing an individual performance task (pitching the product). During the collaborative task, gratitude expressions buffered against threat responses; during the individual task, gratitude expressions amplified challenge responses. Analyses of cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) aided in determining how cardiac outflow versus vascular constriction/dilation contributed to these effects. The finding that gratitude expressions promote adaptive biological responding at the dyadic level contributes to a growing literature on the social functions of positive emotions and gratitude, specifically.

A maximum haplotype of 36 NITR genes (138 gene sequences in total) can be grouped into 12 distinct families, including inhibitory and activating receptors. An extreme level of interindividual heterozygosity is reflected in allelic polymorphisms, haplotype variation, and family-specific isoform complexity. In addition, the exceptional diversity of NITR sequences among species suggests divergent evolution of this multigene family with a birth-and-death process of member genes. High-confidence modeling of Nitr V-domain structures reveals a significant shift in the spatial orientation of the Ig fold, in the region of highest interfamily variation, compared with Ig V domains. These studies resolve a complete immune gene cluster in zebrafish and indicate that the NITRs represent the most complex family of activating/inhibitory surface receptors thus far described.",OpenAlex,0,,https://openalex.org/W2165296283,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Mueller-Trede 2018 Mueller-Trede, J",,10.1073/PNAS.0405242101,,Goal 15,0.014454972,FALSE,

Two experiments are reported, which suggest that frame-dependent inferences are sufficient to generate attribute framing effects, and that blocking such inferences may block framing effects. Experiment 1 decomposed the typical framing design into two parts: One group of participants saw a target described in one of two attribute frames and reported their estimates (inferences) of the typical attribute value.

By allowing customer information to be transferrable among service providers, portability in theory may help reduce switching costs and promote competition. Yet the actual consequences are unclear. To investigate this issue, we focus on the global wireless industry, and examine the impact of mobile number portability (MNP) policy. We construct a duopoly model with heterogeneous switching costs, which predicts that the market share of the large firm will shrink after MNP, while the average price may depend on firms¡¯ customer base composition. We test these hypotheses empirically on a panel dataset of 218 wireless operators in 52 countries over 6?years. We find relative market share gains for small firms and reductions for large firms under MNP. However, large firms can maintain higher prices than small firms. Probing deeper into customer segmentation, we find that on average, the share of contract customers?increases?for large firms after MNP, while it?decreases?for small firms. Large firms are able to retain higher-value contract customers while small firms tend to attract lower-value ¡°pay-as-you-go¡± customers. Contrary to the policy intention, large firms tend to remain dominant, and MNP is incapable of changing this. In fact, contracts become even more important after MNP, highlighting the sticky ¡°lock-in¡± effect of contracts.

Methods The sample consisted of 142 children in total, divided into 29 pairs of monozygotic twins, 42 pairs of dizygotic twins, and 1 set of dizygotic triplets. Postero-anterior cephalometric radiographs were taken at the ages of 9, 12, and 15 years. Intercanine width, maxillary width, mandibular width, nasal width, and facial width variables were measured. The genetic and environmental components of variance were analyzed with structural equation modeling for multilevel mixed effects. Results Intercanine width was initially mainly characterized by a moderate genetic component at 9 years (53%), with environmental influence increasing at age 12 (36%) and peaking at 15 years (84%). Maxillary width was under strong genetic influence at 9 years (70%), with genetic influence remaining strong up to 15 years (73%). Mandibular width was under additive genetic influence at 9 years (76%), with dominant genetic influence remaining high at 15 years (81%). Nasal width was under strong additive genetic influence at 9 years (69%) but switched to increased environmental influence at 15 years (59%). Finally, facial width had a moderate genetic influence at 9 years (66%), which increased at 15 years (90%). Limitations This study included patients of European descent, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups.

We find a substantial range in the ¡°efficacy¡± of different forcings, where the efficacy is the global temperature response per unit forcing relative to the response to CO 2 forcing. Anthropogenic CH 4 has efficacy ¡«110%, which increases to ¡«145% when its indirect effects on stratospheric H 2 O and tropospheric O 3 are included, yielding an effective climate forcing of ¡«0.8 W/m 2 for the period 1750¨C2000 and making CH 4 the largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than CO 2 . Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning have a calculated efficacy ¡«58%, while fossil fuel BC has an efficacy ¡«78%.

We show that replacement of the traditional instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and temperature changes in a fixed©\ocean model run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial distribution of climate change, normalized to the same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents, suggesting that the global forcing has more relevance to regional climate change than may have been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases intensify the Hadley circulation in our model, increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia, while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics including the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an expanding Sahel. These features survive in model simulations that use all estimated forcings for the period 1880¨C2000. Responses to localized forcings, such as land use change and heavy regional concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific regional characteristics. We suggest that anthropogenic tropospheric O 3 and the BC snow albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing, Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its efficacy.

(with Alicea Lieberman & Andera Morales)",2022,(with Alicea Lieberman & Andera Morales),"Consumers¡¯ lives are filled with myriad behaviors that can be successfully executed with minimal attention. Many such low-attention behaviors benefit from persistence but are often not performed long enough (e.g., hygiene, exercise). The current work examines consumer persistence-failures through an attentional lens. Specifically, drawing on boredom and resource-matching frameworks, we suggest one key driver of poor consumer persistence is that many behaviors demand?less?attention than consumers have available, leaving excess attention that leads to boredom and premature abandonment. The current research thus proposes an attention-matching framework for persistence and suggests that concurrently performing a task that engages?excess?attention will improve the match between attentional demands and available resources, thereby increasing persistence. Five experiments across a range of low-attention behaviors (e.g., toothbrushing, coordination exercise) demonstrate that concurrently performing a task that occupies excess attention (e.g., reading, listening), delays boredom and increases persistence.

There are different types of uncertainty including the number of appointment requests, whether a patient requires surgery, and surgery durations. We develop an integrated multi-stage stochastic and distributionally robust optimization (IMSDRO) approach to determine the optimal clinic and surgery dates for patients such that the access target constraints are satisfied, and the clinical and surgical overtimes are minimized. The IMSDRO approach synergizes multi-stage stochastic optimization with distributionally robust optimization to simultaneously incorporate multiple types of uncertainties by including stochastic scenarios for appointment request arrivals and ambiguity sets for surgery durations. Several new transformations are introduced to turn the nonlinear model derived from the IMSDRO approach to a tractable one, and a constraint generation algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently.

To deal with such demand surges, many hospitals (1) purchased large quantities of mechanical ventilators, and (2) canceled/postponed elective procedures to preserve care capacity for COVID-19 patients. These measures resulted in a substantial financial burden to the hospitals and poor outcomes for non-COVID-19 patients. Given that COVID-19 transmits at different rates across various regions, there is an opportunity to share portable healthcare resources to mitigate capacity shortages triggered by local outbreaks with fewer total resources. This paper develops a novel data-driven adaptive robust simulation-based optimization (DARSO) methodology for optimal allocation and relocation of mechanical ventilators over different states and regions. Our main methodological contributions lie in a new policy-guided approach and an efficient algorithmic framework that mitigates critical limitations of current robust and stochastic models and make resource-sharing decisions implementable in real-time. In collaboration with epidemiologists and infectious disease doctors, we give proof of concept for the DARSO methodology through a case study of sharing ventilators among regions in Ohio and Michigan. The results suggest that our optimal policy could satisfy ventilator demand during the first pandemic's peak in Ohio and Michigan with 14% (limited sharing) to 63% (full sharing) fewer ventilators compared to a no sharing strategy (status quo), thereby allowing hospitals to preserve more elective procedures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sharing unused ventilators (rather than purchasing new machines) can result in 5% (limited sharing) to 44% (full sharing) lower expenditure, compared to no sharing, considering the transshipment and new ventilator costs.",google scholar,0,,,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Mitigating the COVID-19 Pandemic Through Data-Driven Resource Sharing (with Keyvanshokooh E, Fattahi M, Freedberg K).

In US data from 1960 to 2000, a one standard deviation increase in the share of tax receipts in GDP has a statistically and economically significant effect on returns, lowering annualized expected returns by 4 % and 9 % at quarterly and yearly horizons, respectively. Interestingly, the impact of taxes is quantitatively similar for stock and bond returns. These results can partly be explained by the high persistence of taxes so that increases today imply permanently higher tax levels in the future. An increase in government spending has a positive impact on expected returns, but the effect is statistically significant only for bonds at short horizons. Our findings represent a novel test of Ricardian Equivalence using market returns. Fiscal policy shocks account for 3-4 % of the variation in unexpected stock returns and 8-10 % of the variation in unexpected bond returns. When fiscal and monetary policy are jointly identified, our results remain qualitatively unchanged and the quantitative results are only reinforced. More importantly, we find that fiscal policy is at least as important a source of return variability as is the policy of the Federal Reserve. The findings are surprisingly robust to various system specifications, such as cointegration assumptions and variable choice. Our results strongly suggest that fiscal policy shocks should be given more serious consideration in asset pricing.",OpenAlex(search),0,,https://openalex.org/W62697889,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:Fiscal Policy and Asset Returns (with Jose Tavares),,,,Goal 1,0.033949219,FALSE,economic shocks

Most theories assume that violence is motivated by instrumental gain or impulsiveness, and is restrained by moral inhibitions. In these frameworks, dehumanization breaks down moral inhibitions by reducing perceptions of victims as fellow human beings worthy of concern. However, we argue that much violence is actually motivated by moral sentiments, and that morally motivated perpetrators wish to harm fellow human beings. Across five experiments, we show that dehumanizing victims increases instrumental, but not moral, violence. This distinction, between instrumental violence enabled by dehumanization, and moral violence directed toward human victims, has important implications for understanding how morality and dehumanization interact with violence, and for informing violence reduction efforts worldwide.",OpenAlex,0,,https://openalex.org/W2741731936,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Rai 2017 , Valdesolo, P",,10.1073/pnas.1705238114,,Goal 16,0.082905327,TRUE,armed violence; conflict-related violence; violence reduction

In large-scale data with incentivized choices from 3664 participants from India, Norway and Tanzania, we find a significant gender gap in competitiveness in all cultures. However, we find inconsistent results when comparing the competitiveness of lefties and righties. In north-east India we find that lefties of both genders are significantly more competitive than righties. In Norway we find that lefty men are more competitive than any other group, but women's competitiveness is not related to handedness. In Tanzania, we find no relationship between handedness and the competitiveness of either gender. The merged data show weak evidence of a positive correlation between being a lefty and competitiveness for men, but no such evidence for women.

This research shows that people behave dishonestly enough to profit but honestly enough to delude themselves of their own integrity. A little bit of dishonesty gives a taste of profit without spoiling a positive self-view. Two mechanisms allow for such self-concept maintenance: inattention to moral standards and categorization malleability. Six experiments support the authors¡¯ theory of self-concept maintenance and offer practical applications for curbing dishonesty in everyday life.",OpenAlex,0,,https://openalex.org/W2136838186,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Ariely, D., U.

We find that while both piece-rate and competitive incentives lead to greater effort relative to a base-line with no incentives, neither type of incentives improve creativity relative to the base-line. More interestingly, we find that competitive incentives are in fact counter-productive in that they reduce creativity relative to base-line condition. In line with previous literature, we find that competitive conditions affect men and women differently: whereas women perform worse under competition than the base-line condition, men do not.",OpenAlex,0,,https://openalex.org/W2060884662,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Erat, S. & Gneezy, U.
