Drawing on a longitudinal dataset of college students before and during the pandemic, we document dramatic changes in physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. We show that biometric and time-use data are critical for understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19, as the pandemic has tightened the link between lifestyle behaviors and depression. Our findings also suggest a puzzle: Disruptions to physical activity and mental health are strongly associated, but restoration of physical activity through a short-term intervention does not help improve mental health. These results highlight the large impact of COVID-19 on both lifestyle and well-being and offer directions for interventions aimed at restoring mental health. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=682), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 10,000 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by 25 to 30 min per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 min, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 h per day. Over the course of the pandemic from March to July 2020 the proportion of participants at risk for clinical depression ranges from 46% to 61%, up to a 90% increase in depression rates compared to the same population just prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic.

Previous chapters have demonstrated that low interest rates can lead to rising house and stock prices. Since real estate and stocks are predominantly owned by the wealthy, rising asset prices disproportionately benefit already affluent households, thereby exacerbating inequality. An intriguing aspect discussed in this chapter is the reciprocal relationship between inequality and interest rates. As inequality rises, with more wealth concentrated among the rich, overall savings in the economy tend to increase, which can, in turn, suppress interest rates. Thus, interest rates and inequality are deeply intertwined.",Crossref,80,10.1093/9780198946410.003.0009,https://doi.org/10.1093/9780198946410.003.0009,2025,How Low Interest Rates Change the World,ok,"CR-biblio:__re Low Natural Interest Rates the New Normal,_ with Zheng Liu and Jingyi Zhang.",Inequality and Low Interest Rates,10.1093/9780198946410.003.0009,,Goal 10,0.19915218,TRUE,economic inequality; income inequality

This study estimated land surface temperature (LST) in Chuong My district from Landsat 5, 7, 8 and 9 thermal infrared sensors, using different surface emissivity sources. The Google Earth Engine (GEE), an advanced earth science data and analysis platform, offers the estimation of LST products, covering the time period from 2000 to 2024 in study site.

The period 2000-2010 showed that 327.0 ha of land were converted to land for industrial development, urban and residential land, while the period 2010-2024 continued to witness a continued conversion of land to other land use purposes, with a decrease in agricultural land area (65.7 ha) and an increase in industrial land use (65.2 ha), but the rate of conversion was much lower than the previous period (2000-2024). The periods of 2000-2010 and 2010-2024 showed that there have been significant changes in land surface temperature. Most of the surface temperature in the entire region increased by over 20C, especially in the period 2003-2015 when a total area of 1424 ha had the temperature increased by above 30C. This is a consequence of the process of urbanization and industrialization, which began to take place in 2008, along with the process of changing the land cover status of the study area.

Our first contact with Dr Kaplan occurred via his single-authored textbook Clinical Hypertension in its third edition in 1983, published by Williams and Wilikins. Norman went on to write 8 more editions over his >60 year career in high blood pressure care and education. Many a student of the pathophysiology, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension was weaned on his pioneering textbook. Some of our dearest memories of Norman came from his participation in the American Heart Association Hypertension Summer School Programs, which he graciously attended in most, if not all years, over several decades. The Hypertension Summer School was a setting in which 60 to 100 students would camp out for 4 days with about 20 faculty during which we would teach, discuss, and philosophize about hypertension literally from dawn to dusk. Norman was a master at this. The Hypertension Summer School environment brought out the educator and more importantly the consummate “teacher” in Norman. His signature approach to education was characterized by a combination of a thorough knowledge of the field, a direct no-nonsense approach to the lecture, and sprinkled on top of that a healthy dose of Texas humor. One vivid example of his humor was when he spontaneously and seemingly by magic produced an aneroid blood pressure measuring device and stethoscope and took a student’s blood pressure and, while doing everything wrong, proudly exclaimed, “this is why a physician should NEVER take a blood pressure!” The hypertension literature is punctuated by a large number of Kaplan submissions. Norman had an interesting way of titling some of his opinion pieces. His huge reputation in the field of hypertension made him a much sought after opinion leader, writing articles with titles like “Recent clinical trials: the good, the bad, and the misleading”1 “Bashing booze: The danger of losing the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption,” and “Critical comments on recent literature. SCRAAPHY about MAPHY from HAPPHY.” One favorite “Kaplan pearl” was his approach to a patient with urgent hypertension and anxiety in the clinic. He would describe a relatively young patient with elevated blood pressure, in the midst of what sounded like a panic attack, “losing it” in his clinic at Parkland Hospital. His therapy was not a dose of clonidineor a bite-and-swallow capsule of Procardia. Instead, he would reach into a pocket, extract a paper bag, and hand it to the patient with instructions to breathe into this medical device until he returned in a few minutes to recheck the individuals blood pressure. Although we (RRT, DDP) are about a decade too young to have witnessed these, the debates between Norman Kaplan (whose training was in endocrinology) and Jerome Conn from Michigan over the prevalence of aldosterone excess in the 1960s were, from what we are told, genuine events. And, here we are in 2020, still undertaking research on the role of aldosterone excess in hypertension nearly 60 years later. We were, however, old enough and privileged to witness his many questions, discussions, and debates at premier hypertension and cardiovascular meetings including the original “Cleveland” meetings of the now AHA Council on Hypertension and the American Heart Association National Meetings, among others. As Professor Ram details elsewhere in this tribute, we all (we believe) shamelessly copied figures and tables out of Clinical Hypertension, frequently onto transparencies for use on an overhead projector and subsequently on 35 mm projector slides in the era before Powerpoint. There just was not any other source so full of key information in the field of high blood pressure. Norman also contributed sections to UpToDate and the PIER Annals of Internal Medicine medical education component of the American College of Physicians, again providing practitioners with the wisdom of decades of clinical care and an encyclopedic knowledge of the hypertension literature. I (RRT) was fortunate enough to succeed him in both endeavors, literally standing on the shoulders of a giant. His legacy is soundly established, and he will be deeply missed by his family, those related by blood, and the larger family of those blessed by the heritage of a lifetime dedicated to the mission of hypertension research and clinical care that he has left to all of us.",Semantic Scholar,40.54054054,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15234,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f26e61f3d910d4e761b529b067c758dd5d815470,2020,HYPERTENSION,ok,"CR-biblio:Changing Design Education for the 21st Century , She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation, 6.1 (2020) (w",,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15234,,Goal 4,0.052104367,TRUE,teachers

 In cardiac rehabilitation, technological innovations can improve patient-relevant outcomes and are associated with reductions in health care costs by enabling personalized care. Lifestyle factors such as physical fitness, dietary habits, mental stress, and sleep quality, are strong predictors of the occurrence, clinical course, and overall treatment outcomes of common cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. However, these lifestyle factors are rarely monitored, nor used in daily clinical practice and personalized cardiac care. Moreover, non-adherence to long-term self-reporting is common.
 
 
 
 The main purpose of this study is to evaluate adherence to a continuous unobtrusive and patient-friendly lifestyle monitoring system.
 
 
 
 In a prospective observational trial we investigate usability and adherence of a monitoring system for lifestyle factors, i.e., daily physical activity levels, dietary habits, mental stress, smoking habit, and sleep quality. Patients (n = 100) scheduled for or who recently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, an electrophysiology study and/or radiofrequency catheter ablation, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation, a fractional flow reserve test and/or a percutaneous coronary intervention, and/or valve surgery are asked to participate.
 The monitoring system consists of a care platform with a custom-built conversational interface—a chatbot—and a wrist-worn wearable medical device. The wrist-worn device collects continuous objective data on physical activity and the chatbot collects subjective data (e.g., sleep quality, nutrition intake and mental stress levels), both for 7 separate days per month repeatedly during the study period. Data collection starts one week before treatment and continues until 1-year after discharge. Via a dashboard, patients can observe their lifestyle measures and adherence to self-reporting, track personal goals, and share their lifestyle data with practitioners and relatives.
 The primary outcome of the trail is adherence to using the integrated platform for self-tracking data. The secondary outcomes include system usability, determinants of adherence and the relation between baseline lifestyle behaviour and long-term patient-relevant outcomes.
 
 
 
 Systematic monitoring during daily life is key to gain insights into patients’ lifestyle behaviours. In this context, adherence to monitoring systems is critical for cardiologists and other care providers to obtain crucial information to personalize care. In this project, we present insights into the evaluation of adherence to monitoring technology including a conversational agent and continuous monitoring, focusing on multiple lifestyle domains for one year. This work contributes to our understanding of adherence, patient-centred data collection and interpretation, to enable personalized cardiac interventions, improve patient-relevant outcomes, and reduce health care costs.",Semantic Scholar,34.10138249,10.1093/eurjpc/zwad125.158,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e5bd7b684cec64c548dd4d8f6ea5aec78014b6c,2023,European Journal of Preventive Cardiology,ok,CR-biblio:Improving Cardiac Rehabilitation Patient Adherence via Personalized Interventions 2022 Improving Cardiac Rehabilitation ,,10.1093/eurjpc/zwad125.158,,Goal 3,0.053837943,TRUE,healthy lifestyles

Abundant evidence points to a causal link between physical inactivity and increased risk for numerous noncommunicable diseases, such as some types of cancer and heart disease, as well as premature mortality. Yet, despite this overwhelming evidence, many individuals do not meet the recommended amount of physical activity required to achieve maximum health benefits. Because primary care physicians’ advice is highly regarded, clinicians have the unique opportunity to play an important role in enabling patients to modify their behavior at the point of care with the goal of guiding patients to adopt and maintain an active lifestyle. In the current study, the authors evaluate pertinent literature from the fields of medicine/public health and economics/psychology to suggest a comprehensive approach to physical activity counseling at the primary care level. They first examine the public health approach to physical activity counseling, and then proceed to offer insights from behavioral economics, an emerging field that combines principles from psychology and economics. The application of key behavioral economics tools (eg, precommitment contracts, framing) to physical activity counseling in primary care is elaborated.

However, unfair discounting of women’s qualifications and negative assumptions about women’s career commitment imply that female candidates must be overqualified to achieve the same outcomes as male candidates. Across two studies, experimental and qualitative data provide converging evidence in support of this assertion, showing that gender differences in how overqualification impacts hiring outcomes are due to the type of commitment—firm or career—that is most salient during evaluations. Overqualified men are perceived to be less committed to the prospective firm, and less likely to be hired as a result, than sufficiently qualified men. But overqualified women are perceived to be more committed to their careers than qualified women because overqualification helps overcome negative assumptions that are made about women’s career commitment. Overqualification also does not decrease perceptions of women’s firm commitment like it does for men: supplemental qualitative and experimental evidence reveals that hiring managers rationalize women’s overqualification in a way they cannot for men by relying on gender stereotypes about communality and assumptions about candidates’ experiences with gender discrimination at prior firms. These findings suggest that female candidates must demonstrate their commitment along two dimensions (firm and career), but male candidates need only demonstrate their commitment along one dimension (firm).

(with Jean Zhang)",2023,(with Jean Zhang),"We use a global climate model to compare the effectiveness of many climate forcing agents for producing climate change. We find a substantial range in the “efficacy” of different forcings, where the efficacy is the global temperature response per unit forcing relative to the response to CO 2 forcing. Anthropogenic CH 4 has efficacy ∼110%, which increases to ∼145% when its indirect effects on stratospheric H 2 O and tropospheric O 3 are included, yielding an effective climate forcing of ∼0.8 W/m 2 for the period 1750–2000 and making CH 4 the largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than CO 2 . Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning have a calculated efficacy ∼58%, while fossil fuel BC has an efficacy ∼78%. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We show that replacement of the traditional instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and temperature changes in a fixed‐ocean model run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial distribution of climate change, normalized to the same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents, suggesting that the global forcing has more relevance to regional climate change than may have been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases intensify the Hadley circulation in our model, increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia, while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics including the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an expanding Sahel. These features survive in model simulations that use all estimated forcings for the period 1880–2000. Responses to localized forcings, such as land use change and heavy regional concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific regional characteristics. We suggest that anthropogenic tropospheric O 3 and the BC snow albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing, Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate response and introduces greater model dependence, but once it is calculated for a given amount of a forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the response to other forcing amounts.",google scholar,0,,https://openalex.org/W2133484165,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Consumer Pandemic Coping: A Stage Model of Covid-19 Response , Journal of the Association of Consumer Research (2023).

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 114 (32), 8511- 8516. link",2017,", Valdesolo, P","Significance To eliminate violence, we must understand the motives that drive it. Most theories assume that violence is motivated by instrumental gain or impulsiveness, and is restrained by moral inhibitions. In these frameworks, dehumanization breaks down moral inhibitions by reducing perceptions of victims as fellow human beings worthy of concern. However, we argue that much violence is actually motivated by moral sentiments, and that morally motivated perpetrators wish to harm fellow human beings. Across five experiments, we show that dehumanizing victims increases instrumental, but not moral, violence. This distinction, between instrumental violence enabled by dehumanization, and moral violence directed toward human victims, has important implications for understanding how morality and dehumanization interact with violence, and for informing violence reduction efforts worldwide.",OpenAlex,0,,https://openalex.org/W2741731936,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Rai 2017 , Valdesolo, P",,10.1073/pnas.1705238114,,Goal 16,0.082905327,TRUE,armed violence; conflict-related violence; violence reduction

Economics and Human Biology. 43.",2021,"Buser, T, Cappelen, A, Gneezy, U, Hoffman, M","We conduct an intercultural experiment in three locations on three different continents to elicit competitiveness and study whether individual differences in competitiveness are related to handedness. Being a ""lefty"" (i.e., having either a dominant left hand or a dominant left foot) is associated with neurological differences which are determined prenatally, and can therefore be seen as a proxy for innate differences. In large-scale data with incentivized choices from 3664 participants from India, Norway and Tanzania, we find a significant gender gap in competitiveness in all cultures. However, we find inconsistent results when comparing the competitiveness of lefties and righties. In north-east India we find that lefties of both genders are significantly more competitive than righties. In Norway we find that lefty men are more competitive than any other group, but women's competitiveness is not related to handedness. In Tanzania, we find no relationship between handedness and the competitiveness of either gender. The merged data show weak evidence of a positive correlation between being a lefty and competitiveness for men, but no such evidence for women. Thus, our data provide suggestive but not robust evidence that individual and gender differences in competitiveness are partially determined by innate factors, where innate factors are proxied by the complex, prenatally shaped trait of handedness.",OpenAlex,0,,https://openalex.org/W3179578363,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Buser, T, Cappelen, A, Gneezy, U, Hoffman, M. and Tungodden, B (2021).
