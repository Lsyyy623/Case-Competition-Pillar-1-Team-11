Employers can focus either on applicants’ potential and select on foundational skills (e.g., social skills, math skills) or on their readiness and select on more-advanced skills (e.g., pricing a derivative). The higher (lower) the social trust—people’s trust in their fellow members of society—the more (less) employers are willing to invest in employees and grant them role flexibility. Employers in higher-trust societies are therefore more attentive to applicants’ potential, focusing more on foundational skills than on advanced skills. We empirically test this theory by using a novel dataset of more than 50 million job postings from the 28 European Union countries. We find that the higher a country’s social trust, the more its employers require foundational skills instead of advanced skills. Our identification strategy takes advantage of multinational firms in our sample and uses measures of bilateral (country-to-country) trust to predict job requirements, while including an instrumental variable and fixed effects on country, year, employer, and occupation. These findings suggest a novel pathway by which social trust shapes employment practices and organizational strategies.",SemanticScholar,100.0,Goal 10,0.04891284163861005,False,skills development

This study collected 228 valid questionnaires and then executed structural equation model analysis to test the hypotheses.FindingsResults showed that intangible value bindings play a mediating role, which positively affects consumers' willingness to adopt robo-advisors. Consumers' trust in banks and financial consultants are antecedent variables, which positively affect the intangible value bindings between consumers and banks. In addition, when the consumers' investment amount is higher, it will weaken the positive relationship between the intangible value binding and robo-advisor adoption intention.Originality/valueMost of the past studies have focused on whether robo-advisors would replace personal financial consultants.

Typically, bivariate associations of self-related variables with achievements have been reported. Research quantifying the combined predictive power of more than two self-variables has been scarce. Moreover, except for the academic self-concept, these variables have almost always been measured across domains, i.e., without considering the specifics of individual school subjects. The current study aimed to statistically predict academic achievement (operationalized via school grades) in three major subjects (Chinese (native language), mathematics, and English (foreign language)) by using subject-tied scales, namely academic self-concept, conscientiousness, need for cognition, perseverance of effort, and consistency of interest. The sample comprised 791 Chinese adolescents. Each scale was related separately to each of the three school subjects. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were run. The control variable, biological sex, accounted for 2% of Chinese grades and 8% of English grades, but not of mathematics grades. Adding subject-specific self-concept scales increased the explained variance to 7% (Chinese), 16% (mathematics), and 32% (English). Further additions to the other four self-related scales did not increase the variances that were accounted for.

The estimator is based on the empirical characteristic function of the increments of the process scaled by local power variations formed from blocks of increments spanning shrinking time intervals preceding the increments to be scaled. The scaling serves two purposes: (1) it controls for the time variation in the jump compensator around zero, and (2) it ensures self-normalization, that is, that the limit of the characteristic function-based estimator converges to a nondegenerate limit which depends only on $\beta$. The proposed estimator leads to nontrivial efficiency gains over existing estimators based on power variations. In the L\'{e}vy case, the asymptotic variance decreases multiple times for higher values of $\beta$. The limiting asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator, unlike that of the existing power variation based estimators, is constant. This leads to further efficiency gains in the case when the characteristics of the semimartingale are stochastic. Finally, in the limiting case of $\beta=2$, which corresponds to jump-diffusion, our estimator of $\beta$ can achieve a faster rate than existing estimators.",SemanticScholar,94.6153846153846,Goal 8,0.008646397875153245,False,

The sprint is one of the most prestigious events in athletics, requiring a combination of explosive power and acceleration. However, talent identification remains a challenge, as early sprint performance does not always predict long-term success. The aim of this study is to identify and rank the most relevant predictors of 100m sprint performance among young athletes. Material and Methods. This study involved 11 subjects (6 boys and 5 girls) born in 2008, who were in their first year of the U18 category in 2024. They participated in the 100m event both in 2023 and 2024. Speed, strength, coordination, and mobility were assessed using tests, including 30m sprint from a standing start, 60m sprint from a standing start, 30m sprint with a flying start, bounding strides over 30m, standing long jump, triple jump, countermovement jump, medicine ball throw, and Sit and Reach test. Specific agility was evaluated using the Witty SEM system. Balance parameters and lower limb strength were assessed with the SensaBalance platform and the OptoJump system, respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson’s correlation, Spearman’s rank correlation, and Bootstrapped Pearson’s correlation to identify the most relevant predictors. The bootstrapping technique was applied to enhance the reliability of the correlation estimates. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results. The analysis revealed that not all of the 12 assessed tests had significant predictive value for sprint performance. Parameters such as specific agility, static and dynamic balance, squat jump, and Sit and Reach mobility test did not show strong correlations with 100m sprint outcomes. These findings support the use of selected physical and anthropometric variables in a secondary selection model for young sprinters. Conclusions. This study confirms that specific physical, psychomotor, and anthropometric variables significantly influence 100m sprint performance among young athletes. It also proposes a secondary selection model that incorporates the most relevant predictors to support talent identification and training optimization.",SemanticScholar,88.88888888888889,Goal 4,0.00900799891378666,False,

Cimpian,2023,"Why do socioeconomic disparities in achievement emerge so early in life? Previous answers to this question have generally focused on the perceived deficits of parents from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g., insufficient childrearing knowledge). Here, we instead focus on the structure of early childhood education and argue that early schooling contexts provide unequal opportunities for engagement to children of higher versus lower socioeconomic status (SES). As engagement is a longitudinal predictor of achievement, early SES disparities in engagement could serve to maintain or even exacerbate SES disparities in achievement. In Study 1 (1,236 observations; N = 98 children), we investigated preschool students' behavioral engagement during whole-class discussions-a core aspect of early childhood education. Low-SES children showed significantly lower engagement than their peers. Consistent with the claim of unequal opportunities for engagement, these differences were not accounted for by SES differences in language proficiency. As students' engagement in school is influenced by their peers' attitudes toward them, we also examined peer perceptions (Study 2, N = 94, and a meta-analysis, k = 2 studies). We found that preschoolers who show more engagement relative to others during whole-class discussions are perceived as possessing more positive qualities (e.g., intelligence). Given that higher-SES students are afforded more opportunities for engagement (see Study 1), they may be the ones benefiting from these positive peer perceptions as well, which might further boost their engagement. Our results suggest that aspects of early childhood education should be redesigned to foster engagement among all students, regardless of their SES.

The discount rate for projected cash flows and future debt must include a GDP or market risk premium in recognition of the risk associated with future surpluses. Despite current low interest rates, we find that US fiscal capacity is more limited than commonly thought. Because of the back-loading of projected primary surpluses, the duration of the surplus claim far exceeds the duration of the outstanding Treasury portfolio.

Such influences are likely to be among themost consequential because if they persist over time they are likely to be more observable and have bigger effect sizes. They also may be more complex— codetermined by a richer set of factors when they arise and impacting multiple outcomes over the extended periods when they persist. Longitudinal studies therefore hold the potential to provide some of the most invaluable insights into consumption behaviors. The prevalence of such studies in consumer research, however, remains few and far between because such studies can be costly to conduct and difficult to publish when they overclaim causality. Thus, longitudinal analysis has been both lacking among consumer research scholars, and when it is done, it is not always as strong as it could be. Our vision for this special issue on longitudinal effects and consumption, inspired by the journal’s first editor-inchief, Joel Huber, is to encourage consumer researchers to engage in more research that provides longitudinal insights. To achieve this objective, we distinguish between a “longitudinal study” and a “longitudinal insight.”While a “longitudinal study” conventionally involves tracking cohorts or panels of consumers for changes in behaviors over an extended period of time, or correlating multiple variables for cooccurrence in historical data sets, we propose that a “longitudinal insight” can arise even without engaging in such classic longitudinal studies. By focusing on longitudinal insights, in this special issue, we thus broaden the definition of the types of questions consumer researchers might ask, and we include a consideration of more accessible methodologies that could be utilized to provide such insights.

Cimpian,2024,"Within psychology, the underachievement of students from working-class backgrounds has often been explained as a product of individual characteristics such as a lack of intelligence or motivation. Here, we propose an integrated model illustrating how educational contexts contribute to social class disparities in education over and beyond individual characteristics. According to this new Social Class-Academic Contexts Mismatch model, social class disparities in education are due to several mismatches between the experiences that students from working-class backgrounds bring with them to the classroom and those valued in academic contexts-specifically, mismatches between (a) academic contexts' culture of independence and the working-class orientation to interdependence, (b) academic contexts' culture of competition and the working-class orientation toward cooperation, (c) the knowledge valued in academic contexts and the knowledge developed through working-class socialization, and (d) the social identities valued in academic contexts and the negatively stereotyped social identities of students from working-class backgrounds. Because of these mismatches, students from working-class backgrounds are likely to experience discomfort and difficulty in the classroom. We further propose that, when attempting to make sense of these first-order effects, students and teachers rely on inherent characteristics (e.g., ability, motivation) more often than warranted; conversely, they overlook extrinsic, contextual factors. In turn, this explanatory bias toward inherent features leads (a) students from working-class backgrounds to experience self-threat and (b) their teachers to treat them unfairly. These second-order effects magnify social class disparities in education. This integrated model has the potential to reshape research and discourse on social class and education.

Agents iteratively form and communicate beliefs about an unknown state of the world with their neighbors using a learning rule. Existing approaches assume agents have access to precise statistical models (in the form of likelihoods) for the state of the world. However, in many situations, such models must be learned from finite data. We propose a social learning rule that takes into account uncertainty in the statistical models using second-order probabilities. Therefore, beliefs derived from uncertain models are sensitive to the amount of past evidence collected for each hypothesis. These beliefs characterize whether or not the hypotheses are consistent with the true state of the world. We explicitly show the dependency of the generated beliefs with respect to the amount of prior evidence. Furthermore, as the amount of prior evidence goes to infinity, learning occurs and is consistent with traditional social learning theory.",SemanticScholar,80.59701492537313,Goal 4,0.02369474833099443,False,

We document and study two margins of adjustment that are usually absent from this view using microdata in the $10 trillion U.S. residential mortgage market. We first document the limits of the shadow bank substitution margin: shadow banks substitute for traditional—deposit-taking—banks in loans which are easily sold, but are limited from activities requiring on-balance-sheet financing. We then document the balance sheet retention margin: banks switch between traditional balance sheet lending and selling loans based on their balance sheet strength, behaving more like shadow banks following negative shocks. Motivated by this evidence, we build and estimate a workhorse structural model of the financial intermediation sector. Banks and shadow banks compete for borrowers. Banks face regulatory constraints but benefit from the ability to engage in balance sheet lending. Critically, departing from prior literature, banks can also choose to access the securitization market like shadow banks. To evaluate distributional consequences, we model a rich demand system with income and house price differences across borrowers. The model is identified using spatial pricing policies of government-sponsored entities and bunching at the regulatory threshold. We study the quantitative consequences of several policies on lending volume and pricing, bank stability, and the distribution of consumer surplus across rich and poor households. Both margins we identify significantly shape policy responses, accounting for more than $500 billion in lending volume across counterfactuals. Secondary market disruptions such as quantitative easing have significantly larger impacts on lending and redistribution than capital requirement changes once we account for these margins. We conclude that a regulatory policy analysis of the intermediation sector must incorporate the intricate industrial organization of the credit market and the equilibrium interaction of banks and shadow banks.",SemanticScholar,88.1818181818182,Goal 17,0.02003903660855253,False,

However, imagining this activity before deciding whether to perform it can decrease unhappy people's willingness to engage in it. The facial expression that accompanies a negative mood (and the muscles activated by the expression) can conflict with the expression that is elicited by imagining the performance of an enjoyable activity, evoking subjective feelings of difficulty of imagining it. Unhappy people misattribute these feelings of difficulty to the enjoyable activity itself, decreasing their desire to engage in the activity. The effects of metacognitive difficulty are eliminated when (a) unhappy people attribute difficulty to something other than the enjoyable activity and (b) focus their attention on the outcome of the activity rather than the process of engaging in it. Moreover, when an irrelevant factor activates smile-related features while performing the activity, the experience of difficulty is attenuated and its effect on aversion to the activity is not apparent. In contrast, unhappy people also find it easy to imagine an unenjoyable activity and consequently evaluate it more favorably after imagining it.

Understanding these changes can inform state-level decisions about the Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Objective: To investigate the effect of the 2014 ACA Medicaid expansion on the location, insurance status, and type of ED visits.

Design: Quasi-experimental observational study from 2012 to 2014.

Setting: 126 investor-owned, hospital-based EDs.

Participants: Uninsured and Medicaid-insured adults aged 18 to 64 years.

Intervention: ACA expansion of Medicaid in January 2014.

Measurements: Number of ED visits overall, type of visit (for example, nondiscretionary or nonemergency), and average travel time to the ED. Interrupted time-series analyses comparing changes from the end of 2013 to end of 2014 for patients from Medicaid expansion versus nonexpansion states were done.

Results: There were 1.06 million ED visits among patients from 17 Medicaid expansion states, and 7.87 million ED visits among patients from 19 nonexpansion states. The EDs treating patients from Medicaid expansion states saw an overall 47.1% decrease in uninsured visits (95% CI, -65.0% to -29.3%) and a 125.7% (CI, 89.2% to 162.6%) increase in Medicaid visits after 12 months of ACA expansion. Average travel time for nondiscretionary conditions requiring immediate medical care decreased by 0.9 minutes (-6.2% [CI, -8.9% to -3.5%]) among all Medicaid patients from expansion states. We found little evidence of similar changes among patients from nonexpansion states.

Limitation: Results reflect shifts in ED care at investor-owned facilities, which limits generalizability to other hospital types.

Conclusion: Meaningful changes in insurance status and location and type of ED visits in the first year of ACA Medicaid expansion were found, suggesting that expansion provides patients with a greater choice of hospital facilities.",SemanticScholar,94.2201834862385,Goal 11,0.008181720719746103,False,

Innovations in natural language processing (word embeddings) enabled this comprehensive study on variability and correlates of change/stability in both manifest and latent stereotypes for 72 diverse groups tracked across 115 years of four English-language text corpora. Results showed, first, that group stereotypes changed by a moderate-to-large degree in manifest content (i.e., top traits associated with groups) but remained relatively more stable in latent structure (i.e., average cosine similarity of top traits' embeddings and vectors of valence, warmth, or competence). This dissociation suggests new insights into how stereotypes and their consequences may endure despite documented changes in other aspects of group representations. Second, results showed substantial variability of change/stability across the 72 groups, with some groups revealing large shifts in manifest and latent content, but others showing near-stability. Third, groups also varied in how consistently they were stereotyped across texts, with some groups showing divergent content, but others showing near-identical representations. Fourth, this variability in change/stability across groups was predicted from a combination of linguistic (e.g., frequency of mentioning the group; consistency of group stereotypes across texts) and social (e.g., the type of group) correlates. Groups that were more frequently mentioned in text changed more than those rarely mentioned; sociodemographic groups changed more than other group types (e.g., body-related stigmas, mental illnesses, occupations), providing the first quantitative evidence of specific group features that may support historical stereotype change.

However, much of the work on the stratifying power of sports in the workplace has focused on highly unequal societies, like the United Kingdom and the United States, and workplaces within the economic elite. In this paper, we examine elite hiring in Norway, a country that is more egalitarian with respect to social class and gender than countries that are typically the focus of elite research. Drawing from fifty interviews with hiring agents and ethnographic observation of hiring processes in nine organisations, we examine whether and how 1) sports are used in elite Norwegian hiring, and 2) these processes vary between elite labour market sectors that have different compositions of economic and cultural capital. We find that sports are indeed a salient basis of elite hiring in Norway. As in more unequal countries, elite employers intentionally seek out candidates with extensive sporting histories, especially in traditionally high-class, stereotypically masculine sports. However, we find two departures from prior research. First, we find that the emphasis on sports participation—especially extensive participation in high-level organised sporting leagues during adulthood—was strongest in the economic and balanced fractions of the Norwegian elite and least pronounced in the cultural fraction. Second, employers in the economic and balanced fractions favoured current athletes in part because they believed the bodies of athletes brought direct symbolic and economic value to their firms, due to unique aspects of the Norwegian employment landscape. Our work highlights how local features of labour markets shape the construction and deployment of evaluative criteria in hiring.

We argue that admissions practices at elite independent schools: 1) serve as a form of social closure intended to restrict enrollment to young children perceived as able-bodied and neurotypical, and 2) represent a case of essentializing merit, in which elite gatekeepers construct merit as an intrinsic rather than achieved property of individuals.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 10,0.0240855363929284,False,disadvantaged groups

They sell houses quickly and earn a 5% spread. Their prices are well explained by a simple hedonic model, consistent with their use of algorithmic pricing. iBuyers choose to intermediate in markets that are liquid and in which automated valuation models have low pricing error. These facts suggest that iBuyers’ speedy offers come at the cost of information loss concerning house attributes that are difficult to capture in an algorithm, resulting in adverse selection. We calibrate a dynamic structural search model with adverse selection to understand the economic forces underlying the tradeoffs of dealer intermediation in this market. The model reveals the central tradeoff to intermediating in residential real estate. To provide valuable liquidity service, transactions must be closed quickly. Yet, the intermediary must also be able to price houses precisely to avoid adverse selection, which is difficult to accomplish quickly. Low underlying liquidity exacerbates adverse selection. Our analysis suggests that iBuyers’ technology provides a middle ground: they can transact quickly limiting information loss. Even with this technology, intermediation is only profitable in the most liquid and easy to value houses. Therefore, iBuyers’ technology allows them to supply liquidity, but only in pockets where it is least valuable. We also find limited scope for dealer intermediation even with improved pricing technology, suggesting that underlying liquidity will be an impediment for intermediation in the future.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.02297271894999654,False,

We find that for both buyers and sellers, the longer the bargaining party delays, the less likely the opponent is to continue the negotiation by countering. However, the downstream consequences vary. The more the seller delays, the more likely the negotiation will fail, but the more the buyer delays, the more likely the seller will accept the buyer's offer. The effects of delay are robust; they exist even under short amounts of delay (under 6 hours) and for negotiations for low-priced goods.

After observable stock characteristics are accounted for, excess returns on more intermediated stocks have higher betas on contemporaneous shocks to intermediary willingness to take risk and are more predictable by state variables that proxy for intermediary health. Intermediary risk-bearing capacity also explains a substantial and increasing fraction of the variation in conditional risk premia for portfolios sorted on intermediation. These effects are concentrated in stocks held by hedge funds or mutual fund investors who are more likely to be exposed to dealer banks. The empirical evidence supports the predictions of asset pricing models in which financial intermediaries are marginal investors but face frictions that induce changes in their risk-bearing capacity.

(2023). Our variation of their bank-run model demonstrates how credit losses and asset declines from higher interest rates can trigger self-fulfilling solvency runs, even when banks hold fully liquid assets. Banks with high credit losses, greater exposure to interest rate increases, low capital, and high uninsured leverage are particularly vulnerable. Focusing on 2022’s monetary tightening, we assess banks’ exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) loans, which represent about 25% of average bank assets, totaling $2.7 trillion. Loan-level data shows that, after property value declines from rising rates and the shift to hybrid work, 14% of all CRE loans and 44% of office loans are in negative equity (i.e., property values are below outstanding debt). Additionally, 43% of all CRE loans and 64% of office loans may face cash flow and refinancing issues. A 10% (20%) default rate on CRE loans could lead to $80 billion ($160 billion) in additional bank losses. Had CRE distress occurred in early 2022, when the 10-year Treasury yield was around 2%, no banks would have faced failure, even in pessimistic scenarios. However, by 2024, after substantial asset declines, CRE distress could put dozens to over 300 smaller regional banks at risk of solvency runs. We also find evidence that banks, particularly those facing higher solvency risks and lenient state oversight, have concealed credit losses through “extend-and-pretend” practices. Overall, given the composition of bank balance sheets in Q1 2022, higher interest rates pose a greater threat to U.S. banks than credit risk, potentially constraining monetary policy.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.01416698251837687,False,

What is called the selection effect, namely the tendency for cases with a clear outcome to settle out of court, combined with a rational judge's accommodation of this fact, will under the right conditions, make a judge's decisions observationally indistinguishable from decisions based purely on political bias or a coin toss. To derive this conclusion requires us to set up the decision problem as it presents itself to the litigants (whether to settle or not) and as it presents itself to the judge (how to react to the selection effect). Once one does this, a paradox emerges, what we call the paradox of open methods: if rational judges decide to carefully evaluate the merits of the cases that go to court, they will soon come regret this as wasteful effort because the selection effect makes their final decision no different from one they would reach without paying attention to the merits. But if judges ignore the merits of the case, and this becomes generally known and taken into account by the litigants, judges will come to regret doing so because the selection effect will then cease to operate, and it will no longer be wasteful to pay attention to the merits of a case. This paradoxical seesaw can only be resolved in a full game-theoretical model of the strategic interaction between the judge and the litigants.

We define first a sensible yardstick with which to measure the quality of any data-driven formulation and subsequently seek to find an “optimal” such formulation.

For instance, we find that Google’s revelation of relatively low workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a negative stock price reaction, whereas eBay’s revelation of relatively high workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a positive stock price reaction. These stock price reactions are both economically and statistically significant; for example, we estimate that if a technology firm had revealed gender diversity numbers that were one standard deviation higher, its market valuation would have increased by $1.11 billion. Corroborating this plausibly causal field evidence, we also find positive investor reactions to workforce gender diversity in randomized experiments using Prolific participants with investing experience; these reactions seem to be underpinned by investors’ beliefs about potential upsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., reduced legal risks; increased creativity) but not by investors’ beliefs about potential downsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., increased conflict).

We test a new theoretical model proposing that moral condemnation is influenced by competing affective and cognitive processes. Repeated exposure to the same information about a transgression dampens people’s emotional responses, which can reduce moral condemnation (an affective-desensitization process). However, repeated exposure from multiple sources also signals that the transgression is receiving widespread negative attention, which can increase moral condemnation (a cognitive infamy-inference process). These processes’ net effect will depend on how strongly repetition dampens affect vs. signals infamy. Five preregistered experiments (N = 3,939) test our model. Participants rated corporate transgressions to which they had or had not been repeatedly exposed from three sources (news outlets or individuals). Experiments 1 and 2 measured affective reactions, infamy inferences, and moral judgments, finding mediational support for our model. In Experiment 2, and two supplemental experiments, repetition reduced moral condemnation, suggesting that affective desensitization was the dominant process. Experiment 3 was designed to strengthen the infamy process by highlighting over a million negative reactions to each repeatedly seen transgression; consistent with our model, infamy no longer reduced moral condemnation but continued to dull affective reactions, suggesting that affective desensitization and infamy-inference processes offset one another.

Examining the psychological mechanism underlying this effect, I show that consumers are more likely to spend return refunds because they perceive a lower psychological loss and experience less pain of paying when spending refund money than when spending other regularly available monetary sources. Hence, receiving return refunds has a stronger effect on the spending behavior of people who chronically experience an intense pain of paying (i.e., “tightwads”) than those who experience less pain (i.e., “spendthrifts”).

Our review moves beyond dystopian or utopian views of AI by identifying four perspectives—normative, cognitive, structural, and relational—espoused by scholars examining the impact of AI on workplace inequality specifically, and the structure and organization of work more broadly. We discuss the respective strengths, limitations, and underlying assumptions of these perspectives and highlight how each perspective speaks to a particular facet of workplace inequality: either encoded, evaluative, wage, or rela- tional inequality. Integrating these perspectives enables a deeper understanding of the mechanisms, processes, and trajectories through which AI influences workplace inequality, as well as the role that organizational managers, workers, and policymakers could play in the process. Toward this end, we introduce a framework on the “inequality cascades” of AI that traces how and when inequality emerges and amplifies cumula- tively as AI systems progress through the phases of development, implementation, and use in organizations. In turn, we articulate a research agenda for management and organizational scholars to better understand AI and its multifaceted impact on workplace inequality, and we examine potential mechanisms to mitigate its adverse consequences.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 10,0.1769174705532965,True,economic inequality; gender inequality; income inequality; skills inequality

Avant-garde market driving is primarily driven by a desire to rebel against the status quo, at the expense of widespread acceptance; it involves a multiplicity of like-minded individuals such as other producers, intermediaries and consumers; it occurs particularly in contexts where like-minded consumers seek hedonic or aesthetic novelty or social distinction. Breaking new ground comes with substantial challenges. How do rebel producers overcome the challenges of introducing radically different products and successfully sustain avant-garde market driving? Analyzing the wine market in France, we find that avant-garde market driving is initiated and sustained by symbolic disruption and vertical collaboration among producers and intermediaries. This process can provide a strategic advantage to smaller, low-status firms.

It is well known that algorithms that are optimal over certain exponential families can achieve expected regret that grows logarithmically in the number of trials at a rate specified by the Lai–Robbins lower bound. In this paper, we show that when one uses such optimized algorithms, the resulting regret distribution necessarily has a very heavy tail, specifically that of a truncated Cauchy distribution. Furthermore, for p > 1, the pth moment of the regret distribution grows much faster than polylogarithmically, in particular as a power of the total number of trials. We show that optimized upper-confidence bound (UCB) algorithms are also fragile in an additional sense; namely, when the problem is even slightly misspecified, the regret can grow much faster than the conventional theory suggests. Our arguments are based on standard change-of-measure ideas and indicate that the most likely way that regret becomes larger than expected is when the optimal arm returns below-average rewards in the first few arm plays, thereby causing the algorithm to believe that the arm is suboptimal. To alleviate the fragility issues exposed, we show that UCB algorithms can be modified so as to ensure a desired degree of robustness to misspecification. In doing so, we also show a sharp trade-off between the amount of UCB exploration and the heaviness of the resulting regret distribution tail.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 10,0.005985048722758207,False,

Anchoring this research in the domain of creativity, we find that exposing people to creative content believed to have been created by gen-AI (vs. a human peer) increases people’s self-confidence in their own relevant creative abilities. This effect emerges for jokes, stories, and visual art, and it can consequently increase people’s willingness to attempt the activity – even though the greater confidence underscoring their actions may be unwarranted. We further show that these effects emerge because gen-AI is perceived as a lower social referent for creative endeavors, bolstering people’s own self-perceptions. However, for domains in which gen-AI is perceived as an equal or greater social referent (i.e., in fact-based domains), the effects are attenuated.

Across multiple domains and a variety of methodologies (e.g., archival, longitudinal, experimental; N = 12,830), we provide evidence for a prevalent phenomenon we label the opposer’s loss effect. When people frame a preference in terms of opposition to the nonpreferred option (“I’m anti politician B”) versus support for the preferred option (“I’m pro politician A”), it does not change the extremity of their overall preference; however, opposers (vs. supporters) nonetheless report greater negativity to relevant, unwelcome news. As we show, this framing shifts secondary characteristics of the preference, namely, it decreases their feelings of ambivalence in their preference, which amplifies opposers’ negativity when that preference is thwarted. Altogether, these findings advance the literature on framing effects, expand the known antecedents to felt ambivalence, and provide practical advice for forecasting negative, mass sentiment.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 1,0.00832775079726209,False,

The U.S. banking system’s market value of assets is $2.2 trillion lower than suggested by their book value of assets accounting for loan portfolios held to maturity. Marked-to-market bank assets have declined by an average of 10% across all the banks, with the bottom 5th percentile experiencing a decline of 20%. Most of these asset declines were not hedged by banks with use of interest rate derivatives. We illustrate in a simple model that uninsured leverage (i.e., Uninsured Debt/Assets) is the key to understanding whether these losses would lead to some banks in the U.S. becoming insolvent-- unlike insured depositors, uninsured depositors stand to lose a part of their deposits if the bank fails, potentially giving them incentives to run. We show that a bank’s survival depends on the market beliefs about the share of uninsured depositors who will withdraw money following a decline in the market value of bank assets. If interest rate increases are small such that the bank’s decline in asset values is relatively small, there is no risk of a run equilibrium. However, for sufficiently high increases in interest rates, we have multiple equilibria in which uninsured depositor run making banks insolvent (i.e., a “bad” run equilibrium) becomes a possibility. Banks with smaller initial capitalization and higher uninsured leverage have a smaller range of beliefs supporting a “good” no run equilibrium, increasing their fragility to uninsured depositor runs. A case study of the recently failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is illustrative. 10 percent of banks have larger unrecognized losses than those at SVB. Nor was SVB the worst capitalized bank, with 10 percent of banks having lower capitalization than SVB. On the other hand, SVB had a disproportional share of uninsured funding: only 1 percent of banks had higher uninsured leverage. Combined, losses and uninsured leverage provide incentives for an SVB uninsured depositor run. We compute similar incentives for the sample of all U.S. banks. Even if only half of uninsured depositors decide to withdraw, almost 190 banks with assets of $300 billion are at a potential risk of impairment, meaning that the mark-to-market value of their remaining assets after these withdrawals will be insufficient to repay all insured deposits. If uninsured deposit withdrawals cause even small fire sales, substantially more banks are at risk. Regions with lower household incomes and large shares of minorities are more exposed to the bank risk. We also show that decline in banks’ asset values eroded the ability of banks to withstand adverse credit events – focusing on commercial real estate loans. Overall, these calculations suggest that recent declines in bank asset values very significantly increased the fragility of the US banking system to uninsured depositor runs.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.0176049608061976,False,technology bank

Our approach also provides an account of the way in which play should grad- ually adjust to a change in the distribution of game payoffs that are encountered, offering an explanation for the history-dependent play documented by Arifovic et al.

These data are viewed as highly valuable for online advertisers, but their usage faces increasing headwinds. In this paper, we quantify the benefit to advertisers from using such offsite tracking data in their ad delivery. With this goal in mind, we conduct a large-scale, randomized experiment that includes more than 70,000 advertisers on Facebook and Instagram. We first estimate advertising effectiveness at baseline across our broad sample. We then estimate how much less effective the same campaigns would be were advertisers to lose the ability to optimize ad delivery with offsite data. In each of these cases, we use recently developed deconvolution techniques to flexibly estimate the underlying distribution of effects. We find a median cost per incremental customer at baseline of $38.16 that under the median loss in effectiveness would rise to $49.93, a 31% increase. Further, we find ads targeted using offsite data generate more long-term customers per dollar than those without, and losing offsite data disproportionately hurts small scale advertisers. Taken together, our results suggest that offsite data bring large benefits to a wide range of advertisers.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.02317348659253823,False,

In research, imagination must focus on explaining why an effect may have occurred. Then, the practical value of such theorizing is explored. It is argued that good theories, though imagined, should to be viewed as real in that they offer a valuable viewpoint for solving practical problems. They expand the real world of the practitioner rather than existing in some ivory tower outside that world. A different sort of imagination, however, is required to move from an abstract theory to an intervention that can be implemented in the real world.

New work emerges in response to technological innovations that complement the outputs of occupations and demand shocks that raise occupational demand. Innovations that automate tasks or reduce occupational demand slow new work emergence.

This setting is encountered in numerous important applications, such as patient treatment, online advertising, recommender systems, and estimation of treatment effects in econometrics. Most existing methods in offline reinforcement learning construct functional approximations of the value or the transition and reward functions, requiring complex and often not interpretable function approximators. Our approach instead relies on partitioning the system’s observation space into regions constituting states of a finite MDP representing the system. We discuss the theoretically minimal MDP representation that preserves the values and, therefore, the optimal policy of the dynamic system—in a sense, the optimal discretization. We formally define the problem of learning such a concise representation from transition data without exploration. Learning such a representation allows for enhanced tractability and, importantly, provides interpretability. To solve this problem, we introduce an in-sample property on partitions of the observation space we name coherence, and we show that if the class of possible partitions is of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, any coherent partition with the transition data converges to the minimal representation of the system with provable finite-sample probably approximately correct convergence guarantees. This insight motivates our minimal representation learning algorithm that constructs from transition data an MDP representation that approximates the minimal representation of the system.

Dai; Masakiyo Miyazawa,2024,"The basic adjoint relationship (BAR) approach is an analysis technique based on the stationary equation of a Markov process. This approach was introduced to study heavy-traffic, steady-state convergence of generalized Jackson networks in which each service station has a single job class. We extend it to multiclass queueing networks operating under static-buffer-priority (SBP) service disciplines. Our extension makes a connection with Palm distributions that allows one to attack a difficulty arising from queue-length truncation, which appears to be unavoidable in the multiclass setting. For multiclass queueing networks operating under SBP service disciplines, our BAR approach provides an alternative to the “interchange of limits” approach that has dominated the literature in the last twenty years. The BAR approach can produce sharp results and allows one to establish steady-state convergence under three additional conditions: stability, state space collapse (SSC) and a certain matrix being “tight.” These three conditions do not appear to depend on the interarrival and service-time distributions beyond their means, and their verification can be studied as three separate modules. In particular, they can be studied in a simpler, continuous-time Markov chain setting when all distributions are exponential. As an example, these three conditions are shown to hold in reentrant lines operating under last-buffer-first-serve discipline. In a two-station, five-class reentrant line, under the heavy-traffic condition, the tight-matrix condition implies both the stability condition and the SSC condition. Whether such a relationship holds generally is an open problem.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 1,0.007572223368911811,False,

Innovation competition is driving the ‘Business Revolution’ in retail, wholesale, manufacturing, services, and financial technology. Transaction innovation in online platforms and multi-sided markets has raised antitrust concerns about anticompetitive conduct, vertical restraints, consumer privacy, and barriers to entrepreneurship. The article argues that although antitrust policy makers recognize the importance of innovation competition, they need to update their economic frameworks. Antitrust policy makers need to move beyond traditional analysis based on the twin frameworks of perfect competition and imperfect competition. The article provides an introduction to the emerging Economics of Technology & Innovation and examines some implications for antitrust policy. First, antitrust policy should shift its focus from price competition without technological change to address non-price aspects of innovation competition. Secondly, antitrust policy should apply economic analysis that recognizes the critical role of Intellectual Property and technology standards in innovation competition.

Due to their complexity, the sectionalization and GSS problems are usually solved separately, often resulting in a suboptimal solution.

Without other readily available options to quantify social movements, however, big-N studies have continued to focus on protest events via a few large newspapers. With advances in digitized data and computational methods, we now no longer have to rely on large newspapers or focus only on protests to quantify important aspects of social movements. In this paper we use the environmental movement as a case study, analyzing data from a wide range of local, regional, and national newspapers in the United States to quantify multiple facets of social movements. We argue that the incorporation of more data and new methods to quantify information in text has the potential to transform the way we both conceive of and measure social movements in three ways: (1) the type of focal social movement organization included, (2) the type of tactics and issues covered, and (3) the ability to go beyond protest events as the primary unit of analysis. In addition to demonstrating ways that the focus on counting protest events has introduced specific biases in the type of tactics, issues, and organizations covered in social movement research, we argue that computational methods can help us extract and count meaningful aspects of social movements well beyond event counts.

We support this explanation with evidence from both historical data and laboratory experiments. The findings confirm that, compared to non-harbinger categories, in harbinger categories customers are less likely to find their favorite brands when visiting a store, and are less likely to return if their favorite brands are unavailable.

Textual analysis is the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to textual data for automated information extraction or measurement. We survey publications in top accounting journals and describe the trend and current state of textual analysis in accounting. We organize the available NLP methods into a unified framework. Accounting researchers have often used textual analysis to measure disclosure sentiment, readability, quantity, and forward-looking information; compare disclosures to determine similarities or differences; and detect topical themes. For each of these tasks, we explain the conventional approach and the newer approaches, which are based on machine learning, especially deep learning. Then we discuss the typical decisions faced by researchers in implementing the above approaches and the importance of construct validity of text-based measures. The final part of our article discusses future research opportunities. Our article concludes that (1) textual analysis has grown as an important research method for accounting researchers and (2) accounting researchers should increase their knowledge and use of machine learning, especially deep learning, for textual analysis.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 15,0.01604923310711093,False,

Digital platform companies, however, eschew managers in favor of algorithmically mediated customer control—that is, customers rate workers, and algorithms tally and track these ratings to control workers’ future platform-based opportunities. How has this shift in the distribution of control among platforms, customers, and workers affected the relationship between control and resistance? Drawing on workers’ experiences from a comparative ethnography of two of the largest platform companies, we find that platform use of algorithmically mediated customer control has expanded the service encounter such that organizational control and workers’ resistance extend well beyond the execution of work. We find that workers have the most latitude to deploy resistance early in the labor process but must adjust their resistance tactics because their ability to resist decreases in each subsequent stage of the labor process. Our paper, thus, develops understanding of resistance by examining the relationship between control and resistance before, during, and after a task, providing insight into how control and resistance function in the gig economy.

Park,2022,The inequity aversion pricing problem aims to maximize revenue while providing prices to people connected in a social network such that connected people receive prices that are not too different. This problem is known to be NP-hard even when the number of prices offered is three. This paper provides an extended graph formulation for the problem whose LP-relaxation is shown to be very strong. We show that the extended graph relaxation is integral on a network without any cycle. We develop extended cycle inequalities and show that the extended cycle inequalities cut off all the fractional extreme points of the extended graph relaxation on a cycle. We generalize cycle inequalities to zero half cuts performing a Chvátal–Gomory procedure on a cycle. Computational experiments show that the extended graph relaxation results in an integer solution for most problem instances with very small gaps (less than 3%) from optimality for the remaining instances. The addition of zero half cuts reduces the integrality gap significantly on the few difficult instances.,Official Website,100.0,Goal 12,0.01237124040863002,False,

Academic/practical relevance: With new technological innovations, short commitment contracts are found in dynamic environments like distribution, processing, and manufacturing, a trend likely to grow in the future. In contrast to classic procurement, where commitments are long, short commitments lead to new dynamics in which demand visibility allows companies to use flexible resources more efficiently by adapting to demand observations. Methodology: We incorporate flexible capacity and demand visibility simultaneously using a multiperiod newsvendor network model with two nodes that are supplied using dedicated and flexible capacity contracts with short temporal commitment. Results: The optimal commitment to capacity contracts adapts within bounds to the observed demand at each node. The ability to adapt to visible demand becomes more valuable when flexible capacity contracts are available. This allows us to show that demand visibility and flexible capacity can act as complements. Managerial implications: In contrast to conventional wisdom, when contracts have short commitment, companies can enhance the value of demand visibility if flexible capacity is also available as an option.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.02826815242580022,False,

We construct a new case-level dataset on corporate bankruptcy filings and exploit the staggered introduction of specialized courts across Chinese cities. Specialized courts are run by bankruptcy professionals that are less likely to be under the influence of local governments. We find that cases filed in cities that introduced specialized courts are assigned to more experienced, better trained judges, and reach resolution faster. Specialization increases the number of bankruptcy filings and the share of state-owned firms filing for bankruptcy. Cities that introduced specialized courts experienced a decrease in the share of ``zombie'' firms and an increase in average product of capital of local firms. State-owned firms operating under specialized courts experienced a decrease in the size of new bank loans, lower access to new loans, and lower investment in physical capital.

Patients typically attend clinics every 1 to 3 months for clinical assessment. The clinic costs are comparable with the costs of the drugs themselves and CD4 counts are measured every 6 months, but patients are rarely switched to second-line therapies. To ensure sustainability of treatment programmes, a transition to more cost-effective delivery of antiretroviral therapy is needed. In contrast to the CD4 count, measurement of the level of HIV RNA in plasma (the viral load) provides a direct measure of the current treatment effect. Viral-load-informed differentiated care is a means of tailoring care so that those with suppressed viral load visit the clinic less frequently and attention is focused on those with unsuppressed viral load to promote adherence and timely switching to a second-line regimen. The most feasible approach to measuring viral load in many countries is to collect dried blood spot samples for testing in regional laboratories; however, there have been concerns over the sensitivity and specificity of this approach to define treatment failure and the delay in returning results to the clinic. We use modeling to synthesize evidence and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of viral-load-informed differentiated care, accounting for limitations of dried blood sample testing. We find that viral-load-informed differentiated care using dried blood sample testing is cost-effective and is a recommended strategy for patient monitoring, although further empirical evidence as the approach is rolled out would be of value. We also explore the potential benefits of point-of-care viral load tests that may become available in the future.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 1,0.01322192057849357,False,

Depending on the particular mix of response types in the test taker profile, grades of membership in the “real” and “ideal” profiles are defined. This approach overcomes the limitation of existing psychometric models that assume faking behavior to be consistent across test items. To estimate the proposed faking-as-grade-of-membership (F-GoM) model, two-level factor mixture analysis is used, with two latent classes at the response (within) level, allowing grade of membership in “real” and “ideal” profiles, each underpinned by its own factor structure, at the person (between) level. For collected data, units of analysis can be item or scale scores, with the latter enabling analysis of questionnaires with many measured scales. The performance of the F-GoM model is evaluated in a simulation study, and compared against existing methods for statistical control of faking in an empirical application using archival recruitment data, which supported the validity of latent factors and classes assumed by the model using multiple control variables.

We observed the order fulfillment operations at Cainiao, the logistics division of Alibaba which is the largest e-commerce platform in China. We found that workers deviated from the algorithmic prescriptions for more than 5.8% of packages, typically by switching to a larger bin than recommended. This switch increases packing time as well as material and environmental costs. We identify such behavioral deviations and propose a new algorithm that predicts discretionary behavior (e.g., switching to a larger bin) using machine learning techniques to pro-actively adjust the algorithmic prescription. We conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment with the Alibaba Group involving 757 workers and 782,360 packages from August 27, 2018 to September 9, 2018. During the experiment period, we randomly assign orders from Alibaba to either receive our ?human-centric bin packing algorithm?

Relief flows more to higher income individuals than those receiving stimulus checks, partially due to their higher debt balances: 60% of aggregate forbearance is provided to above median income borrowers. On the other hand, forbearance rates are higher among the more vulnerable populations: individuals with lower credit scores and lower incomes. Borrowers in regions with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 related economic shocks and higher shares of minorities were more likely to obtain debt relief. One third of borrowers in forbearance continued making full payments, suggesting that forbearance acts as a credit line, allowing borrowers to “draw” on payment deferral if needed. More than a quarter of total debt relief was provided by the private sector outside of the government mandates. Exploiting a discontinuity in mortgage eligibility under the CARES Act we estimate that implicit government debt relief subsidies increase the rate of forbearance by about 25%. Government and private relief follow similar patterns across income and creditworthiness, suggesting that borrower self-selection in requesting forbearance is an important determinant of debt relief incidence, and drives the distribution of relief across different population strata. Government relief is provided through private intermediaries, which differ in their propensity to supply relief, with shadow banks less likely to provide forbearance than traditional banks.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.06535751679758676,True,debt distress; debt relief

The five comments arising from that process provide well-honed insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the abductive research. The first commentary, by Frank Kardes, offers convincing evidence showing that the techniques of abductive thinking are similar to other explorative techniques currently being successfully used in deductive research. Eileen Fisher sees abductive thinking as integral to inductive and qualitative thinking as it facilitates the generation of new constructs and remaps established ones. Stephen Spiller’s explores the implication of starting from interesting and paradoxical data rather than from established theory. The research challenge then requires a focus on strategic sampling of methods, responses and critical constructs that confirm or limit a provisional theory. Aparna Labroo articulates the benefits of abductive thinking to help resolve complex practical problems, but warns against the proliferation of multiple findings that may be difficult to validate.

In BSP, the firm offers the customer a menu of different sizes and prices. The customer then chooses the size that maximizes his surplus and customizes his bundle given his chosen size. While BSP is commonly used across several industries, little is known about the optimal BSP policy in terms of sizes and prices along with the theoretical properties of its profit. In this paper, we provide a simple and tractable theoretical framework to analyze the large-scale BSP problem where a multi-product firm is selling a large number of products. The BSP problem is in general hard as it involves optimizing over order statistics, however we show that for large numbers of products, the BSP problem transforms from a hard multi-dimensional problem to a simple multi-unit pricing problem with concave and increasing utilities. Our framework allows us to identify the main source of inefficiency of BSP that is the heterogeneity of marginal costs across products. For this reason, we propose two new BSP policies called “clustered BSP” and “assorted BSP” that significantly reduce the inefficiency of regular BSP. We then utilize our framework to study richer models of BSP such as when customers have budgets and when there exist multiple customer types.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 12,0.008957762423081538,False,

Specifically, the LCM procedure is based on fractional filtering and band spectrum regression using a suitably selected set of frequency ordinates. Contrary to existing procedures, we establish a uniform Gaussian limit theory and a standard $\chi^2$-distributed test statistic. Using the LCM inference and testing techniques, we explore predictive regressions for the realized return variation. Standard least squares inference indicates that popular financial and macroeconomic variables convey valuable information about future return volatility. In contrast, we find no significant evidence using our robust LCM procedure.

We propose a preference condition, Monotonicity in Optimal Mixtures, which says that surely improving the act f (in the sense of weak dominance) makes the optimal weight(s) on f weakly higher. We use a stylized model of a sales agent reacting to incentives to illustrate the tight connection between Monotonicity in Optimal Mixtures and a monotone comparative static of interest in applications. We then explore more generally the relation between this condition and preferences exhibiting ambiguity-sensitive behavior as in the classic Ellsberg (1961) paradoxes. We find that Monotonicity in Optimal Mixtures and ambiguity aversion (even only local to an event) are incompatible for a large and popular class of ambiguity-sensitive preferences (the c-linearly biseparable class of Ghirardato and Marinacci, 2001). This implies, for example, that maxmin expected utility (MEU) preferences (Gilboa and Schmeidler, 1989) are consistent with Monotonicity in Optimal Mixtures if and only if they are subjective expected utility preferences. This incompatibility is not between Monotonicity in Optimal Mixtures and ambiguity aversion per se. For example, we show that smooth ambiguity preferences (Klibanoff, Marinacci and Mukerji, 2005) can satisfy both properties as long as they are not too ambiguity averse.

We argue that the combination of two forces - the growing importance of intangible capital and rising rents - contributed to this decline. Intangibles omitted from measures of the capital stock bias measured TFP growth downward by misstating capital growth. However, the corresponding omission of investment in GDP would lead to a counterfactually high measured labor share. Rising rents induce an opposing bias which offsets this labor share effect. Hence, the biases from intangible capital and rents reinforce one other. Using the input-output tables, we estimate that these forces could account for one-third to one-half of the decline in measured TFP growth.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 8,0.02725770878979931,False,

After casting their vote, heterogeneous citizens decide whether or not to participate in a protest, and they are more willing to do so if they expect others to protest as well.

Much of this research has focused on evaluations with transparent criteria, but increasingly, algorithmic evaluation systems are not transparent. Drawing on over three years of interviews, archival data, and observations as a registered user on a labor platform, I studied how freelance workers contend with an opaque third-party evaluation algorithm—and with what consequences. My findings show the platform implemented an opaque evaluation algorithm to meaningfully differentiate between freelancers’ rating scores. Freelancers experienced this evaluation as a form of control but could not align their actions with its criteria because they could not clearly identify those criteria. I found freelancers had divergent responses to this situation: some experimented with ways to improve their rating scores, and others constrained their activity on the platform. Their reactivity differed based not only on their general success on the platform—whether they were high or low performers—but also on how much they depended on the platform for work and whether they experienced setbacks in the form of decreased evaluation scores. These workers experienced what I call an “invisible cage”: a form of control in which the criteria for success and changes to those criteria are unpredictable. For gig workers who rely on labor platforms, this form of control increasingly determines their access to clients and projects while undermining their ability to understand and respond to factors that determine their success.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 16,0.009543320869434005,False,

The present research considers whether the affective benefits of reappraisal extend to past experiences of discrimination. Specifically, we examine whether using self-distanced reappraisal (Studies 1 and 2) or positive reappraisal (Study 2) when contending with sexism yields more positive and less negative affective outcomes, relative to engaging in self-immersion. Contrary to previous research examining more general negative interpersonal experiences, we find limited evidence that self-distanced reappraisal is an effective emotion-regulation strategy for women contending with sexism (N = 1,236). The present work offers preliminary evidence, however, that positive reappraisal may be a promising emotion-regulation strategy that reduces the negative affective consequences associated with reliving past instances of sexism, compared with either self-immersion or self-distanced reappraisal.

We took an unconventional approach to improving clinic scheduling policies by collaborating with our colleagues at the Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management to implement queuing theory as a novel approach to address a previously unyielding problem. In 2015, as part of a multidisciplinary intervention to improve outcomes for hospitalized heart failure patients, we systematically identified all patients within our hospital at risk for heart failure-related readmissions through a daily enterprise data warehouse screen4; developed a multidisciplinary bridge and transition team to engage patients during the index hospitalization; and then deployed queuing theory to first assess and then improve clinic follow-up. Queuing theory is the mathematical study of waiting times.5,6 With roots in the telecommunications field, it has widespread applications in several processes such as understanding supermarket lines and managing factory inventory. A particularly powerful insight arising from queuing theory is the notion that extra capacity, or a capacity buffer, is necessary to ensure system performance when variable demand arises, such as for a hospital discharge clinic. We opted to use queuing theory to analyze hospital discharge load and understand the capacity needed in clinic to reduce wait times and improve access.

We review emerging research on the negative consequences of collective autonomy restriction for well-being, as well as its implications for group members' motivation to fight for their place within social hierarchies. We propose that group members desire two resources tied to having a favorable position within the social hierarchy—structural power (i.e., the ability to influence and resist influence from other groups) and status (being positively valued and perceived as moral by others)—because they believe that having power and status are necessary to secure their group's collective autonomy. We hypothesize that group members anticipate that other groups might restrict their group if they lack the structural power to resist outside influences, or if they are perceived as negative or immoral and worthy of restriction. We apply this power and status perspective of collective autonomy restriction to predict (1) when disempowered groups are most likely to fight against (vs. tolerate) their disadvantaged position and (2) when powerful groups are most likely to relinquish power and acknowledge their transgressions (vs. defensively maintain their privileged position).",Official Website,100.0,Goal 1,0.02909158973923079,False,

How long will people reference it in their conversations, and for how many years will other authors cite its findings in their own works? A community’s attention to a cultural object decays as time passes, a process known as collective forgetting. Recent work models this decay as the result of two different processes. One linked to communicative memory—memories sustained by human communication—and the other linked to cultural memory—memories sustained by the physical recording of content. Collective forgetting has significant impacts on communities, yet little is known about how the collective forgetting dynamic changes over time. Here, we study the temporal changes of collective memory and attention by focusing on two knowledge communities: inventors and physicists. We use data on patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and physics papers published by the American Physical Society (APS) to quantify those changes over time. The model enables us to distinguish between two branches of forgetting. One branch is short-lived, going directly from communicative memory to oblivion. The other branch is long-lived, going from communicative memory to cultural memory before going on to oblivion. The data analysis shows an increase in the forgetting rate for both communities as the amount of information in each of them grows.

Using detailed data on theaters' daily scheduling decisions, we assess the effects of digitization on theaters' assortment decisions between 2006-16. We show that digitization helps theaters provide consumers with more product variety, through greater scheduling flexibility, but it also leads theaters to disproportionately concentrate the supply of screens towards the top movie. We develop a theoretical model to show that the change in product variety and supply concentration is moderated by demand fluctuations, and test these predictions by exploiting within-week variation in movie demand. As predicted, the impact of digitization on product variety and supply concentration varies by weekend evening (i.e., peak demand) vs. other time slots. The increase in supply concentration is limited to weekend evening time slots. In other time slots, there is a decrease in supply concentration. Product variety increases in all time slots except for weekend evenings.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 9,0.01424409851145898,False,

However, the monitoring of clinicians by external individuals (ie, those outside the profession or emanating from outside clinical teams) raises difficult questions relating to the autonomy of clinicians and an organisation’s control over clinical work. Typically, documentation improvement initiatives have relied solely on electronic monitoring systems to vet clinician documentation. In such systems, quality personnel monitor clinical documentation and, on encountering potentially problematic content, use an electronic querying system to ask the clinicians to voluntarily clarify or modify the text if appropriate. Importantly, clinicians retain their professional autonomy and can choose to disagree with documentation requests. The current study empirically examines a clinical documentation improvement program which takes a different approach. This programme uses two modes of querying clinicians: (1) conventional electronic documentation clarification queries and (2) in-person verbal documentation clarification requests. Methods We conducted regression analyses using archival documentation query data (n=19?650) from an American teaching hospital to compare the efficacy of conventional electronic documentation clarification queries and in-person verbal documentation clarification requests. Our dependent variable is the length of time between the documentation clarification request and the resolution of the query (ie, the time until a clinician responds). Findings Our analyses demonstrate that in-person verbal documentation clarification requests are associated with a 30-hour reduction in the time it takes for a query to be resolved relative to electronic-only queries. Practical implications The results suggest that while electronic regulatory systems might afford hospitals with opportunities to scale quality initiatives in a cost-effective manner, organisational efforts to influence clinical work may yet benefit from the human touch of in-person regulator–clinician interaction. Furthermore, the replacement of in-person compliance interactions with digital compliance requests can potentially produce negative compliance outcomes.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.008542222069761003,False,

When near-term base appointment capacity is full, the scheduler faces a trade-off between delaying an appointment at the risk of costly failures versus the additional cost of scheduling the appointment sooner using surge capacity. Most appointment scheduling literature in operations focuses on the trade-off between waiting times versus utilization. In contrast, we analyze preventative appointment scheduling and its impact on the broader service supply network when the firm is responsible for service and failure costs. We adopt a stochastic dynamic programming (DP) formulation to characterize the optimal scheduling policy and evaluate heuristics. We present sufficient conditions for the optimality of simple policies. When analytical solutions are intractable, we solve the DP numerically and present optimality gaps for several practical policies in a health care setting.

Samples are collected from patients at remote point-of-care health facilities, and diagnostic tests are performed at centralized laboratories. Sample transportation systems that deliver diagnostic samples and test results are crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment in such diagnostic networks. However, they often lack the timely and accurate data (eg, the quantity and location of samples prepared for collection) required for efficient operation. Objective: This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility, adoption, and accuracy of a distributed data collection system that leverages basic mobile phone technology to gather reports on the quantity and location of patient samples and test results prepared for delivery in the diagnostic network of Malawi. Methods: We designed a system that leverages unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) technology to enable health workers to submit daily reports describing the quantity of transportation-ready diagnostic samples and test results at specific health care facilities, free of charge with any mobile phone, and aggregate these data for sample transportation administrators. We then conducted a year-long field trial of this system in 51 health facilities serving 3 districts in Malawi. Between July 2019 and July 2020, the participants submitted daily reports containing the number of patient samples or test results designated for viral load, early infant diagnosis, and tuberculosis testing at each facility. We monitored daily participation and compared the submitted USSD reports with program data to assess system feasibility, adoption, and accuracy. Results: The participating facilities submitted 37,771 reports over the duration of the field trial. Daily facility participation increased from an average of 50% (26/51) in the first 2 weeks of the trial to approximately 80% (41/51) by the midpoint of the trial and remained at or above 80% (41/51) until the conclusion of the trial. On average, more than 80% of the reports submitted by a facility for a specific type of sample matched the actual number of patient samples collected from that facility by a courier. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a USSD-based system is a feasible, adoptable, and accurate solution to the challenges of untimely, inaccurate, or incomplete data in diagnostic networks. Certain design characteristics of our system, such as the use of USSD, and implementation characteristics, such as the supportive role of the field team, were necessary to ensure high participation and accuracy rates without any explicit financial incentives.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 3,0.05342329607150429,True,health infrastructure

Memory efficacy refers to people’s general belief that they will be able to remember in the future the things they are experiencing or doing in the present. We hypothesize and find across five studies that when consumers have low memory-efficacy (vs. control), they are less likely to behave virtuously because their actions seem less consequential for their self-concept (i.e., less self-diagnostic). Using two different experimental manipulations of memory efficacy, we examine its effect on virtuous behavior in the context of prosocial choices—i.e., charitable giving (study 1A) and volunteering (study 1B and 2).

Using data from several sources, including a lab-in-the-field experiment across an abandoned historical boundary, I show that the effect of the historical state is primarily sustained by culturally transmitted norms of obedience.

We argue, however, that contagious disease cues can also elicit fear. Across four experiments and two large empirical data analyses of the presence of contagious disease on actual consumption behavior, we find that cues of contagious disease increase both fear and disgust, and these emotions together form a unique behavioral tendency with respect to consumer behavior. Relative to either emotion alone, disgust and fear increase preference for more familiar products asymmetrically over less familiar ones. These results contribute theoretically to research on complex emotional states and the behavioral tendencies of emotions, document a systematic and consequential impact of contagious disease cues on real consumption behavior, and have significant practical implications for marketers.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 3,0.02579651324584025,False,communicable diseases

In equilibrium, changes in the regulation depend on the status-quo, the standard-setters political influence and the cost-benefit of disclosure. If the standard-setter is sufficiently influent or disclosure costs are low, the standard features a classification that may become finer over time and converges to the level of disclosure preferred by standard-setters. Otherwise, political pressures may create endogenous cycles in the implemented regulation. During such cycles, periods of slow or moderate increases in mandatory disclosure are punctuated by short bursts of deregulation.

As a result, negotiations in many settings are less likely to be characterized by information asymmetry, or that sellers hold private information that buyers don’t have. A number of negotiation-based industries have reacted to this change by shifting their attention to earning profits in aftermarkets: products and services that augment the main purchase (e.g. add-on items, insurance, financing, service and maintenance, etc.). In these aftermarkets firms often retain an information advantage, even if information asymmetries are eliminated for the main purchase. We use this setting of information symmetry in the ‘frontend’ (main purchase) and information asymmetry in the ‘backend’ (aftermarket) to conduct research that has not been considered in the literature so far. We argue that the symmetry in the frontend provides an opportunity to build trust, since the knowledgeable customer can verify the accuracy of information disclosed by the seller. Across one observational study and two experiments, we show that disclosing sellers’ cost at the beginning of the negotiation, by revealing the manufacturer’s invoice of the product, builds trust in the frontend, which pays off in the backend. In an observational study in the automotive industry, we found that customers to whom the salesperson revealed the invoice price at the beginning of the negotiation spent significantly more in the backend and were more likely to come back for service a year after, compared to those to whom the invoice was either revealed later through the negotiation or not disclosed at all.

Managers given broadening questions about an example set in an unfamiliar industry were more open to learning than managers who were asked narrowing questions about an example set in a familiar industry. Openness to learning in turn fostered successfully applying the key negotiation principle to resolve a subsequent faceâ€toâ€face negotiation.

Target Product Profiles (TPPs) are often utilised at an early stage in the medical device development process to enable user-defined performance characteristics for a given setting. TPPs can also be applied to assess the profile and match of existing devices for a given context. Methods: We developed initial TPPs for 15 newborn product categories for LMIC settings. A Delphi-like process was used to develop the TPPs. Respondents completed an online survey where they scored their level of agreement with each of the proposed performance characteristics for each of the 15 devices. Characteristics with?75% agreement between respondents were discussed and voted on using Mentimeter™ at an in-person consensus meeting. Findings: The TPP online survey was sent to 180 people, of which 103 responded (57%). The majority of respondents were implementers/clinicians (51%, 53/103), with 50% (52/103) from LMIC. Across the 15 TPPs, 403 (60%) of the 668 performance characteristics did not achieve?>?75% agreement. Areas of disagreement were voted on by 69 participants at an in-person consensus meeting, with consensus achieved for 648 (97%) performance characteristics. Only 20 (3%) performance characteristics did not achieve consensus, most (15/20) relating to quality management systems. UNICEF published the 15 TPPs in April 2020, accompanied by a report detailing the online survey results and consensus meeting discussion, which has been viewed 7,039 times (as of January 2023). Conclusions: These 15 TPPs can inform developers and enable implementers to select neonatal care products for LMIC.

Exploiting a quasi-natural experiment at a large North American university, we found that the number of scale points used in faculty teaching evaluations—whether instructors were rated on a scale of 6 versus a scale of 10—significantly affected the size of the gender gap in evaluations. A survey experiment, which presented all participants with an identical lecture transcript but randomly varied instructor gender and the number of scale points, replicated this finding and suggested that the number of scale points affects the extent to which gender stereotypes of brilliance are expressed in quantitative ratings. These results highlight how seemingly minor technical aspects of performance ratings can have a major effect on the evaluation of men and women.

Hubbard; Michael Mazzeo,2019,"Most canonical models of competition conclude that increases in demand should (weakly) lead to more firms. However, in models where competition is in quality, and quality is produced with fixed costs, increases in demand can lead to a competitive response that brings about shakeouts ? higher demand can lead to fewer firms. This paper provides empirical evidence of this effect in the context of hotels and motels in the mid-to-late 20th century, where an important element of quality competition took the form of whether firms supplied recreational amenities such as swimming pools. We first provide evidence that the completion of Interstate highways is associated greater demand for lodging, showing that it is associated with increases in employment in the sector. We then investigate how industry structure adjusts to these shocks; we show that highway completion leads to fewer (but larger) firms. On average in our sample, the completion of highways leads to shakeouts. We then examine whether this effect is greater in warmer areas where the returns to investment in outdoor recreational amenities (i.e., swimming pools) are greater. We show that while the increase in employment in this industry is the same in warmer and cooler regions, highway completion only led to shakeouts in warmer regions. Finally, we investigate whether these effects appear when looking at restaurants, an industry where quality is supplied primarily through variable costs rather than fixed costs (Berry/Waldfogel,2010). Unlike for hotels and motels, we find no evidence that highway completion is associated with shakeouts in this industry. Our evidence connects to an important, but sometimes overlooked, finding of Sutton (1992): shakeouts ? which in some cases could take the form or merger or merger waves ? can be catalyzed by increases in market size. The competitive responses that lead to shake-outs need not only be initiated by changes in the ?technology? that produces quality, but sometimes can be initiated simply by positive demand shocks. Firms? incentives to grow ? and in some cases to merge with other firms -- in response to demand increases need not be motivated by anticompetitive incentives, but rather may be motivated by increased incentives to compete more effectively on nonprice dimensions.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 8,0.02696336083488828,False,economic growth; innovation; medium enterprises; micro enterprises; small enterprises; technological upgrading

Consequently, it is useful to understand how the priority scheme chosen by a revenue-maximizing firm differs from the one a social planner would use. We examine this in a single server-queue with customers that draw their valuation from a continuous distribution and have a per-period waiting cost that is proportional to their realized valuation. The decision maker must post a menu offering a finite number of waiting time-price pairs. There are then three dimensions on which a revenue maximizer and social planner can differ: coverage (i.e., how many customer in total to serve), coarseness (i.e., how many classes of service to offer), and classification (i.e., how to map customers to priority levels). We show that differences between the decision makers? priority policies are all about classification. Both are content to offer very coarse schemes with just two priority levels, and they will have negligible differences in coverage. However, differences in classification are persistent. Further, a revenue maximizer may ? relative to the social planner ? have too few or too many high priority customers. Whether the revenue maximizer over- or under-stuffs the high priority class depends on a measure of consumer surplus that is captured by the mean residual life function of the valuation distribution.

The panel consists of options written on the underlying asset with a (different) set of strikes and maturities available across the observation times. We consider an asymptotic setting in which the cross-sectional dimension of the panel increases to infinity, while the time span remains fixed. The information set is augmented with high-frequency data on the underlying asset. Given a para- metric specification for the risk-neutral asset return dynamics, the option prices are nonlinear functions of a time-invariant parameter vector and a time-varying latent state vector (or factors). Furthermore, no-arbitrage restrictions impose a direct link between some of the quantities that may be identified from the return and option data. These include the so-called jump activity index as well as the time-varying jump intensity. We propose penalized least squares estimation in which we min- imize the L2 distance between observed and model-implied options. In addition, we penalize for the deviation of the model-implied quantities from their model-free counterparts, obtained from the high-frequency returns. We derive the joint asymp- totic distribution of the parameters, factor realizations and high-frequency measures, which is mixed Gaussian. The different components of the parameter and state vec- tor exhibit different rates of convergence, depending on the relative (asymptotic) informativeness of the high-frequency return data and the option panel.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.01521675109876696,False,

The panel has a large cross-section and a time span that may be either small or large. Moreover, we incorporate an additional source of information, provided by noisy observations on some known functions of the factor realizations. The estimation is carried out via penalized least squares, i.e., by minimizing the L_2 distance between observations from the panel and their model-implied counterparts, augmented by a penalty for the deviation of the extracted factors from the noisy signals of them. When the time dimension is fixed, the limit distribution of the parameter vector is mixed Gaussian with conditional variance depending on the path of the factor realizations. On the other hand, when the time span is large, the convergence rate is faster and the limit distribution is Gaussian with a constant variance. In this case, however, we incur an incidental parameter problem since, at each point in time, we need to recover the concurrent factor realizations. This leads to an asymptotic bias that is absent in the setting with a fixed time span. In either scenario, the limit distribution of the estimates for the factor realizations is mixed Gaussian, but is related to the limiting distribution of the parameter vector only in the scenario with a fixed time horizon. Although the limit behavior is very different for the small versus large time span, we develop a feasible inference theory that applies, without modification, in either case. Hence, the user need not take a stand on the relative size of the time dimension of the panel. Similarly, we propose a time-varying data-driven weighting of the penalty in the objective function, which enhances efficiency by adapting to the relative quality of the signal for the factor realizations.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 8,0.005368919532677198,False,

Moreover, intangibles have distinct economic features compared to physical capital. For example, they are scalable (e.g., software) though some also have legal protections (e.g., patents or copyrights). These characteristics may have enabled the rise in industry concentration over the last two decades. Indeed, we show that the rise in intangibles is driven by industry leaders and coincides with increases in their market share and hence, rising industry concentration. Moreover, intangibles are associated with at least two drivers of rising concentration: market power and productivity gains. Productivity gains derived from intangibles are strongest in the Consumer sector, while market power derived from intangibles is strongest in the Healthcare sector. These shifts have important policy implications, since intangible capital is less interest-sensitive and less collateralizable than physical capital, potentially weakening traditional transmission mechanisms.

Whether racial bias varies by symptoms of burnout among resident physicians is unknown. Objective To assess the association between burnout and explicit and implicit racial biases toward black people in resident physicians. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study obtained data from surveys completed by first-year medical students and resident physicians in the United States as part of the Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation Study. Participants were followed up from enrollment in 2010 to 2011 through 2017. Participants completed questionnaires at year 4 of medical school as well as at the second and third years of residency. Only data from resident physicians who self-identified as belonging to a racial group other than black (n?=?3392) were included in the analyses because of scarce evidence of racial bias in the care provided to black patients by black physicians. Resident physicians training in radiology or pathology were excluded because they provided less direct patient interaction. Main Outcomes and Measures Burnout symptoms were measured by 2 single-item measures from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Explicit attitudes about white and black people were measured by a feeling thermometer (FT, from 0 to 100 points, ranging from very cold or unfavorable [lowest score] to very warm or favorable [highest score]; included in the second-year [R2] and third-year [R3] questionnaires). The R2 Questionnaire included a racial Implicit Association Test (IAT; range: –2 to 2). Results Among the 3392 nonblack resident physician respondents, 1693 (49.9%) were male, 1964 (57.9%) were younger than 30 years, and 2362 (69.6%) self-identified as belonging to the white race. In this cohort, 1529 of 3380 resident physicians (45.2%) had symptoms of burnout and 1394 of 3377 resident physicians (41.3%) had depression. From this group, 12 did not complete the burnout items and 15 did not complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) items. The mean (SD) FT score toward black people was 77.9 (21.0) and toward white people was 81.1 (20.1), and the mean (SD) racial IAT score was 0.4 (0.4). Burnout at the R2 Questionnaire time point was associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases. In multivariable analyses adjusting for demographics, specialty, depression, and FT scores toward white people, resident physicians with burnout had greater explicit racial bias (difference in FT score, –2.40; 95% CI, –3.42 to –1.37; P?.001) and implicit racial bias (difference in IAT score, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P?=?.002). A dose-response association was found between change in depersonalization from R2 to R3 Questionnaire and R3 Questionnaire explicit bias (for each 1-point increase the difference in R3 FT score decreased, –0.73; 95% CI, –1.23 to –0.23; P?=?.004) and change in explicit bias. Conclusions and Relevance Among resident physicians, symptoms of burnout appeared to be associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases; given the high prevalence of burnout and the negative implications of bias for medical care, symptoms of burnout may be factors in racial disparities in health care.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 3,0.02033825384412713,False,

Research suggests that such derogation of deviant ingroup members aims to restore the image of the group by symbolically excluding so-called ?black sheeps?. We hypothesized that information about a harm-doer?s group membership influences observers? justice-seeking reactions. Motives for punishment vary on the basis of whether the goal is to punish past harm-doing (i.e., retributive motives), help harm-doers recognize the harm inflicted and reintegrate into society (i.e., restorative motives), or control harm-doer?s future behavior through incapacitating practices and exclusion from society (i.e., utilitarian motives). We hypothesized that immoral behaviors by ingroup rather than outgroup members jeopardize the group?s reputation and therefore activate utilitarian (i.e., exclusion-oriented) motives for punishment. Study 1 (N=187) confirmed that people displayed more utilitarian motives and less restorative motives when sanctioning an ingroup as opposed to an outgroup harm-doer.

Participants displayed stronger utilitarian (i.e., exclusion-oriented) punishment motives when the harm-doer was presented as a typical ingroup rather than an outgroup member. Study 3 (N = 292) replicated the findings of Studies 1 and 2 and further showed that people displayed stronger utilitarian punishments against an ingroup offender through the experience of increased identity threat. Contrary to our expectations, observers? ingroup identification did not moderate the effect of group membership or typicality to the ingroup on justice reactions. Yet, ingroup identification influenced both experienced identity threat (i.e., mediator) and utilitarian motives for punishment with high identifiers experiencing higher threat and displaying stronger utilitarian punishment motive.

Study 1 examines over 500,000 tweets from over 160,000 Twitter users about 46 unambiguously successful targets varying in race (white, black) and gender (male, female)—American gold medalists from the 2016 Olympics. Leveraging advances in computational social science, we identify tweeters’ political ideology, race, and gender. Tweets from political liberals were much more likely than those from conservatives to be about successful black (vs. white) and female (vs. male) gold medalists (and especially black females), controlling for tweeters’ own race and gender, and even when tweeters themselves were white or male (i.e., advantaged group members). Studies 2 and 3 provided experimental evidence that liberals are more likely than conservatives to differentially amplify successful members of disadvantaged (vs. advantaged) groups and suggested that this is driven by liberals’ heightened concern with social equality.

Approaches to estimating a groupâ€™s future lethality often require data on the groupâ€™s capabilities and resources, but by the nature of the phenomenon, these data are intentionally concealed by the organizations themselves via encryption, the dark web, back-channel financing, and misinformation. Here, we present a statistical model for estimating a terror groupâ€™s future lethality using latent-variable modeling techniques to infer a groupâ€™s intrinsic capabilities and resources for inflicting harm. The analysis introduces 2 explanatory variables that are strong predictors of lethality and raise the overall explained variance when added to existing models. The explanatory variables generate a unique early-warning signal of an individual groupâ€™s future lethality based on just a few of its first attacks. Relying on the first 10 to 20 attacks or the first 10 to 20% of a groupâ€™s lifetime behavior, our model explains about 60% of the variance in a groupâ€™s future lethality as would be explained by a groupâ€™s complete lifetime data.

https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/academics-research/research/detail/2019/up-or-down-the-price-effects-of-market-intermediary/,Up Or Down The Price Effects Of Market Intermediary,David Dranove; Dov Rothman; David Toniatti,2019,"Intermediaries purchase from input suppliers and sell to consumers. Given the positioning of intermediaries in the middle of supply chains, the impact of a merger of intermediaries on the prices in output markets may depend on the impact of the merger in input markets, and vice versa. Making sense of a merger of intermediaries therefore requires a comprehensive analysis that ties together the potential effects in both sides of the market. Suppose that a merger of two intermediaries allows them to obtain cognizable input price reductions. An antitrust claim against this merger might focus on the input price effect. But it is more than likely that the claim would also consider the impact on output prices. In this paper, we show how to adapt the widely used Upward Pricing Pressure (UPP) methodology to study this problem. As in Ho and Lee (2017), we tailor the model to situations where intermediaries bargain with upstream suppliers. This characterizes the upstream healthcare market, in which insurers bargain with providers, but is also common in other markets, such as cable, construction, and apparel. It is important to distinguish bargaining markets from traditional posted price upstream markets. In traditional monopsony markets, the monopsonist restricts input purchases, which necessarily leads to output restrictions and higher consumer prices. When bargaining occurs in upstream markets, powerful intermediaries may secure lower prices from input suppliers without necessarily restricting the amount of inputs that they purchase. We develop a model that accounts for a merger’s impact on bargaining leverage with input suppliers as well as the merger’s impact on sell-side market power, and the interactions between the two sides. We consider two ways in which a merged intermediary might negotiate with a supplier: separate or all-or-nothing bargaining. In separate bargaining, if the intermediary fails to reach an agreement with one of the input suppliers, the input supplier may still contract with the other merged intermediary. In the all-or-nothing bargaining, if the intermediary fails to reach an agreement with one of the input suppliers, the supplier cannot contract with either intermediary. Under separate bargaining, we find that without cognizable cost reductions unrelated to the input price, increased bargaining leverage cannot offset the upward price pressure from the loss of sell-side competition. Under all-or-nothing bargaining, however, we find that the direction and magnitude of the output price effect depends on substitution patterns and market power. Downward pressure on input prices from increased bargaining leverage can offset upward pressure on output prices if input suppliers have a lot of market power relative to the merging intermediaries prior to the merger, and consumer substitution between the merging intermediaries and non-merging intermediaries is low. Otherwise, increased bargaining leverage does not offset the upward price pressure from the loss of sell-side competition. There are three main conclusions from our analysis. First, when input and output market interactions are considered together, the amount of substitution or diversion between the merging intermediaries is less important. This is because the effect of diversion between the merging intermediaries on the buy-side and sell-side largely cancels itself out. Higher diversion between the merging intermediaries means larger increases in sell-side and buy-side market power. Second, under all-or-nothing bargaining, the amount of substitution or diversion between the merged intermediary and other intermediaries is important. A merger of intermediaries is more likely to result in a lower output price if substitution between the merged intermediary and other intermediaries is low. This is because if substitution between the merged intermediary and other intermediaries is low, the merger will result in a larger shift in bargaining leverage, and therefore more downward pressure on the merged intermediary’s input price. Third, under all-or-nothing bargaining, how market power is distributed along the supply chain prior to the merger is important. A merger of intermediaries is more likely to result in a lower output price when the intermediary and input markets are both concentrated prior to the merger. In this case, the merged intermediary uses its additional “countervailing” buyer power to eat into the sellers’ high margins, which puts downward pressure on the merged intermediary’s input price and translates into lower output prices.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 2,0.01407065070012981,False,

As a consequence, anger (but not sadness or fear) may result in both less susceptibility to contextual choice biases and greater post-choice satisfaction.

Further, the small size of patient populations for orphan drugs, together with the increasing prevalence of biologics among orphan drugs, have created a set of natural monopoly-like markets in which firms face little competition, even after the end of formal periods of patent protection and market exclusivity. Additionally, the evolving technologies of drug development—in particular, the increasingly common use of auxiliary endpoints in clinical trials and the use of biomarkers for patient selection for treatment—now allow manufacturers to target smaller populations. Taken together, these changes raise doubts about whether the ODA encourages the development of products that otherwise would not have been brought to market—or whether, instead, it simply rewards the producers of inframarginal products.

The smaller the Medicare program is relative to the commercial market, the less important this is; but in a world where there are no market prices or the private sector is very small, the task of setting prices that are dynamically correct becomes more complex. Reforming Medicare should focus on greater incentives to increase competition between Medicare Advantage plans, which necessitates a role for government in ensuring competition; premium support; less use of regulated prices; and less appetite for countless â€œpay for performanceâ€ schemes.

We model the queueing primitives via polyhedral uncertainty sets inspired by the limit laws of probability. These uncertainty sets are characterized by variability parameters that control the degree of conservatism of the model. Assuming the inter-arrival and service times belong to such uncertainty sets, we obtain closed-form expressions for the worst case transient system time in multi-server queues and feed-forward networks with deterministic routing. These analytic formulas offer rich qualitative insights on the dependence of the system times as a function of the variability parameters and the fundamental quantities in the queueing system. To approximate the average behavior, we treat the variability parameters as random variables and infer their density by using ideas from queues in heavy traffic under reflected Brownian motion. We then average the worst case values obtained with respect to the variability parameters. Our averaging approach yields approximations that match the diffusion approximations for a single queue with light-tailed primitives and allows us to extend the framework to heavy-tailed feed-forward networks. Our methodology achieves significant computational tractability and provides accurate approximations for the expected system time relative to simulated values.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 3,0.004433677489768172,False,

We document several new facts on product reallocation. First, every quarter around 8 percent of products are reallocated in the economy, and the entry and exit of products are prevalent among different types of firms. Second, most reallocation of products occurs within the boundaries of the firm. The entries and exits of firms only make a small contribution in the overall creation and destruction of products. Third, product reallocation is strongly pro-cyclical and declined by more than 25 percent during the Great Recession. This cyclical pattern is almost entirely explained by a decline in within firm reallocation. Motivated by these facts, we study the causes and consequences of reallocation within incumbent firms. As predicted by Schumpeterian growth theories, the rate of product reallocation strongly depends on the innovation efforts of the firms and has important implications for revenue growth, improvements in products’ quality, and productivity dynamics. Our estimates suggest that the decline in product reallocation through these margins has contributed greatly to the slow growth experienced after the Great Recession.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 8,0.03400914949611428,False,

A CLP, such as Plenti introduced by American Express in 2015, is a third-party program that lets its customers accrue points by transacting at a variety of businesses and retailers, and customers can redeem rewards from the CLP when they have enough points. In this research, using a natural experimental setting, we investigate tactics that a CLP can implement to encourage customers’ participation through point accruals and reward redemptions. We propose that a CLP can stimulate existing customers’ participation by providing information and reward convenience. By analyzing a unique dataset, we find that the additions of a mobile app (information convenience) and a point-of-sales (POS) redemption structure (reward convenience) increase accruals and redemptions for those who adopt them, particularly for occasional customers who previously accrue at a below-average level and rarely redeem. We also find that the two tactics are synergistic for customers who previously accrue at an above-average level but rarely redeem. As for active customers, information and reward convenience encourage further redemptions, which reduces a CLP’s liability. Finally, we posit that customers follow the “Principle of Least Effort” and show that they tend to accrue the additional points by spending on convenient, high-penetration categories in light of information and reward convenience. From our findings, we recommend that a CLP should invest in increasing its convenience proposition such as building a mobile app or allowing POS redemptions to encourage customers’ continuing participation.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 9,0.01061939015457247,False,

Labor market frictions make financing labor different than financing capital. Unlike capital, labor cannot be owned and can act strategically. Workers face unemployment costs, can negotiate for higher wages, are protected by employment regulations, and face retirement risk. I propose using these frictions as a framework for understanding the unique impact of a firm’s workforce on its capital structure. For instance, high leverage often makes managing labor more difficult by undermining employees’ job security and increasing the need for costly workforce reductions. But firms can also use leverage to their advantage, such as in labor negotiations and defined benefit pensions.

Second, when people pursue a goal to obtain internal rewards (process focus or intrinsic motivation), the degree to which an activity is closely associated or fused with the goal increases their motivation. Third, when people pursue a goal to maintain a positive self-concept (self-signaling), their motivation is mainly a function of the extent to which they can make internal attributions for their goal-related actions and their expectations that they will remember these actions. We review empirical evidence from psychology and consumer research in support of each of these sources of motivation and discuss the theoretical and practical implications of distinguishing between these sources.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 9,0.005057159508602473,False,

Keeping leverage constant while retiring bank debt would expose firms to a higher risk of financial distress; they offset this by reducing total borrowing.

Yet employees often have discretion to deviate from their prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses, we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time). Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors? queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the trade-offs between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling should be delegated.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 8,0.01153975425548924,False,

The current work examines whether members of an ethnic minority group, Black Americans, also associate Black-White multiracials more with their minority versus majority parent group and if so, why. The first two studies (1A and 1B) directly compared Black and White Americans, and found that although both Blacks and Whites categorized Black-White multiracials as more Black than White, Whites' use of hypodescent was associated with intergroup anti- egalitarianism, whereas Blacks' use of hypodescent was associated with intergroup egalitarianism. Studies 2-3 reveal that egalitarian Blacks use hypodescent in part because they perceive that Black-White biracials face discrimination and consequently feel a sense of linked fate with them.

Sheehy-Skeffington; Arnold Ho,2017,"Debate surrounding the issue of inequality and hierarchy between social groups has become increasingly prominent in recent years. At the same time, individuals disagree about the extent to which inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged groups exists. Whereas prior work has examined the ways in which individuals legitimize (or delegitimize) inequality as a function of their motivations, we consider whether individuals’ orientation towards group-based hierarchy motivates the extent to which they perceive inequality between social groups in the first place. Across 8 studies in both real- world (race, gender, and class) and artificial contexts, and involving members of both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, we show that the more individuals endorse hierarchy between groups, the less they perceive inequality between groups at the top and groups at the bottom. Perceiving less inequality is associated with rejecting egalitarian social policies aimed at reducing it. We show that these differences in hierarchy perception as a function of individuals’ motivational orientation hold even when inequality is depicted abstractly using images, and even when individuals are financially incentivized to accurately report their true perceptions. Using a novel methodology to assess accurate memory of hierarchy, we find that differences may be driven by both anti-egalitarians underestimating inequality, and egalitarians overestimating it. In sum, our results identify a novel perceptual bias rooted in individuals’ chronic motivations towards hierarchy-maintenance, with the potential to influence their policy attitudes.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 10,0.2000707380692479,True,disadvantaged groups; ethnic inequality; political inequality; racial inequality; social inequality

Objective: To determine the association between hospitalist total daily processing time per patient and the size and evolution over the patient’s length of stay (LOS) of the digital and physical teams as well as patient-level characteristics. Design: We measured hospitalist daily processing times and captured the physical team through a time-and-motion study of hospitalists. e digital team interactions were extracted from patient Electronic Health Records. Setting: Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a large academic urban hospital in Chicago. Participants Our case study selected four hospitalists at random who cared for 107 inpatient stays over 17 days in June-July 2014 and collaborated with 2046 caregivers: 301 were observed physical collaborators and 1745 were digital-only collaborators. Exposures: Hospitalist activities and patient encounters from observations and electronic health records. Main Outcomes and Measures: Processing time is the total time spent by the hospitalist on a patient’s care per day. Key covariates are patient-level characteristics, interruptions by physical team members, and size and evolution of both the digital and physical teams. Results Teamwork interaction and patient-level characteristics explain 72% (18.9min) and 28% (7.2min), respectively, of the hospitalist’s average patient processing time of 26.7min per day. Teamwork is further decomposed in two ways: (i) 18.9 = 15.4 + 3.5 where 15.4min and 3.5min captures the teamwork e ect at a macro level (driven by team size and stability variables) and micro level e ect (hospitalist work ow interruptions driven by task switches), respectively; (ii) 18.9 = 8.8 + 10.1 where 8.8min and 10.1min capture digital and physical team variables, respectively. As a benchmark, eliminating interruptions reduces processing times by 3.5min (13%) while minimizing team size and maximizing team stability reduces processing times by 7.8min (29%). Conclusion and Relevance: Hospitalist processing times are impacted as much by the digital as the physical care team characteristics. Although our ndings should be validated in di erent clinical settings, they suggest the need to combine digital data with observational data to evaluate hospitalist processing times and to mitigate the negative e ects of interruptions and care team turnover.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 3,0.03265056145668691,False,

In recent years, many retailers have added exclusively sourced factory outlet stores into their channel mix to achieve market expansion and customer segmentation. However, the impact of adoption of this lower-quality, lower-price alternative channel on spending at the retailer's higher-quality, higher-price retail store channel is not clear. Customers adopting the outlet channel might increase their spending in the retail store channel due to the opportunity to become familiar with the brand at a lower price point or transfer of positive associations formed through patronage of the outlet channel to the store channel. Customers adopting the lower quality channel might also decrease their spending in the retail store channel due to brand dilution or cannibalization. In order to investigate this issue, we use a unique individual level panel data set from a specialty apparel retailer from a period during which it opened many factory outlet stores. This allows us to study how purchase behavior changes after customers adopt the outlet channel while carefully controlling for alternative explanations including customer heterogeneity and selection effects. We find that although customers who adopt the outlet channel spend less with the retailer compared to store-only customers, the difference cannot be attributed to the impact of adoption of the outlet channel. After controlling for heterogeneity and selection effects, we uncover a positive spillover to the retail store channel from adoption of the outlet channel. Customers who adopt the outlet channel not only make incremental purchases at the outlet channel but also increase their spending in the retail store channel after adoption.

How decision makers learn by trial and error and the efficacy of the process, therefore, are inextricably linked to the incentives of the decision makers themselves and, in particular, to their tolerance for risk. In this paper we develop a model of trial and error learning with risk averse agents who learn by observing the choices of earlier agents and the outcomes that are realized. We identify sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal actions. We show that behavior within each period varies in risk and performance and that a knowledge trap develops, such that low performing agents opt to not experiment and thus fail to gain the knowledge necessary to improve performance. We also show that the impact of risk reverberates across periods. We identify a causal loop between performance, risk aversion, and experimentation that leads to divergence in long-run performance across agents. This implies that initial differences matter and have a long run impact on performance.

If not, which hospitals are left behind, and what are the challenges? Since hospitals are benchmarked against their peers under the policy, we use a game-theoretical model to describe hospitals' behavior. While the game is complex, we develop bounds on equilibria that provide insights into the effectiveness of the HRRP policy. We calibrate our model with a dataset of hospitals in California. Our model suggests that in the long term, a significant proportion of hospitals will prefer to pay penalties rather than reduce readmissions. For a broad range of parameters, we find that the policy may be ineffective in inducing some hospitals to reduce readmissions: these are hospitals that either (i) are located in sparsely served areas, (ii) have a low fraction of revenue coming from Medicare, (iii) have currently high readmission rates, or (iv) have a high contribution margin per patient.

After outlining key tenets of cultural mismatch theory, we draw on Gelfand and Harrington’s (IN PRESS) discussion of the factors that increase the motivational force of norms. We argue that these same factors characterize underrepresented groups’ experiences of cultural mismatches, which should increase their reliance on norms. Next, drawing on Morris and Liu’s (2014) distinction between peer and aspirational norms, we argue that the consequences of increased reliance on norms for experiences of cultural mismatch depend on whether underrepresented groups rely on peer versus aspirational norms.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 10,0.02850333400744098,False,economic inequality; ethnic inequality; income inequality; political inequality; racial inequality; social inequality

Local sourcing is receiving more attention, but it remains challenging to balance the offshore sourcing cost advantage against the increased inventories, because of its longer lead time, and against the cost and (volume) flexibility of each source’s capacity. To guide strategic allocation in this global network decision, this paper establishes reasonably simple prescriptions that capture the key drivers. We adopt a conventional discrete-time inventory model with a linear control rule that smoothes orders and allows an exact and analytically tractable analysis of single- and dual-sourcing policies under normal demand. Distinguishing features of our model are that it captures each source’s lead time, capacity cost, and flexibility to work overtime. We use Lagrange’s inversion theorem to provide exact and simple square-root bound formulae for the strategic sourcing allocations and the value of dual sourcing. The formulae provide structural insight on the impact of financial, operational, and demand parameters, and a starting point for quantitative decision making.

Although differential access to resources contributes to inequality, the current review illuminates how ongoing participation in different social class contexts also gives rise to culture-specific selves and patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting. We integrate a growing body of interdisciplinary research to reveal how social class culture cycles operate over the course of the lifespan and through critical gateway contexts, including homes, schools, and workplaces. We first document how each of these contexts socializes social class cultural differences. Then, we demonstrate how these gateway institutions, which could provide access to upward social mobility, are structured according to middle-class ways of being a self and thus can fuel and perpetuate inequality.

We propose that when individuals face an attribute change, they use a deliberative and effortful response, known as System 2, to detect the change. However, they rely less on this system to evaluate the changed options. Instead, a more automatic System 1 processing influences their decision by making them apply the bigger-is-better heuristic (bigger-is-worse for an undesirable change) to prefer the option with the highest (lowest) absolute magnitude of change.

Strong approximations provide such limitless approximations for process dynamics. Our focus here is on steady-state distributions and the diffusion model that we propose is tractable relative to strong approximations. Within an asymptotic framework, in which a scale parameter n is taken large, a uniform (in the scale parameter) Lyapunov condition is proved to guarantee that the gap between steady-state moments of the diffusion and those of the properly centered and scaled CTMCs, shrinks at a rate of v n. The uniform Lyapunov requirement is satisfied, in particular, if the scaled and centered sequence converges to a diffusion limit for which a Lyapunov condition is satisfied. Our proofs build on gradient estimates for the solutions of the Poisson equations associated with the (sequence of) diffusion models together with elementary Martingale arguments.

To gauge the potential demand, a service firm often allows each customer to reserve a unit of service in advance. However, to avoid the loss associated with “no-shows”, service firms may require a non-refundable deposit. To determine an optimal reservation policy with a non-refundable deposit, we consider the case in which the market is divided into four segments (high vs. low valuation and high vs. low show-up probability). When customer demand and the firm's capacity are large so that they can be approximated by continuous values, we determine the optimal reservation policy analytically, and we establish analytical conditions under which the firm should discriminate against (i.e., price out) certain customer segments. For the case when customer demand and the firm's capacity are finite so that they take on discrete values, we find that some of the insights obtained from the “continuous” case continue to hold especially when the firm's capacity is large. However, the key difference is that in the former case, the firm discriminates mostly based on customers' valuation, whereas in the latter case it discriminates mostly based on customers' show-up probability.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.01973047458919441,False,

We provide an explanation for this puzzle: Bidding in sealed bid auctions for new issues is complex, particularly when the underlying shares are difficult to value and the auction is open to large numbers of potential bidders, some of whom might be naïve. Participation fluctuations make it difficult for even sophisticated bidders to shave accurately for the winner’s curse, and mistakes by some bidders impose costs on all.

First, firms with a higher fraction of growth opportunities in the firm value (high-growth firms) exhibit risk premia different from those of firms with fewer growth opportunities (low-growth firms). Second, high-growth firms co-move with each other, giving rise to a systematic factor in stock returns distinct from the market portfolio and related to the value factor. Third, stock return betas with respect to the IST shocks reveal cross-sectional heterogeneity in firms' growth opportunities. We find empirical support for qualitative predictions of the model.

Illiquidity leads to under-investment in both the liquid and illiquid risky asset, relative to the standard Merton (1969) case. We demonstrate that the effect of illiquidity can be quantitatively large, because in contrast to transaction costs models, the shadow cost of illiquidity is unbounded.

We develop a framework to guide government policy in response to a crisis, where government may intervene to support distressed mortgages. Our results emphasize three aspects of efficient mortgage modifications. First, when households are borrowing constrained, government resources should support household liquidity up-front. This implies loan modifications that reduce payments during the crisis, rather than using government resources to reduce payments over the life of the mortgage contract, such as via debt reduction. Second, while governments will not find it efficient to directly write down borrower debt, in many cases it will be in the best interest of lenders to write down debt. Reducing debt is effective in reducing strategic default. Lenders, who bear credit default risk, have a direct incentive to write down debt and avoid losses due to default. Finally, a well-designed mortgage contract should take these considerations into account, reducing payments during recessions and reducing debt when home prices fall. We propose an automatic stabilizer mortgage contract which does both, by refinancing mortgages into lower-rate adjustable rate mortgages when interest rates fall during a downturn -- reducing payments and lowering the present value of borrowers' debt.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.04078300828963412,False,debt restructuring

This paper introduces a new measurement tool, Comparative Method of Valuation (CMV), that, unlike prior efforts to measure WTP, is designed to account for the inherently comparative and situational nature of WTP. Across nine studies reported in the paper and four additional studies in the Web Appendix, the authors examine differences in results between CMV and conjoint as well as between CMV and the classic Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) methodology, demonstrate the CMV as a valid and reliable measure of WTP, and illustrate applications of the CMV to managerial problems. In total, this paper offers both conceptual clarity and methodological advances to understanding the construction and measurement of WTP for practitioners and academics alike.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.005555748838587525,False,

We use the model to study capital asset pricing and reallocation, as well as optimal consumption and investment decisions. With two sectors, the consumer balances diversification against the potential productivity and efficiency gains of investing more heavily in one sector. The general framework nests and extends standard equilibrium macro-asset pricing models. We show conditions under which aggregates are immune to the distribution of capital and in contrast, when the distribution becomes crucial for both sectoral and aggregate values. Applications of the framework highlight the importance of heterogeneity and capital liquidity - the ability to reallocate capital - for economic growth and asset pricing. Misallocated capital creates risk and reduces utility, but correcting it through capital reallocation reduces efficiency and growth.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 8,0.03545552395934195,False,economic diversification

This induces an interpolation error which, since 2014, could be sizable and especially pertinent under stressed market conditions. We quantify the VIX interpolation errors and identify underlying sources. We show the change to include weekly options for the VIX calculation in 2014 led to a tenfold error reduction, eliminating them as a practical concern. Thus, the gap between the old and new VIX measure is a good proxy for the interpolation error. Moreover, the new Cboe VIX calculation is not backdated, so the series displays different statistical properties before and after 2014. Our analysis is relevant for a broad set of VIX-style indices worldwide, since nearly all such measures are computed exclusively from monthly options. In addition, there is growing interest in shorter-horizon VIX indices, and for such measures the interpolation errors amplify notably. Our analysis facilitates assessment of these errors and offers guidance for new robust computational algorithms. We exemplify this via an analysis of the 9-day VIX index. Finally, we compare the interpolation scheme for VIX to a pair of existing alternatives also based on monthly options. We find that such modifications can reduce the average errors, but they are neither uniformly superior nor do they resolve the basic issue satisfactorily.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 1,0.006772484164483467,False,

Previous studies highlight that individual differences in ideological orientations predicting a range of intergroup attitudes—namely, social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA)—also predict support for ethnic miming. We propose that blatant dehumanization of the target groups is an underlying mechanism that helps to further explain why support for ethnic miming is stronger among individuals higher in SDO and RWA. Studies from the Netherlands (Study 1) and the United States (Study 2) provide support for this notion. Method: The samples consisted of participants residing in the Netherlands (N= 142; Study 1) and the United States (N= 298; Study 2), the majority of whom identified as part of the dominant ethnic group (82% ethnically Dutch, Study 1; 76% White American, Study 2). We used both mediation and cluster analyses to test our hypotheses. Results: The mediation analyses reveal indirect effects from each of SDO and RWA to support for ethnic miming via blatant dehumanization. Additionally, the cluster analyses reveal that although some individuals who support ethnic miming have relatively egalitarian attitudes, others have attitudes that arguably reflect a sense of cultural superiority and preference for cultural dominance (i.e., high SDO, RWA, and blatant dehumanization). Conclusion: The findings suggest that a sense of cultural superiority and preference for cultural dominance helps to explain why support for ethnic miming persists in both cultural contexts.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 10,0.01749265785873221,False,

The PMA process includes a detailed scientific, regulatory and quality system review and is critical to ensure that novel devices are safe, effective, and meet the needs of patients. Objective: To survey current voting members serving on panels of the FDA’s Medical Devices Advisory Committee to better characterize panel decision-making and identify steps for improvement. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative survey study included 36 questions that were mailed to FDA device panelists regarding their opinions on the influence of sources of information, pivotal trial design, quality of evidence, panel composition and internal deliberative process, time allocation, and impartiality of the FDA. The survey was mailed to the members of all 18 FDA device panels in January and February 2017. Data were collected from January to May 2017 and analyzed from 2018 to 2019. Exposures: Respondents read and returned the aforementioned paper survey, while nonrespondents did not. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes included panel members’ perceptions, and their implications for process improvement. ?2 or Fisher exact tests were used to test differences between subgroups. Results: Of 64 of 92 panel members who responded (69.6%), 38 of 64 (59.4%) were male, 3 of 63 (4.8%) were Black respondents, 46 of 63 (73.0%) were White respondents, and 36 of 60 (60.0%) were in academic practice. The mean (range) panel service was 6.8 (1-22) years with 3.9 (1-19) meetings attended. Overall, respondents considered information presented by the FDA unbiased, and 28 of 61 (45.9%) believed that pivotal trials were frequently well-designed, 55 of 62 respondents (88.7%) suggested FDA consult panel members preemptively regarding trial design and 54 of 64 (84.4%) regarding the device label. Most indicated that prior FDA approval of another device serving the same medical purpose (43 of 62 [69.4%]) or approval in other countries with comparable regulatory regimes, such as Canada and Europe (39 of 62 [62.9%]), would make them more likely to recommend approval. Respondents rated written information (50 of 60 [83.3%]), live presentations (43 of 58 [74.1%]), and prior professional knowledge (41 of 60 [68.3%]) as the most important sources of information in deciding whether to recommend approval. Additionally, 52 of 58 respondents (89.7%) recommended that a panel member–only executive session would allow more clarity and honesty in deliberations, and 33 of 59 (55.9%) believed a three-fourths majority appropriate for recommending approval, which would be a deviation from the current system in which an overall vote is reported without designation of a vote threshold. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of FDA device panel members, respondents wanted improved study designs, more relevant clinical data, including from other countries, involvement of panelists in study design and device label development, and inclusion of an executive session.

Van Mieghem,2025,"We investigate how volume flexibility, defined by a sourcing cost premium beyond a base capacity, at a local responsive supplier impacts the decision to reshore supply. The buyer also has access to a remote supplier that is cheaper with no restrictions on volume flexibility. We show that with unit lead time difference between both suppliers, the optimal dual sourcing policy is a modified dual base-stock policy with three base-stock levels Sf1, Sf2, and Ss. The replenishment orders are generated by first placing a base order from the fast supplier of at most k units to raise the inventory position to Sf1, if that is possible. After this base order, if the adjusted inventory position is still below Sf2, additional units are ordered from the fast supplier at an overtime premium to reach Sf2. Finally, if the adjusted inventory position is below Ss, an order from the slow supplier is placed to bring the final inventory position to Ss. Surprisingly, in contrast to single sourcing with limited volume flexibility, a more complex dual sourcing model often results in a “simpler” policy that replaces demand in each period. The latter allows analytical insights into the sourcing split between the responsive and the remote supplier. Our analysis shows how increased volume flexibility at the responsive supplier promotes the decision to reshore operations and effectively serves as a cost benefit. It also shows how investing in base capacity or additional volume flexibility act as strategic substitutes.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 12,0.01084557988365231,False,

There is a debate in the literature about why people spread misinformation and what should be done about it. According to the purely cognitive account, people largely spread misinformation because they are lazy, not biased. According to a motivational account, people are also motivated to believe and spread misinformation for ideological and partisan reasons. To better understand the psychological and neurocognitive processes that underlie misinformation sharing among the far-right, we conducted a cross-cultural experiment with conservatives and far-right partisans in the Unites States and Spain (N = 1,609) and a neuroimaging study with far-right partisans in Spain (N = 36). Far-right partisans in Spain and U.S. Republicans who highly identify with Trump were more likely to share misinformation than center-right voters and other Republicans, especially when the misinformation was related to sacred values (e.g., immigration). Sacred values predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond familiarity, attitude strength, and salience of the issue. Moreover, far-right partisans were unresponsive to fact-checking and accuracy nudges. At a neural level, this group showed increased activity in brain regions implicated in mentalizing and norm compliance in response to posts with sacred values. These results suggest that the two components of political devotion—identity fusion and sacred values—play a key role in misinformation sharing, highlighting the identity-affirming dimension of misinformation sharing.

Yet claims that “virtue signaling” is fueling a culture of outrage suggest that reputation concerns may inspire even potentially unmerited punishment. Moreover, might reputation do more to drive punishment in ambiguous situations, where punishment is less clearly deserved, eroding punishers’ sensitivity to moral nuance? Across eight studies focused on the U.S. political context (total n = 15,472 Americans from MTurk and Prolific), we show that reputation can drive ambiguously-deserved punishment. In situations involving politicized moral transgressions, including those where the case for punishing the transgressor is judged to be relatively ambiguous, subjects expect punishers to be perceived positively by co-partisans, and punish at higher rates when punishing is observable to a co-partisan audience. Moreover, reputation can drive punishment in ambiguous situations even among individuals who personally question the morality of punishment, highlighting the power of reputation to push people away from their values. Yet we find no evidence that reputation erodes sensitivity to nuance by doing more to drive punishment in more ambiguous situations. Instead, subjects expect punishment to look better when more unambiguously deserved, and making punishment observable does as much or more to drive punishment in unambiguous than ambiguous situations—even when the co-partisan audience is strongly ideological (and so might have been expected to encourage undiscerning punishment). We thus suggest that reputation can make people more punitive, even in ambiguous situations, but does not diminish sensitivity to nuance.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 5,0.00381320500628566,False,

But humans also identify strongly with groups. Concerns about group-based reputation may similarly shape people’s psychology, perhaps especially in contexts where shifts in group reputation can have strategic consequences. Do individuals allow their concern with their group’s reputation to shape their reactions to even large-scale societal suffering versus benefits? Examining both affective responses and financially incentivized behavior of partisans in the United States, five preregistered experiments (N = 7,534) demonstrate that group-based reputational incentives can weaken—and sometimes nearly eliminate—affective differentiation between present-term societal harms and benefits. This can occur even when these societal harms and benefits are substantial—including economic devastation and national security threats—and when the consequences impact ingroup members. Individuals’ sensitivity to group-based reputation can even cause them to divert resources from more effective to less effective charities. We provide evidence that partisans care about group-based reputation in part because it holds strategic value, positioning their group to improve its standing vis-a-vis the outgroup.

The limiting behavior of the test statistic is governed by unobservable latent factors in the asset prices. The critical values of the test are constructed on the basis of a novel simulation-based procedure. Empirical implementation of the test to stocks in the S&P 500 index and the five Fama-French factors, as well as the momentum factor, reveals different intraday behavior of the factor loadings: assets’ exposure to size, market and value risks vary systematically over the trading day while the three remaining factors do not exhibit statistically significant intraday variation.

Using a proprietary dataset on billing code applications for emerging medical procedures, we highlight two mechanisms that could hinder innovation. First, the administrative hurdle of securing permanent, reimbursable billing codes substantially delays innovation diffusion. We find that Medicare utilization of innovative procedures increases nearly nine-fold after the billing codes are promoted to permanent (reimbursable) from provisional (non-reimbursable). However, only 29 percent of the provisional codes are promoted within the five-year probation period. Second, medical procedures lack intellectual property rights, especially those without patented devices. When appropriability is limited, specialty medical societies lead the applications for billing codes. We indicate that the ad hoc process for securing billing codes for procedure innovations creates uncertainty about both the development process and the allocation and enforceability of property rights. This stands in stark contrast to the more deliberate regulatory oversight for pharmaceutical innovations.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 5,0.02104094355391098,False,

The current article moves beyond the single-level focus of prior theories of workplace bias to propose a novel theoretical model that conceptualizes workplace bias as a multilevel cycle. First, we discuss the theoretical foundations of our bias cycle theory and describe why understanding the nature of workplace bias--and effectively reducing it--requires considering the reciprocal influences of both individual and organizational levels of the cycle. Specifically, we describe how workplace bias operates as a cycle and then propose that successfully reducing workplace bias requires multilevel interventions that interrupt bias across both the individual and organizational levels of the cycle. Second, because workplace bias is reproduced through both of these levels, we review and bring together literatures that are often considered separately: psychology research on reducing bias at the individual level and sociology and management research on reducing bias at the organizational level. Third, we use our bias cycle theory to formulate general principles for determining how to begin and how to pair interventions across levels.

But are these observations related? Does reputation drive people to people to “punish without looking”? And if so, is this because unquestioning punishment looks particularly virtuous? To investigate, we assigned “Actors” to decide whether to sign punitive petitions about politicized issues (“punishment”), after first deciding whether to read articles opposing these petitions (“looking”). To manipulate reputation, we matched Actors with co- partisan “Evaluators”, varying whether Evaluators observed (i) nothing about Actors’ behavior, (ii) whether Actors punished, or (iii) whether Actors punished and whether they looked. Across four studies of Americans (total n = 10,343), Evaluators rated Actors more positively, and financially rewarded them, if they chose to (vs. not to) punish. Correspondingly, making punishment observable to Evaluators (i.e., moving from our first to second condition) drove Actors to punish more overall. Furthermore, because some of these individuals did not look, making punishment observable increased rates of punishment without looking. Yet punishers who eschewed opposing perspectives did not appear particularly virtuous. In fact, Evaluators preferred Actors who punished with (vs. without) looking. Correspondingly, making looking observable (i.e., moving from our second to third condition) drove Actors to look more overall—and to punish without looking at comparable or diminished rates. We thus find that reputation can encourage reflexive punishment—but simply as a byproduct of generally encouraging punishment, and not as a specific reputational strategy. Indeed, rather than fueling unquestioning decisions, spotlighting punishers’ decision-making processes may encourage reflection.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 5,0.007451215151931419,False,

Previous research has largely attributed this unwillingness to the perception that such counterattitudinal targets are extreme, certain, and/or difficult to change on these topics. However, the present research offers an additional theoretical explanation. First, we introduce a less studied perception of targets, their affective-cognitive attitude basis (i.e., the degree to which an attitude is seemingly based on emotions versus reasons) that is critical in determining engagement willingness. Specifically, perceivers are less willing to engage with targets who are perceived to hold an affective (vs. cognitive) attitude basis on a topic, because these targets are inferred to have low attitudinal openness on it (i.e., expected to be unlikely to genuinely “hear out” the perceiver). Second, we use a series of multimethod studies with varied U.S. samples to show why this person perception process is central to understanding counterattitudinal engagement. Compared to proattitudinal targets, perceivers on both sides of an issue ascribe more affective (vs. cognitive) attitude bases to rival (counterattitudinal) targets, which cues inferences of reduced attitudinal openness, thereby diminishing people’s willingness to engage with these individuals",Official Website,100.0,Goal 13,0.009128004153830173,False,

While science is heavily supported by public funding, common depictions suggest that scientific research remains an isolated or ‘ivory tower’ activity, with weak connectivity to public uses and little correspondence between the funding of science and its public interest. Here we integrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific publications from all scientific fields to their upstream funding support and downstream public uses across three public domains -- government documents, the news media, and marketplace invention. By analyzing how scientific knowledge is consumed beyond science, we uncover three key findings. (1) Scientific fields find individually specialized yet collectively diverse usage in public domains; some fields dominate in government documents, others in the news media, and yet others in downstream invention. (2) Public usage universally emphasizes high-impact science; across all fields and each public domain, the papers that receive attention tend to be highly cited by scientists themselves, showing substantial alignment between what the public consumes and what is impactful within science. (3) The funding of science across fields is sharply predictable based on its combined use in the three public domains we studied, documenting a remarkable yet previously unknown consistency between public investment and public uses of science. Overall, public uses of science present a rich landscape of specialized consumption, yet collectively there is remarkable, quantifiable alignment between public use, scientific use, and science funding.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.03688040489967602,False,

This research investigates the influence of a central aspect of the production process that sellers can communicate—their production enjoyment. Buyers are willing to pay a higher price, are more likely to click on ads, and are more likely to choose a product or service when the seller signals that they enjoy producing it. In contrast, sellers are willing to accept lower prices, and actually charge less, for products and services they enjoy producing. Both buyers and sellers make the inference that production enjoyment leads to higher quality products/services, but only buyers rely on this inference when forming their pricing judgments relative to sellers. Nine studies illustrate these effects across a wide variety of products and services, participant samples, and operationalizations of production enjoyment. They show that signals of production enjoyment can influence buyers more than other established signals (e.g., effort) and demonstrate contexts where these effects are more and less likely to occur. These findings offer practical recommendations for both buyers and sellers as well as a variety of theoretical contributions.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 12,0.0287735039912411,False,consumer behavior

Over the past two decades many business families, especially those who own medium-to-large enterprises, have invested much time and resources preparing an orderly transition of their wealth and their enterprises. Many have adopted family constitutions and formal shareholders’ agreements to regulate the relationships among their heirs for generations to come. The Dickensian image of the family meeting at the lawyer’s office, to hear for the first time a relative’s last will and testament, is increasingly a thing of the past. Today, much emphasis is given to the creation of structures and organisational forms (such as trusts, holding companies, shareholder contracts and family protocols) with the hope that these mechanisms will minimise estate taxation and at the same time preserve family harmony in the future. While it is early to tell on the aggregate whether these instruments have in fact accomplished their intended purpose, our experience over 20 years working with business families is that these tools are certainly no panaceas: despite much effort to avoid inheritance and succession conflicts through formal legal arrangements, many business families still run into serious trouble during generational transitions. While we strongly support the notion that formal agreements and legal structures regulating owners are helpful and, indeed, often necessary for the successful continuity of a family enterprise, experience shows that these tools are certainly not sufficient. For there is no legal agreement or structure that, at the end of the day, does not depend on the good will and commitment of the people whose life it sets out to regulate. At first brush this may seem like a self-evident, if not obvious, idea. However, in the seemingly ‘messy’ process of generational transition many business owners and their advisors are often seduced by the tangible nature of the legalities.

We conducted an inductive field study analyzing interactions between client managers and contractors in software development “gigs” mediated by a platform labor market. The platform provided multiple tools client managers could use for control, including in response to unexpected events. We found that, when managers used the tools to exert coercive control over contractors acting unexpectedly, it backfired and contributed to uncompleted project outcomes. In contrast, when they refrained from using the tools for coercive control in such circumstances and instead engaged in what we call collaborative repair, their actions contributed to completed project outcomes. Collaborative repair refers to interactions that surface misaligned interpretations of a situation and help parties negotiate new, reciprocal expectations that restore trust and willingness to continue an exchange. Client managers’ attempts at collaborative repair yielded fuller understanding of project-related breakdowns and shared investment in new expectations, facilitating effective control and completed projects. This study extends prior theories of control by characterizing the new client manager role created by platforms and demonstrating how initiating repair is integral for managers’ capacity to accomplish control in these comparatively brittle work relationships.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.01131812936227843,False,

Some states’ directives spotlight the goal of health promotion (that is, staying healthy) whereas others underscore the goal of illness prevention (keeping safe). Regulatory fit theory holds that persuasiveness is influenced by how well the framing of a message resonates with people’s fundamental motivations that influence recipients’ behavior. People who are motivated to approach desirable outcomes generally respond best to health messages having a promotion frame, whereas people who are motivated to avoid undesirable outcomes respond best to messages having a prevention frame. In the research presented in this article, we show that the effectiveness of COVID-19-related directives is influenced by the fit between promotion or prevention framing and the recipients’ “identity”— whether they view themselves as independent actors or as part of a larger community. In two experiments, we found that an appeal that highlighted health promotion and benefits to the individual (as in “What you can do to help you stay healthy”) or one that highlighted disease prevention and protection to society (as in “…do to keep America safe”) led to the greater intent to practice social distancing than did appeals employing other pairings of framing and identity. Messaging that incorporated regulatory fit were particularly effective in persuading those who were currently lax in social distancing to reduce the number of times they planned to leave home. The findings suggest that policymakers should consider regulatory fit when designing public health communications relating to COVID-19 and other directives.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 3,0.1025755492070117,True,disease prevention

In practice, simple delay announcements, such as average waiting times or a weighted average of previously delayed customers, are often used. Our goal in this paper is to gain insight into when such announcements perform well. To do so, we compare the accuracies of two announcements: (i) a static announcement which does not exploit information about the current state of the system, and (ii) a dynamic announcement, specifically the last-to-enter-service (LES) announcement, which is equal to the delay of the last customer to have entered service at the time of the announcement. So far, the literature on delay announcements has focused, for the most part, on studying the accuracy of various types of announcements in specific queueing models. As such, the practical validity of various announcements remains intimately tied to the appropriateness of the technical conditions under which these models were studied. In other words, in order to decide whether a type of announcement is appropriate for her system, a manager would need to assess whether a certain queueing model is a good fit for her data. Because this is often difficult to do, we propose a new, practice-driven, approach in this paper. In particular, we propose a novel correlation-based approach which is theoretically appealing because it allows for a comparison of the performances of announcements across different queueing models, including multi-class models with a priority service discipline. It is also practically useful because estimating correlations is much easier than fitting an entire queueing model. Using a combination of queuing-theoretic analysis, real-life data analysis, and simulation, we analyze the performance of static and dynamic announcements, and derive an appropriate weighted average of the two which we demonstrate has a superior performance in both theory and practice.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.005110374745551374,False,

In addition, after controlling for observable loan characteristics, loans subject to risk retention requirements appear to be less likely to become troubled. These findings suggest that the risk retention rules have made securitized loans safer in both observable and unobservable dimensions, yet are more expensive to borrowers. Further evidence suggests that the risk-retention rules are binding, with the amount of risk being retained following implementation roughly three times that of before, while lenders also seemed to accelerate the securitization of originated loans during the months immediately before the rules took effect.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.01159607642967011,False,

Conditional on education rates, areas with more uninsured individuals who would qualify for expanded coverage tend to vote in favor, while those with more high-income individuals vote against. Also conditional on education rates, greater hospitals employment is associated with support for expansion, but the presence of other health professionals, whose incomes might decrease from expansion, is associated with less support.

Each approach is second best, resulting in equilibrium qualities and quantities that are less than first-best levels, and the comparison between regulated and negotiated access is ambiguous. However, under a wide range of circumstances VSD and VSN result in greater investment to upgrade network quality than VSR.

Results We identified 40 contextual factors, 78% being barriers. Twenty-one strategies were implemented to address barriers to device qualification, distribution, and management efforts, including engaging stakeholders and conducting ongoing trainings. Notable implementation outcomes included reach with 29 devices in 12 product categories qualified, and all 66 facilities received NEST-qualified devices, effectiveness, in 2024, an average of 87% of all newborn care devices were functional, including those provided by NEST360 and those sourced through existing channels, adoption with over 2476 devices installed at NEST360 sites in 2023. Acceptability was also high with country-level biomedical technicians reporting positive facility-level experiences using the devices. Conclusions The NEST360 approach to ensuring appropriate and functioning equipment for SSNC was successful through multiple strategies to address multilevel barriers. The use of IR facilitated understanding of how strategies addressed context and where change is needed.

In this paper, I highlight one mechanism of gender inequalities in academic hiring: relationship status discrimination. Through a qualitative case study of junior faculty search committees at a large R1 university, I show that committees actively considered women’s—but not men’s—relationship status when selecting hires. Drawing from gendered scripts of career and family that present men’s careers as taking precedence over women’s, committee members assumed that heterosexual women whose partners held academic or high-status jobs were not “movable,” and excluded such women from offers when there were viable male or single female alternatives. Conversely, committees infrequently discussed male applicants’ relationship status and saw all female partners as movable. Consequently, I show that the “two-body problem” is a gendered phenomenon embedded in cultural stereotypes and organizational practices that can disadvantage women in academic hiring. I conclude by discussing the implications of such relationship status discrimination for sociological research on labor market inequalities and faculty diversity.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 5,0.09404303534949296,True,discrimination; gender bias; gender discrimination; gender disparities; gender equity; gender inequality; gender-focused policies; gender-sensitive policies; women in the workforce; workplace equality

The approach fits product life cycle (PLC) curves to historical customer order data, clusters the curves of similar products, and uses the representative curve of the new product's cluster to generate its forecast. We propose three families of curves to fit the PLC: Bass diffusion curves, polynomial curves and simple piecewise-linear curves (triangles and trapezoids). Using a large data set of customer orders for 4,037,826 units of 170 Dell computer products sold over three years, we compare goodness-of-fit and complexity for these families of curves. Fourth-order polynomial curves provide the best fit with piecewise-linear curves a close second. Using a trapezoidal fit, we find that the PLCs in our data have very short maturity stages; more than 20% have no maturity stage and are best fit by a triangle. The fitted PLC curves of similar products are clustered either by known product characteristics or by data-driven clustering. Our key empirical finding is that data-driven clustering of simple triangles and trapezoids, which are simple-to-estimate and explain, performs best for forecasting. Our conservative out-of-sample forecast evaluation, using data-driven clustering of triangles and trapezoids, results in mean absolute errors approximately 3-4% below Dell's forecasts.

Lee; Raziel Riemer,2024,"Emotion recognition is key to interpersonal communication and to human–machine interaction. Body expression may contribute to emotion recognition, but most past studies focused on a few motions, limiting accurate recognition. Moreover, emotions in most previous research were acted out, resulting in non–natural motion, which is unapplicable in reality. We present an approach for emotion recognition based on body motion in naturalistic settings, examining authentic emotions, natural movement, and a broad collection of motion parameters. A lab experiment using 24 participants manipulated participants’ emotions using pretested movies into five conditions: happiness, relaxation, fear, sadness, and emotionally–neutral. Emotion was manipulated within subjects, with fillers in between and a counterbalanced order. A motion capture system measured posture and motion during standing and walking; a force plate measured center of pressure location. Traditional statistics revealed nonsignificant effects of emotions on most motion parameters; only 7 of 229 parameters demonstrate significant effects. Most significant effects are in parameters representing postural control during standing, which is consistent with past studies. Yet, the few significant effects suggest that it is impossible to recognize emotions based on a single motion parameter. We therefore developed machine learning models to classify emotions using a collection of parameters, and examined six models: k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, logistic regression, and the support vector machine with radial base function and linear and polynomial functions. The decision tree using 25 parameters provided the highest average accuracy (45.8%), more than twice the random guess for five conditions, which advances past studies demonstrating comparable accuracies, due to our naturalistic setting. This research suggests that machine learning models are valuable for emotion recognition in reality and lays the foundation for further progress in emotion recognition models, informing the development of recognition devices (e.g., depth camera), to be used in home-setting human–machine interactions.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.009749879505334876,False,

We then consider a framework that includes the supply-side response to different funding regimes; that is, how do enrollment and tuition decisions of schools respond to changes in education financing? We show that shifting from parent-based funding to a student loan program can lower aggregate savings, although welfare still improves if education has a higher return than physical capital investment. A public student loan program also tends to promote enrollment at the cost of higher tuition at for-profit schools and deteriorating loan performance, paid for by taxpayers.

The existing literature has provided a wide range of answers, finding that news shocks can account for 10 percent to 60 percent of the volatility of output. We show that looking at the dynamics of inventories, so far neglected in this literature, cleanly isolates the role of news shocks in driving business cycles. In particular, inventory dynamics provide an upper bound on the explanatory power of news shocks. We show, for a broad class of theoretical models, that finished-good inventories must fall when there is an increase in consumption and investment induced by news shocks. When good news about future fundamentals lowers expected future marginal costs, firms delay current production and satisfy the increase in demand by selling from existing inventories. This result is robust across the nature of the news and the presence of different types of adjustment costs. We therefore propose a novel empirical identification strategy for news shocks: negative comovement between inventories and components of private spending. Estimating a structural VAR with sign restrictions on inventories, consumption and investment, our identified shock explains at most 20 percent of output variations. Intuitively, since inventories are procyclical in the data, shocks that generate negative comovement between inventories and sales cannot account for the bulk of business-cycle fluctuations.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 1,0.03762989670974848,False,economic shocks

If well-orchestrated, these two types of learning reinforce each other. New experience is followed by reflection, which generates ideas that can be tested through subsequent experience.

Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate imprecise rank claims.

Our results show that, following a paycut, CEOs are likely to engage in earnings management in an attempt to accelerate improvement in the reported performance and to achieve a speedier restoration of their pay to pre-cut levels. Further, we find that improvement in long-term performance after a paycut occurs only for those firms with lower levels of earnings management after the paycut.

We tested these competing hypotheses using functional neuroimaging. Participants judged ten groups (e.g. Europeans, Muslims, rats) on four scales: blatant dehumanization, dislike, dissimilarity and perceived within-group homogeneity. Consistent with expectations, neural responses when making ratings of dehumanization diverged from those when judging the same targets on the other related dimensions. Specifically, we found regions in the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) that were selectively parametrically modulated by dehumanization ratings. The pattern of responses in the left IFC was also consistent with animalistic dehumanization: high responses to low-status human groups and animals, and lower responses to high- status human groups.

This paper studies how task prioritization impacts the capacity of such hierarchical networks using a conceptual queuing framework that formalizes coordination and switching idleness. To maximize the capacity of a team, highest priority should be given to the tasks that require the most collaboration. Otherwise, a mismatch between priority levels and collaboration levels inevitably inflicts a capacity loss. We demonstrate this essential trade-off between task prioritization (quality of service) and capacity (productivity) in a basic collaborative network and in parallel networks.

Method Data were collected by surveying students (n?=?2940) from a stratified sample of U.S. medical schools in fall 2010 (first semester of medical school), spring 2014 (final semester of medical school), and spring 2016 (second year of medical residency).

Additionally, exposure to negative role modeling, also reported during the final semester of medical school, predicted higher levels of explicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Amount of contact with LGBT individuals – and in particular, with LGBT medical students – predicted lower levels of implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency.

To accomplish this, we introduce and validate a blatant measure of dehumanization based on the popular depiction of evolutionary progress in the 'Ascent of Man.' We compare blatant dehumanization to established conceptualizations of subtle and implicit dehumanization, including infrahumanization, perceptions of human nature (HN) and human uniqueness (UH), and implicit associations between ingroup/outgroup and human/animal concepts.

Finally, we show that blatant, but not subtle, dehumanization spikes immediately after incidents of real intergroup violence, and strongly predicts support for aggressive actions like torture and retaliatory violence (after the Boston Marathon bombings, and Woolwich attacks in England).

To materialize this reduction, however, one must accept prioritization policies that are non-monotone (customers arriving at periods of high congestion wait less) and discontinuous (consecutive customers - from the same class - can have starkly different service experiences). Perfect SLD, on the other hand, is equivalent to restricting the family of prioritization rules to the appealing family of monotone-index rules.

Collaboration introduces resource synchronization requirements that are not captured in the standard procedure (formalized through a static planning problem) to identify bottlenecks and theoretical capacity. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable idleness. In general, collaboration architectures may feature unavoidable idleness so that the theoretical capacity exceeds the maximal achievable throughput or actual capacity. This fundamental tradeoff between collaboration and throughput does not disappear in multi-server networks and has important ramifications to service-system staffing. We identify a special class of collaboration architectures that have no unavoidable idleness and present a condition on this architecture that guarantees, regardless of the processing times of the various activities, that the standard bottleneck procedure in fact identifies the actual capacity of the network. In multi-server cases this class of networks guarantees that the theoretical capacity is achievable provided one has the right number of floaters. Finally, we study the subtleties that collaboration introduces to questions of flexibility investment. Unavoidable idleness may limit the ability to materialize the benefits of flexibility. We study the interplay of flexibility and unavoidable idleness and offer remedies derived from collaboration architecture.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 17,0.02840570444589764,False,

Analysis is needed to guide the placement of devices within health systems to optimize the tuberculosis (TB) case detection rate (CDR). Methods We used epidemiological and operational data from Uganda (139 sites serving 87,600 individuals tested for TB) to perform a model-based comparison of the following placement strategies for Xpert devices: 1) Health center level (sites ranked by size from national referral hospitals to health care level III centers), 2) Smear volume (sites ranked from highest to lowest volume of smear microscopy testing), 3) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) volume (sites ranked from greatest to least patients on ART), 4) External equality assessment (EQA) performance (sites ranked from worst to best smear microscopy performance) and 5) TB prevalence (sites ranked from highest to lowest). We compared two clinical algorithms, one where Xpert was used only for smear microscopy negative samples versus another replacing smear microscopy. The primary outcome was TB CDR; secondary outcomes were detection of multi-drug resistant TB, number of sites requiring device placement to achieve specified rollout coverage, and cost. Results Placement strategies that prioritized sites with higher TB prevalence maximized CDR, with an incremental rate of 6.2–12.6% compared to status quo (microscopy alone). Diagnosis of MDR-TB was greatest in the TB Prevalence strategy when Xpert was used in place of smear microscopy. While initial implementation costs were lowest in the Smear Volume strategy, cost per additional TB case detected was lowest in the TB prevalence strategy. Conclusion In Uganda, placement of Xpert devices in sites with high TB prevalence yielded the highest TB CDR at the lowest cost per additional case diagnosed. These results represent novel use of program level data to inform the optimal placement of new technology in resource-constrained settings.",Official Website,100.0,Goal 3,0.03742916071005968,False,

They then focus specifically on the use of AR to facilitate product evaluation prior to purchase and empirically investigate its impact on sales in online retail. Using data obtained from an international cosmetics retailer, they find that AR usage on the retailer’s mobile app is associated with higher sales for brands that are less popular, products with narrower appeal, and products that are more expensive. In addition, the effect of AR is stronger for customers who are new to the online channel or product category, suggesting that the sales increase is coming from online channel adoption and category expansion. These findings provide converging evidence that AR is most effective when product-related uncertainty is high, demonstrating the technology’s potential to increase sales by reducing uncertainty and instilling purchase confidence.

This outcome often is attributed to the effects of negative sex-based stereotypes. We studied the effect of such stereotypes in an experimental market, where subjects were hired to perform an arithmetic task that, on average, both genders perform equally well. We find that without any information other than a candidate's appearance (which makes sex clear), both male and female subjects are twice more likely to hire a man than a woman. The discrimination survives if performance on the arithmetic task is self-reported, because men tend to boast about their performance, whereas women generally underreport it. The discrimination is reduced, but not eliminated, by providing full information about previous performance on the task. By using the Implicit Association Test, we show that implicit stereotypes are responsible for the initial average bias in sex-related beliefs and for a bias in updating expectations when performance information is self-reported. That is, employers biased against women are less likely to take into account the fact that men, on average, boast more than women about their future performance, leading to suboptimal hiring choices that remain biased in favor of men",Official Website,100.0,Goal 5,0.07251324798464655,True,gender bias; gender discrimination; women in the workforce

Whereas previous research suggests that anti-egalitarians (vs. egalitarians) dispositionally exhibit less empathy for others, we propose this relationship depends on the target's position in the social hierarchy. We examined this question across eight studies (N = 3,154) conducted in the U.S. and the U.K., including online and in-person experiments and examining attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. We observed that (anti-)egalitarianism negatively predicted empathy for members of disadvantaged groups subjected to harmful situations, but positively predicted empathy for members of advantaged groups. This pattern held regardless of perceivers' own membership in advantaged or disadvantaged groups (i.e., perceiver gender, race, or SES). (Anti-)egalitarianism's differential effects on empathy for advantaged versus disadvantaged targets were due in part to differences in perceived degree of harm incurred (beyond roles for perceived value conflict and perceived deservingness): Egalitarians perceived the same action as more harmful than anti-egalitarians when it occurred to a disadvantaged target but less harmful than anti-egalitarians when it occurred to an advantaged target. We also explored how these patterns informed individuals' downstream policy attitudes and policy-relevant behavior (e.g., willingness to sign a petition).

Across five pre-registered experiments (N = 2,498), we find robust evidence that the inclusion of moral-emotional expressions in political messages causes intentions to share the messages on social media. Moreover, individual differences in the strength of partisan identification and ideological extremity are robust predictors of sharing messages with moral-emotional expressions, even when accounting for attitude strength. But we only found mixed evidence that brief manipulations of identity salience increased sharing. In terms of functional outcomes, when partisans choose to share messages with moral-emotional language, people perceive them as more strongly identified among their partisan ingroup, but less open-minded and less worthy of conversation with outgroup members.

The reason is the existence of two distinct mechanisms of property protection. One is formal constraints that allow individuals or groups to block any redistribution that is not in their favor. The other occurs in equilibrium where players without such powers protect each other from redistribution. Players without formal veto power anticipate that the expropriation of other similar players will ultimately hurt them and thus combine their influence to prevent redistributions.

Flights are preassigned to landing slots feasible for their arrival times. After airlines report (privately learned) updates about flight times and cancelations, the FAA's objective is to create a new queue that minimizes some measure of delay. We separately consider airlines' incentives to misreport their flights' (i) feasible arrival times, (ii) delay costs, or (iii) cancelations. Our first three results show that any fully efficient rescheduling rule must be manipulable by each of these three methods separately. By weakening efficiency to a form currently achieved by the FAA, we show that one can recover incentive compatibility with respect to (ii) and (iii).

While a large body of previous work has estimated the effects of that contracting, surprisingly little has investigated how those effects vary with the generosity of the contract. In this paper we examine this issue in the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, through which the federal government contracts with private insurers to coordinate and finance health care for 17 million Medicare recipients. To do this, we exploit a substantial policy-induced increase in MA reimbursement in metropolitan areas with a population of 250,000 or more relative to MSAs below this threshold. Our results demonstrate that the additional reimbursement leads more private firms to enter this market and to an increase in the share of Medicare recipients enrolled in MA plans. Our findings also reveal that about one-eighth of the additional reimbursement is passed through to consumers in the form of better coverage. A somewhat larger share accrues to private insurers in the form of higher profits and we find suggestive evidence of a large impact on advertising expenditures. Our results have implications for a key feature of the Affordable Care Act that will reduce reimbursement to MA plans by $156 billion from 2013 to 2022.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 3,0.03372984139041624,False,

Finkel,2023,"There are two unresolved puzzles in the literature examining how people evaluate mates (i.e., prospective or current romantic/sexual partners). First, compatibility is theoretically crucial, but attempts to explain why certain perceivers are compatible with certain targets have revealed small effects. Second, features of partners (e.g., personality, consensually rated attributes) affect perceivers' evaluations strongly in initial-attraction contexts but weakly in established relationships. Mate Evaluation Theory (MET) addresses these puzzles, beginning with the Social Relations Model postulate that all evaluative constructs (e.g., attraction, relationship satisfaction) consist of target, perceiver, and relationship variance. MET then explains how people draw evaluations from mates' attributes using four information sources: (a) shared evolved mechanisms and cultural scripts (common lens, which produces target variance); (b) individual differences that affect how a perceiver views all targets (perceiver lens, which produces perceiver variance); (c) individual differences that affect how a perceiver views some targets, depending on the targets' features (feature lens, which produces some relationship variance); and (d) narratives about and idiosyncratic reactions to one particular target (target-specific lens, which produces most relationship variance). These two distinct sources of relationship variance (i.e., feature vs. target-specific) address Puzzle #1: Previous attempts to explain compatibility used feature lens information, but relationship variance likely derives primarily from the (understudied) target-specific lens. MET also addresses Puzzle #2 by suggesting that repeated interaction causes the target-specific lens to expand, which reduces perceivers' use of the common lens.

On implementing the procedures with a panel of S&P 500 options, our estimates clearly suggest the existence of highly statistically significant temporal variation in both of the tails.

new management philosophy have reduced the need for direct supervision but generated a much greater demand for internal collaboration, leading in turn to the emergence of a managerial class whose primary role is collaboration rather than supervision. To test this, I analyzed a large volume of data, including millions of managerial job postings, a large collection of managers’ resumes, job reviews written by employees, and several unique firm-level datasets. These analyses generated three sets of findings. First, in recent decades, the expectations of the managerial role have quickly changed, in almost all sectors, from supervision to collaboration. Second, this new managerial role is especially concentrated in innovation-focused firms. Finally, firms treating managers as collaborators have a much higher proportion of middle managers than those still treating them primarily as supervisors. Thus, accounting for changing managerial roles could explain a significant portion of the managerial growth in recent decades.

Ku; Cynthia Wang; Adam Galinsky,2015,"Successful managers and leaders need to effectively navigate their organizational worlds, from motivating customers and employees to managing diversity to preventing and resolving conflicts. Perspective-taking is a psychological process that is particularly relevant to each of these activities. The current review critically examines perspective-taking research conducted by both management scholars and social psychologists and specifies perspective-taking's antecedents, consequences, mechanisms, and moderators, as well as identifies theoretical and/or empirical shortfalls. Our summary of the current state of perspective-taking research offers three important contributions. First, we offer a new definition of perspective-taking: the active cognitive process of imagining the world from another's vantage point or imagining oneself in another's shoes to understand their visual viewpoint, thoughts, motivations, intentions, and/or emotions. Second, we highlight that although perspective-taking has many positive benefits for managers and leaders, it also carries with it the potential for perverse effects.

While their actions are sometimes deemed morally courageous, existing evidence that whistleblowers are primarily motivated by moral concerns is mixed. Moreover, little is known about the extent to which moral concerns predict whistleblowing relative to other organizational and situational factors. To address these gaps, we present two studies demonstrating the power of moral concerns in predicting whistleblowing decisions. Study 1 uses a large cross-sectional dataset of federal employees (N = 42,020) to test how moral concerns predict real-world whistleblowing decisions relative to other factors. Study 2 provides a more controlled replication of the association between moral concerns and whistleblowing decisions in an online sample of the U.S. workforce. Results revealed that moral concerns consistently predicted whistleblowing decisions above and beyond other organizational and situational factors. Specifically, whistleblowing decisions were associated with a tradeoff between moral concerns; whereby, concerns for the fair treatment of others beyond one's organization were associated with reporting unethical behavior, while loyalty to one's organization was associated with not reporting unethical behavior. Organizational factors, such as whether the organization educates its employees about how to disclose wrongdoing, showed a somewhat weaker association with whistleblowing decisions across studies. However, they were the only significant predictors of how people blew the whistle; that is, reporting unethical behavior through internal versus external channels. Together, these findings reveal important psychological motivations underlying whistleblowing, highlighting the power of moral concerns in these decisions and supporting conceptualizations of whistleblowing as an important example of moral courage.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 10,0.004350583341197013,False,

We propose the answer is found in a single word: Hierarchy. In the current article, we review the employee voice literature and the role that the power and status of both the voicer and the voice target play in the decision to speak up, as well as the communication, appraisals, attributions, and reactions to that voice. Identifying the vital role hierarchy plays in the voice process, including the desire to ascend a hierarchy, led us to offer a new, broader definition of voice that acknowledges both prosocial and self-interested motivations. We define employee voice as any voluntary, internal, and upward communication intended to achieve one or several goals related to a person’s work, position, or needs within their organization; the work, position, or needs of other organizational stakeholders; and/or the functioning of their organization. To synthesize past findings and offer a generative theoretical lens, we introduce the Hierarchy of Voice framework. This framework extends prior perspectives by offering a dyadic approach that incorporates the perspective of the voice target. In doing so, our framework also captures the dynamic relationship between voice and hierarchy, where voice can reinforce or alter the standing of the voicer and the target.

Seven percent of advisers have misconduct records, and this share reaches more than 15% at some of the largest advisory firms. Roughly one third of advisers with misconduct are repeat offenders. Prior offenders are five times as likely to engage in new misconduct as the average financial adviser. Firms discipline misconduct: approximately half of financial advisers lose their jobs after misconduct. The labor market partially undoes firm-level discipline by rehiring such advisers. Firms that hire these advisers also have higher rates of prior misconduct themselves, suggesting ""matching on misconduct."" These firms are less desirable and offer lower compensation. We argue that heterogeneity in consumer sophistication could explain the prevalence and persistence of misconduct at such firms.

The estimation is based on aggregating the observed option data into nonparametric estimates of the conditional characteristic function of the return distribution, the derivatives of which allow to infer the Fourier transform of a known transform of the Lévy density in a way which is robust to the level of the unknown diffusive volatility of the asset price. The Lévy density estimate is then constructed via Fourier inversion. We derive an asymptotic bound for the integrated squared error of the estimator in the general case as well as its probability limit in the special Lévy case. We further show rate optimality of our Lévy density estimator in a minimax sense.

In eight samples across three nations and religious traditions, we find that greater religiosity is associated with greater slippery slope thinking.

This shift in team size raises the question of whether and how the character of the science and technology produced by large teams differs from that of small teams. Here we analyse more than 65 million papers, patents and software products that span the period 1954–2014, and demonstrate that across this period smaller teams have tended to disrupt science and technology with new ideas and opportunities, whereas larger teams have tended to develop existing ones.

By contrast, contributions by smaller teams search more deeply into the past, are viewed as disruptive to science and technology and succeed further into the future—if at all. Observed differences between small and large teams are magnified for higher-impact work, with small teams known for disruptive work and large teams for developing work. Differences in topic and research design account for a small part of the relationship between team size and disruption; most of the effect occurs at the level of the individual, as people move between smaller and larger teams.

Our characterization results show that these two frictions lead to a reduction in aggregate output, as firms may find it optimal to rely more heavily on less volatile suppliers, even if it comes at the cost of forgoing more efficient ones. We also find that the interaction between informational frictions and quantity rigidities dampens the impact of productivity and aggregate demand shocks on aggregate output, while increasing the inflationary effects of positive shocks to nominal aggregate demand. The magnitudes of these effects depend on the distribution of the two frictions over the production network.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 1,0.03019931759201509,False,economic shocks

This chapter examines one source of ambiguity that organizations face, which is based on their efforts to implement moral mandates. These mandates, which are related to areas such as environmental sustainability and diversity, are inherently ambiguous, as they lack a shared understanding regarding their scope and associated practices. They are also often broad and systemic and may be unclearly aligned with an organization's strategy. Due to these challenges, in this chapter, we theorize that collective action at the field level is necessary for organizations to advance and concretize moral mandates. We examine this theorizing through the case of the implementation of sustainability in higher education. We hypothesize and find support for the idea that when an organization's members engage in collective action at the field level, those organizations have an increased likelihood of achieving sustainability implementation. To gain insight into this field-to-organization relationship, we qualitatively examine 18 years of conversations from an online forum to develop a process model of moral mandate implementation. We theorize that collective action functions as a field-configuring space, in which actors from a variety of organizations come together to (1) refine the scope of the mandate and (2) create an implementation repertoire that actors can draw on when seeking to bring sustainability to their own organizations. Overall, our study provides a model of how ambiguous moral mandates can be implemented by highlighting the important role of collective action across organizations in concretizing those mandates and providing actors with the tools for their implementation.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 12,0.03088503344046049,False,corporate sustainability; sustainability awareness; sustainability innovation; sustainable development; sustainable management

Drawing from focus groups of Black certified public accountants and in-depth interviews with both Black accountants and White supervisors of Black accountants, we developed a theoretical framework highlighting crucial psychological, behavioral, and relational factors that we predict are associated with reduced turnover intentions by Black employees. We propose that Black employees' racial centrality is associated with racial identity affirmation—attempts to affirm one's racial identity by expressing and highlighting positive aspects of one's racial group. Furthermore, we posit that the relationship between racial identity affirmation and reduced turnover intentions is weaker for Black accountants who feel less close to their supervisors, as their affirmations are less likely to be validated.

Health systems have attempted to increase screening awareness through advertising. Psychological theories suggest that construal level (a personal orientation toward the big picture or the details) and regulatory focus (goals emphasizing acquisition of a good or avoidance of a bad outcome) play a key role in health advertising effectiveness. These theories have not been examined in a screen-eligible population. Methods Using Amazon’s crowdsourcing platform, Mechanical Turk, we identified screen-eligible individuals based on US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. We randomly assigned participants to see 1 of 4 screening advertisement images in a 2 (construal level: high vs low) × 2 (regulatory focus: promotion vs prevention) between-subjects experimental design. We assessed willingness to undergo screening after the advertisement. Results One hundred ninety-one individuals responded to our study invitation (mean age, 61 years). We found that the high construal/promotion focus image led to a greater willingness to screen compared with images representing other psychological states (P = .04). Regarding the personality traits of our respondents, high construal/promotion focus was the most prevalent (40%) trait combination, whereas low construal/prevention focus was the least prevalent (17%). Conclusions The psychological focus of health-related messages affects an individual’s willingness to undergo lung cancer screening. Individuals eligible for lung cancer screening are more persuaded by “big picture” messages describing the benefits of screening.

Help can come through relatively paternalistic or agentic aid. Paternalistic aid, such as banning certain foods to encourage weight loss or donating food to alleviate poverty, restricts recipients’ choices compared with agentic aid, such as providing calorie counts or donating cash. Nine experiments demonstrate that how people choose to help depends partly on their beliefs about the recipient’s mental capacities. People perceive paternalistic aid to be more effective for those who seem less mentally capable (Experiments 1 and 2), and people therefore give more paternalistically when others are described as relatively incompetent (Experiment 3). Because people tend to believe that they are more mentally capable than are others, people also believe that paternalistic aid will be more effective for others than for oneself, effectively treating other adults more like children (Experiments 4a–5b). Experiencing a personal mental shortcoming—overeating on Thanksgiving—therefore increased the perceived effectiveness of paternalism for oneself, such that participants thought paternalistic antiobesity policies would be more effective when surveyed the day after Thanksgiving than the day before (Experiment 6). A final experiment demonstrates that the link between perceived effectiveness of aid and mental capacity is bidirectional: Those receiving paternalistic aid were perceived as less mentally capable than those receiving relatively agentic aid (Experiment 7). Beliefs about how best to help someone in need are affected by subtle inferences about the mind of the person in need.

The effect of considering other aggregate methods in addition to average and maximum, for computing the collaboration features based on the feature of the members is examined as well. A dataset extracted from Northwestern University’s SciVal Expert is used for evaluating the proposed approach. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed collaboration features in order to increase the prediction performance in combination with the widely-used features like h-index and average citation counts.

Firms are not necessarily symmetric in their R&D abilities; some may have an advantage in early stages of the R&D process while others may have advantages in other stages of the process. This paper uses a two-firm asymmetric-ability multistage R&D race model to analyze the effect of patents, imitations and licensing arrangements on the speed of innovation, firm value and consumers' surplus. By using numerical analyses to study the MPE of the R&D race, the paper demonstrates the circumstances under which a weak patent protection regime, that facilitates free imitation of any intermediate technology, may yield a higher consumers' surplus and total surplus than a regime that awards a patent for the final innovation.

The impediments to reallocation increase with the dispersion in productivity and decrease with the interest rate, the frequency of sectoral shocks, and households’ consumption smoothing motives. When households are risk averse, delaying reallocation serves as a hedge against future shocks, which can lead to persistent misallocation.

The asymptotic setting is based on observations within a fixed time interval with mesh of the observation grid shrinking to zero. The test is derived for semimartingales whose “spot” jump compensator around zero is like that of a stable process, but importantly the stability index can vary over the time interval. The test is based on forming a sequence of local estimators of the jump activity over blocks of shrinking time span and contrasting their variability around a global activity estimator based on the whole data set. The local and global jump activity estimates are constructed from the real part of the empirical characteristic function of the increments of the process scaled by local power variations. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of constant jump activity and show that the test has asymptotic power of one against fixed alternatives of processes with time-varying jump activity.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 17,0.0199909736795599,False,

Unlike classical linear regressions, jump regressions are determined by a small number of jumps occurring over a fixed time interval and the rest of the components of the processes around the jump times. The latter are the continuous martingale parts of the processes as well as observation noise. By sampling more frequently the role of these components, which are hidden in the observed price, shrinks asymptotically. The robustness of our inference procedure is with respect to outliers, which are of particular importance in the current setting of relatively small number of jump observations. This is achieved by using nonsmooth loss functions (like L1) in the estimation. Unlike classical robust methods, the limit of the objective function here remains nonsmooth. The proposed method is also robust to measurement error in the observed processes, which is achieved by locally smoothing the high-frequency increments. In an empirical application to financial data, we illustrate the usefulness of the robust techniques by contrasting the behavior of robust and ordinary least regression (OLS)-type jump regressions in periods including disruptions of the financial markets such as so-called “flash crashes.” Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 9,0.01228388043459136,False,

This movement, which has analogs throughout the empirical sciences, is broad and diverse, but its primary emphasis has been on the reduction of statistical false positives. The present article addresses epistemological and pragmatic issues that we, as a field, must consider as we seek to maximize the scientific value of this movement. Regarding epistemology, this article contrasts the false-positives-reduction (FPR) approach with an alternative, the error balance (EB) approach, which argues that any serious consideration of optimal scientific practice must contend simultaneously with both false-positive and false-negative errors. Regarding pragmatics, the movement has devoted a great deal of attention to issues that frequently arise in laboratory experiments and one-shot survey studies, but it has devoted less attention to issues that frequently arise in intensive and/or longitudinal studies. We illustrate these epistemological and pragmatic considerations with the case of relationship science, one of the many research domains that frequently employ intensive and/or longitudinal methods. Specifically, we examine 6 research prescriptions that can help to reduce false-positive rates: preregistration, prepublication sharing of materials, postpublication sharing of data, close replication, avoiding piecemeal publication, and increasing sample size. For each, we offer concrete guidance not only regarding how researchers can improve their research practices and balance the risk of false-positive and false-negative errors, but also how the movement can capitalize upon insights from research practices within relationship science to make the movement stronger and more inclusive.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 9,0.01347403485996765,False,

The separation of volatility from jumps is done in a novel way by making use of the second derivative of the Laplace transform of the returns, de-biased using either the value of the Laplace transform or of its second derivative evaluated at high frequencies.

We also explored the psychological mechanisms of competition pool size to explain why and how being in a larger competition pool increases cheating. Our findings reveal a serial mediation pathway whereby having a larger number of competitors increases expectations of the absolute number of cheaters in the competition group, which heightens perceptions that cheating is an acceptable social norm, which leads to more cheating. We also examined and ruled out various alternative psychological mechanisms for this effect. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our finding that being in a large group of competitors can increase people’s propensity to cheat for personal gain.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 1,0.008086301082307405,False,

However, this strategy can create imbalances in task coverage, often requiring staff to fill the gaps. The aim of this study is to develop scheduling strategies to create a balanced schedule that effectively combines workforce types (paid staff and volunteers) while keeping volunteers engaged. This is achieved by accounting for volunteers’ responses to changes in scheduling options. We develop an optimization model that recognizes volunteers’ scheduling responses and utilizes these responses to design policies aimed at achieving a balanced coverage across time slots. This involves reducing over-covered and under-covered time slots over the planning horizon. By understanding the preferences of volunteers, organizations can modify their current policies to better match supply with demand keeping their volunteers engaged. We provide an implementable scheduling strategy combining staff assignment and volunteers’ autonomy in scheduling choices. Case study results show an improvement compared to current scheduling policies.

A large literature estimates these returns, often carefully addressing issues such as selection into wage employment and endogeneity in terms of completed schooling. There has been much less exploration of whether the estimates of Mincerian returns depend on how information about wage work is collected. Relying on a survey experiment in Tanzania, this paper finds that estimates of the returns to education vary by questionnaire design, but not by whether the information on employment and wages is self-reported or collected by a proxy respondent. The differences derived from questionnaire type are substantial, varying from higher returns of 5 percentage points among the most well educated men to 16 percentage points among the least well educated women. These differences are at magnitudes similar to the bias in ordinary least squares estimation, which receives considerable attention in the literature.

Design This study was an economic analysis of EKs at a single academic institution using time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) methodology. Participants Endothelial keratoplasty surgical cases, including Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) and Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK), at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center from 2016 to 2018 were included in the analysis. Methods Data and inputs were obtained via the electronic health record (EHR) and from prior literature. Simultaneous cataract surgeries were included and separately categorized for analysis. Endothelial keratoplasty expenses were determined with TDABC, a method for cost calculation that incorporates the time that key resources are used and each resource’s associated cost rate. Main Outcome Measures Main outcome measures included surgery length (in minutes) and day-of-surgery costs. Results There were 559 EKs included: 355 DMEKs and 204 DSAEKs. Fewer DSAEKs had simultaneous cataract extraction (47; 23%) than DMEK (169; 48%). Of the DMEKs, 196 (55%) used preloaded corneal grafts. Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty cost $392.31 less (95% confidence interval, $251.05–$533.57; P < 0.0001) than DSAEK and required 16.94 fewer minutes (14.16–19.73; P < 0.0001). Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty cases that used preloaded corneal grafts cost $460.19 less ($316.23–$604.14; P < 0.0001) and were 14.16 minutes shorter (11.39–16.93; P < 0.0001). In multivariate regression, preloaded graft use saved $457.19, DMEK (compared with DSAEK) saved $349.97, and simultaneous cataract surgery added $855.17 in day-of-surgery costs. Conclusions Cost analysis of TDABC identified a day-of-surgery cost and surgical time reduction associated with the use of preloaded grafts for DMEK, DMEK compared with DSAEK, and isolated EK compared with EK combined with cataract surgery. This study provides an improved understanding of surgical cost drivers and margin incentivization, which may explain trends and indirectly influence patient care decisions in cornea surgery practices.

In this paper, we take advantage of a massive, longitudinal mobile phone dataset that consists of human mobility and social network information simultaneously, allowing us to explore the impact of human mobility patterns on the underlying social network. We find that human mobility plays an important role in shaping both local and global structural properties of social network. In contrast to the lack of scale in social networks and human movements, we discovered a characteristic distance in physical space between 10 and 20 km that impacts both local clustering and modular structure in social network.

Whether VPIN is more strongly correlated with volume or volatility depends on the exact implementation. Hence, it is crucial for the interpretation of VPIN as a harbinger of market turbulence or as a predictor of short-term volatility to control for current volume and volatility. Doing so, we find no evidence of incremental predictive power of VPIN for future volatility. Likewise, VPIN does not attain unusual extremes prior to the flash crash. Moreover, the properties of VPIN are strongly dependent on the underlying trade classification. In particular, using more standard classification techniques, VPIN behaves in the exact opposite manner of what is portrayed in ELO, 2011a, ELO, 2012a. At a minimum, ELO should rationalize this systematic reversal as the classification becomes more closely aligned with individual transactions.
ELO (2014) dispute our findings. This note reviews the econometric methodology and the market microstructure arguments behind our conclusions and responds to a number of inaccurate assertions. In addition, we summarize fresh empirical evidence that corroborates the hypothesis that VPIN is largely driven, and significantly distorted, by the volume and volatility innovations. Furthermore, we note there is compelling new evidence that transaction-based classification schemes are more accurate than the bulk volume strategies advocated by ELO for constructing VPIN. In fact, using perfect classification leads to diametrically opposite results relative to ELO, 2011a, ELO, 2012a.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 17,0.01008895308135887,False,

These results allow us to interpret relevant measures as reflecting part of perceived ambiguity, meaning subjective uncertainty about probabilities over states. Under mild conditions, we show that increases or decreases in ambiguity aversion cannot affect the relevant measures. This property, necessary for the conclusion that these measures reflect only perceived ambiguity, distinguishes the set of relevant measures from the leading alternative in the literature.

Our evidence suggests that the influence of loan loss reserves added back as regulatory capital (hereafter referred to as “add-backs”) on bank risk cannot be explained by either economic principles underlying the notion of capital or accounting principles underlying the recording of reserves. Specifically, we observe that, in sharp contrast to the economic notion of capital as a buffer against bank failure risk, add-backs are positively associated with the risk of bank failure during the recent economic crisis. Furthermore, the positive association of add-backs with bank failure risk is concentrated among cases in which the add-backs are highly likely to increase a bank’s total regulatory capital. The evidence cannot thus be fully explained by accounting principles either, since the role of loan loss reserves according to those principles does not depend on whether the reserves generate a regulatory capital increase. Additional analysis suggests that the observed influence of loan loss reserves on bank failure risk may be an unintended consequence of their regulatory treatment as capital.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 15,0.02461913231406171,False,

One key prerequisite of harnessing the ""crowd wisdom"" is the independency of individuals' opinions, yet in real settings collective opinions are rarely simple aggregations of independent minds. Recent experimental studies document that disclosing prior collective opinions distorts individuals' decision making as well as their perceptions of quality and value, highlighting a fundamental disconnect from current modeling efforts: How to model social influence and its impact on systems that are constantly evolving? In this paper, we develop a mechanistic framework to model social influence of prior collective opinions (e.g., online product ratings) on subsequent individual decision making. We find our method successfully captures the dynamics of rating growth, helping us separate social influence bias from inherent values. Using large-scale longitudinal customer rating datasets, we demonstrate that our model not only effectively assesses social influence bias, but also accurately predicts long-term cumulative growth of ratings solely based on early rating trajectories.

Utilizing publicly available micro-level lending data, we investigate two increasingly significant margins of adjustment in credit markets: banks’ ability to sell loans and shadow bank activity. These adjustment margins are substantial and vary across time and regions with different incomes. We examine these margins in a parsimonious dynamic quantitative model featuring banks with balance sheet adjustment through loan sales and shadow banks. Using the calibrated model, we illustrate that these margins significantly dampen the immediate contraction following bank capital shock. Recovery is also faster, because profitable loan sales (e.g., securitization) allow banks to build capital faster and because shadow banks pick up lending slack. Failure to account for adjustment margins leads to significant errors when studying policies which rely on financial intermediation pass-through in the level of aggregate lending, its direction, and composition. Our model highlights the tension between bank balance sheet models and data. The model, which forces total lending to depend strongly on bank balance sheet health, must reconcile the weak correlation between bank capital and aggregate lending. These issues can be reconciled with now available data from bank balance sheets, overall bank lending, and aggregate lending, in conjunction with a model of modern financial intermediation.",Google Scholar,100.0,Goal 17,0.02441042489305643,False,

However, the strength of this behavioral effect exhibits substantial variation (up to three times the average magnitude) across methodological decisions: employing price-quality tradeoffs, nondurable categories, or binary-trinary choice-set comparisons tend to reduce the probability of extremeness aversion among consumers, whereas using a larger number of tradeoff dimensions, non-numeric attributes, high-quality extensions, or utilitarian products increase its likelihood. Because extremeness aversion has been assessed using three different measurement paradigms (absolute-share changes, relative-share shifts, and middle-option proportions), we discuss their characteristics and investigate their degree of agreement.

Whether uncertainty reduces to ordinary risk depends on the agent’s ability to smooth consumption. Uncertainty can have a major behavioral and economic impact, including precautionary behavior that may appear overly conservative to an outside observer. We argue that one of the main characteristics of uncertain beliefs is that they are not empirical, in the sense that they cannot be objectively tested to determine whether they are right or wrong.

First, we examined commenting behavior across over 9,000 unique cultural contexts (subreddits) and confirmed that discourse is indeed more toxic in partisan (e.g. r/progressive, r/conservatives) than in nonpartisan contexts (e.g. r/movies, r/programming). Next, we analyzed hundreds of millions of comments from over 6.3 million users and found robust evidence that: (i) the discourse of people whose behavior is especially toxic in partisan contexts is also especially toxic in nonpartisan contexts (i.e. people are not politics-only toxicity specialists); and (ii) when considering only nonpartisan contexts, the discourse of people who also comment in partisan contexts is more toxic than the discourse of people who do not. These effects were not driven by socialization processes whereby people overgeneralized toxic behavioral norms they had learned in partisan contexts. In contrast to speculation about the need for partisans to engage beyond their echo chambers, toxicity in nonpartisan contexts was higher among people who also comment in both left-wing and right-wing contexts (bilaterally engaged users) than among people who also comment in only left-wing or right-wing contexts (unilaterally engaged users).

In particular, public and private image datasets of dermatological conditions rarely include information on skin color. As a start towards increasing transparency, AI researchers have appropriated the use of the Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) from a measure of patient photosensitivity to a measure for estimating skin tone in algorithmic audits of computer vision applications including facial recognition and dermatology diagnosis. In order to understand the variability of estimated FST annotations on images, we compare several FST annotation methods on a diverse set of 460 images of skin conditions from both textbooks and online dermatology atlases. These methods include expert annotation by board-certified dermatologists, algorithmic annotation via the Individual Typology Angle algorithm, which is then converted to estimated FST (ITA-FST), and two crowd-sourced, dynamic consensus protocols for annotating estimated FSTs. We find the inter-rater reliability between three board-certified dermatologists is comparable to the inter-rater reliability between the board-certified dermatologists and either of the crowdsourcing methods. In contrast, we find that the ITA-FST method produces annotations that are significantly less correlated with the experts' annotations than the experts' annotations are correlated with each other. These results demonstrate that algorithms based on ITA-FST are not reliable for annotating large-scale image datasets, but human-centered, crowd-based protocols can reliably add skin type transparency to dermatology datasets. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of dynamic consensus protocols with tunable parameters including expert review that increase the visibility of crowdwork and provide guidance for future crowdsourced annotations of large image datasets.",CrossRef,100.0,Goal 17,0.008073525618260071,False,

For workers who test positive for malaria, the treatment of illness principally increases labor supply, leading to higher earnings. For workers who test negative, the health information leads to increased earnings via augmented daily productivity. This productivity response arises, in part, from selection into higher return tasks within their job at the plantation. The results underline the importance of medical treatment but also of improved access to information about one's health status, as the absence of either leads workers to work less or choose lower return tasks when working.",CrossRef,100.0,Goal 3,0.06322931415380817,True,malaria

The OR manager has access to historical case count and case length data, and needs to balance the fixed cost of baseline staff and variable cost of overtime, while satisfying surgeons’ preferences. Academic/practical relevance: ORs are costly to operate and generate about 70% of hospitals’ revenues from surgical operations and subsequent hospitalizations. Because hospitals are increasingly under pressure to reduce costs, it is important to make staffing and scheduling decisions in an optimal manner. Also, hospitals need to leverage data when developing algorithmic solutions, and model tradeoffs between staffing costs and surgeons’ preferences. We present a methodology for doing so, and test it on real data from a hospital. Methodology: We propose a new criterion called the robust competitive ratio for designing online algorithms. Using this criterion and a robust optimization approach to model the uncertainty in case mix and case lengths, we develop tractable optimization formulations to solve the staffing and scheduling problems. Results: For the staffing problem, we show that algorithms belonging to the class of interval classification algorithms achieve the best robust competitive ratio, and develop a tractable approach for calculating the optimal parameters of our proposed algorithm. For the scheduling phase, which occurs one or two days before each surgery day, we demonstrate how a robust optimization framework may be used to find implementable schedules while taking into account surgeons’ preferences such as back-to-back and same-OR scheduling of cases. We also perform numerical experiments with real and synthetic data, which show that our approach can significantly reduce total staffing cost.

This study critically examines RBMs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to create synthetic data that mimics the intricate behaviors of financial datasets like market volatility, price couplings, and time lags to perfection. Furthermore, this research introduces the use of Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence) as a measure to evaluate that how distant the synthetic data is from the real financial data. The operative nature of KL-Divergence allows one to ascertain how well the synthetic data can emulate the true underpinning distribution of actual finance data. Results indicate that Real and Fake achieved a skewed distribution peaking at 25 with density coverage fluctuating from − 0.50 to 1.25 using Python software. The results reveal that the integration of synthetic data generated reporting by R.B.M. and other generative models into training datasets can substantially improve model performance, even under market conditions that tend to flip-flop or show rarity.

Indeed, many product brands have added services in order to create more opportunity for customer interaction. This paper deals with the strategic use of customer interactions to build a strong brand. Customer interaction strategy has evolved considerably beyond traditional sales and advertising in how customer interactions are conducted. Yet the Pareto rule (e.g. 80% of sales from 20% of customers) continues to guide who brands interact with. Conventional wisdom is that firms should target heavy users or customers high on the recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) value of purchases. The purpose of this conceptual paper is to examine how brands can use brand purpose and brand communities to target light users and even nonuser stakeholders as well. Design/methodology/approach There is reason to hypothesize that brands can go beyond the heavy user limit of targeting customer interactions by developing brands around purpose. Purpose can be based on engagement with personal goals or values or on societal values about doing good for others. Brand purpose can be reinforced by either life purpose brand communities or societal purpose brand communities. Findings The paper reviews findings in the brand interaction, brand purpose and brand communities literature. Research limitations/implications The two types of brand purposes and brand communities offer the possibility of growing a brand by targeting customer interactions at light users and nonuser stakeholders. Practical implications There are important future research issues to be addressed, but this approach could increase the value of brands to consumers and extend the life cycle of brands for organizations. Social implications Furthermore, the concept of societal brand purpose could allow firms to focus on creating shareholder value as well as addressing social and environmental problems.

We leverage the geometric properties of the grid graph, which captures the road network structure in many transportation problems, including our motivating setting of school bus routing. As defined in this paper, the CPPG is a biobjective optimization problem comprising one cost term related to path length and one cost term related to stop count. We develop a trade-off constraint, which quantifies the trade-off between path length and stop count and provides a lower bound for the biobjective optimization problem. We introduce simple construction techniques to provide feasible paths that match the lower bound within a constant factor. Importantly, this solution approach uses transformations of the general CPPG to either a discrete CPPG or continuous CPPG based on the value of the coverage radius. For both the discrete and continuous versions, we provide fast constant-factor approximations, thus solving the general CPPG.",CrossRef,100.0,Goal 17,0.01008261514009712,False,

How do activists gain allies in the targeted institutions they hope to change? Despite recognition of the importance of ally support in theories about institutional change and social movements, these theories are largely silent on the microdynamics of ally mobilization. We examine how the labeling of organizational policies that benefit women influences potential workplace allies’ support for these policies. We theorize that one barrier to mobilizing workplace allies is a misalignment of the labels that activists use to promote new policies and employees’ affiliation with collective identities. We conducted five experiments to test our hypotheses and 26 qualitative interviews to provide illustration of our core concepts. We demonstrate that employees high in feminist identification are more likely to support feminist-labeled (feminist and #MeToo) than unlabeled policies, whereas those low in feminist identification are less likely to support feminist-labeled than unlabeled policies (Studies 1–3). However, we find that participants for whom organizational identification was high (whether measured or manipulated) and feminist identification was low supported organizationally labeled policies more than feminist-labeled polices (Studies 4 and 5). This illustrates that policies whose aims may not align with one collective identity can still garner support by activating another relevant collective identity. Within our studies, we provide evidence that these effects are mediated via feelings of pride in the organization (and not fear or anger), suggesting that positive emotions are a central mechanism in mobilizing workplace allies.

Customers can learn from the inventory level and update their beliefs about the product. Thus, consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by the availability information. Based on a unique setting from Amazon lightning deals, which displays the percentage of inventory consumed in real time, we explore whether and how consumers learn from inventory availability information. Identifying the effect of learning on consumer decisions has been a notoriously difficult empirical question because of endogeneity concerns. We address this issue by running two randomized field experiments on Amazon in which we create exogenous shocks on the inventory availability information for a random subset of Amazon lightning deals. In addition, we track the dynamic purchasing behavior and inventory information for 23,665 lightning deals offered by Amazon and use their panel structure to further explore the relative effect of learning. We find evidence of consumers learning from inventory information: a decrease in product availability causally attracts more sales in the future; in particular, a 10% increase in past claims leads to a 2.08% increase in cart add-ins in the next hour. Moreover, we show that buyers use observable product characteristics to moderate their inferences when learning from others; a deep discount weakens the learning momentum, whereas a good product rating amplifies the learning momentum.

While existing literature has shown that the exogenous effects (e.g., product and customer attributes) are deciding factors in customers’ consideration decisions, it is not clear how the endogenous effects (e.g., the intercompetition among products) would influence such decisions. This paper presents a network‐based approach based on Exponential Random Graph Models to study customers’ consideration behaviors according to engineering design. Our proposed approach is capable of modeling the endogenous effects among products through various network structures (e.g., stars and triangles) besides the exogenous effects and predicting whether two products would be conisdered together. To assess the proposed model, we compare it against the dyadic network model that only considers exogenous effects. Using buyer survey data from the China automarket in 2013 and 2014, we evaluate the goodness of fit and the predictive power of the two models. The results show that our model has a better fit and predictive accuracy than the dyadic network model.

Objectives To evaluate whether promotional language in biomedical grant writing is associated with receipt of funding and to assess who uses promotional language in their grant applications, after accounting for principal investigators (PIs), grants, and other confounders. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study uses previously collected data on 2439 funded and rejected National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant applications from 2007 to 2019 and 9096 funded and rejected Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF) biomedical grant applications from 2015 to 2022, bibliographic data on the publications of each PI from OpenAlex, and fixed-effects regression analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Promotional language was measured using a validated dictionary of 139 science-specific terms. Grant application success was modeled as a binary outcome and was based on the percentage of promotional words, controlling for variables including characteristics of grants and PIs. The level of promotional words was modeled on the PI’s grant-related characteristics. Results Of the 11 535 grants included in this study, the percentage of promotional words was positively associated with the probability of receiving funding (NNF grants: odds ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.25-1.71]; NIH grants: odds ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.10-2.11]).

Conclusions and Relevance This study found that the percentage of promotional language used in medical science grants was positively associated with receiving funding after accounting for PI, grant, and year confounds and that younger PIs, men PIs, and PIs requesting higher amounts of funding generally used more promotional language in their grants.

We find that while the relationship between reward/aversion and attention is functionally invariant, a power law formulation akin to the Cobb-Douglas production function in economics provides the best model fit and theoretical explanation for the interaction. These results indicate that a decreasing signal-to-noise with signal detection results in higher loss aversion.

This lowered degree of support is evidenced by reduced information search, the use of fewer rational-based arguments, and a greater reliance on more concise language. In contrast, for receivers, power increases consumers’ expectations for others to justify their positions. As a result, high-power receivers require a greater degree of support in communications from others.

Following an experience of regulatory fit (vs. nonfit), participants with moral predispositions were more likely to consider the decision to engage in sexual intercourse outside a committed relationship as a moral issue (Study 1), and were less willing to do so (Study 2); they also expressed higher intentions of reporting income honestly for tax purposes (Study 3), imposed harsher punishment on a transgressor (Study 4), and self-sacrificed more for the common good in a social dilemma (Studies 4 and 5).

This article argues that there is not a conflict between antitrust policy and technology
standards. A better understanding of the economic role of technology standards suggests that
standard setting increases competition in product markets and markets for inventions. SSOs
and technology standards are vital for entrepreneurs seeking to apply new technologies and to
establish innovative firms. This implies that antitrust authorities should view antitrust policy
and technology standards as complementary. ",CrossRef,98.6500655307994,Goal 17,0.04501291151356106,False,

In practice, customers typically respond to delay announcements by either balking or by becoming more or less impatient, and their response alters system performance. We study the accuracy of the LES announcement in single-class, multiserver Markovian queueing models with announcement-dependent customer behavior. We show that, interestingly, even in this stylized setting, the LES announcement may not always be accurate. This motivates the need to study its accuracy carefully and to determine conditions under which it is accurate. Since the direct analysis of the system with customer response is prohibitively difficult, we focus on many-server, heavy-traffic analysis instead. We consider the quality-and-efficiency-driven and efficiency-driven many-server, heavy-traffic regimes and prove, under both regimes, that the LES prediction is asymptotically accurate if and only if asymptotic fluctuations in the queue length process are small as long as some regulatory conditions apply. This result provides an easy check for the accuracy of LES announcements in practice.

However, the effect of economic downturns on Medicare spending is less clear. In contrast to studies involving earlier time periods, our study found that when the macroeconomy slowed during the Great Recession of 2007–09, so did Medicare spending growth. A small (14 percent) but significant share of the decline in Medicare spending growth from 2009 to 2012 relative to growth from 2004 to 2009 can be attributed to lingering effects of the recession. Absent the economic downturn, Medicare spending would have been $4 billion higher in 2009–12. A major reason for the relatively small impact of the macroeconomy is the relative lack of labor-force participation among people ages sixty-five and older.

Here we examine the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying distal simulation by studying individuals known for transcending these limits: creative experts. First, 2 behavioral studies establish that creative experts indeed succeed at engaging in vivid distal simulations, compared to less creative individuals. Performance on a traditional measure of creativity (Study 1) and real-world success in creative pursuits (Study 2) corresponded with more vivid distal simulations across temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical domains. Study 3 used neuroimaging to identify the neural mechanism supporting creative experts' simulation success. Whereas creative experts and controls recruit the same neural mechanism (the medial prefrontal cortex) while simulating common or proximal events, creative experts preferentially engage a distinct neural mechanism (the dorsomedial subsystem of the default network) while simulating distal events. Moreover, creative experts showed greater functional connectivity within this network at rest, suggesting they may be prepared to engage this mechanism, by default.

While traditional work in social and political psychology has held that conservatives display greater outgroup hostility than liberals, the worldview conflict perspective suggests that both groups similarly express hostility towards value incongruent outgroups. Contradicting both established perspectives, we present evidence across five preregistered studies (and two additional studies reported in the Supplements) conducted between 2022 and 2023—two social media field experiments (N = 10,000) examining actual behavior and five survey-based studies (N = 2,443) operationalizing partisan dislike in various ways (e.g., blocking on social media, rating the likability of various targets, and evaluating hiring suitability)—that Democrats (i.e., liberals) dislike Republicans (i.e., conservatives) more than vice versa. We provide a potential explanation for this phenomenon by extending the worldview conflict perspective to account for asymmetries in how moralized specific values are among two conflicting groups at a given point in time. Specifically, we theorize that in light of recent social trends in the modern-day U.S., the moralized belief that counter-partisans pose harm to disadvantaged groups has become an asymmetric contributor to partisan dislike among Democrats. We found support for our theory across both measurementof-mediation and experimental-mediation approaches, and in both field experimental and survey data. Overall, this work advances research on ideology and outgroup hostility and extends the worldview conflict perspective to better explain partisan dislike.

While prior work has examined ethical judgments toward inequality itself (e.g., “is inequality unethical?”), less is known about how inequality shapes judgments of unethical behavior (e.g., “is unethical behavior more acceptable?”). In two correlational studies, we find that higher objective (Study 1; n= 127,953) and subjective (Study 2; n= 806) inequality is associated with greater acceptability of self-interested unethical behavior. In Studies 3a–6b (total N = 4,851; preregistered), we manipulated perceived inequality and test several mediating pathways. Results point toward the importance of sense of control as a mechanism: Under conditions of high inequality, individuals report a lower sense of control, which increases the acceptability of self-interested unethical behaviors. As a supplement, we also explore associations regarding why high inequality reduces sense of control (reduced perceptions of social mobility) and why sense of control is associated with greater acceptability of unethical behavior (greater situational attributions). Overall, our results suggest inequality changes ethical standards by reducing one’s sense of control, providing evidence for another pathway through which inequality harms societies.",CrossRef,96.9135802469136,Goal 10,0.2183756737957613,True,economic inequality; education inequality; healthcare inequality; income inequality; political inequality; social inequality; within-country inequality

This study examines workplace communication and interactions before and after the expansion. Methods We conducted regression analyses using a unique dataset merging email communications, badge swipes, office locations and organisation charts for individuals that routinely use the treatment planning room (n=232). We use a difference-in-differences framework to compare individuals’ behaviours before and after the expansion. Our dependent variables were how often individuals accessed the treatment planning room and email volumes between two individuals. Findings We find an overall decrease in the use of the treatment planning room, though the effect was larger for those that moved away from it. Further, we find an increase in email communication for dyads of individuals separated in the move, but only if they belonged to different departments. Practical implications Our research points to complex interdependencies among healthcare providers, shedding light on how hospital expansion may have unintended consequences.

Nave et al. reported a single experiment and claimed that exogenous testosterone causes a decrease in CRT performance. Authors report three new experiments that also examined the effect of exogenous testosterone on CRT performance. When pooling the data across experiments, authors found (a) substantial variation in CRT performance across experiments, treatment groups, and participants and (b) variable treatment effects of testosterone on CRT performance across experiments, with any average effect being weak relative to this underlying variability—regardless of whether we considered the three new experiments or all four. The extent of this relative variability suggests that the notion of the effect of testosterone on CRT performance is not particularly meaningful. Instead, to the degree that testosterone does affect CRT performance, potential moderators that drive this variability would seem to be of greater interest. Authors urge caution in interpreting our moderation results, particularly given the number of experiments, the sample sizes of the experiments, and the number of moderator variables examined. We also note that we examined the moderating effects only of variables studied either by Nave et al. or in testosterone research more broadly; other variables may moderate the effect of testosterone on CRT performance. Nonetheless, insofar as future research continues to examine the effects of testosterone treatment on cognitive reflection—perhaps in search of such moderators—their results suggest the need for something akin to a “one phenomenon, many labs” approach that features systematic variation of methodological-difference variables and examines potential moderating effects of relevant variables in larger and more diverse samples.

According to industry reports, retrials are listed as a top annoying issue for customers and hurt call centers’ profits. Though recognizing this problem, call centers find it challenging to reduce retrials without overshooting their operating expenses. Our research aims to empirically understand the mechanism of customer retrials and then provide economically feasible solutions to reduce retrials. Academic/practical relevance: Little empirical research has been done to understand customers’ strategic retrials, and theoretical research studies retrials by assuming the degree to which pickup speed and service quality impact retrials. Our research empirically investigates the mechanism of customer retrials by studying whether speed and quality truly matter and, if so, how strong the impact is from each of them and whether the impacts are different across various customer segments. The quantified mechanism can then guide service providers to reduce retrials cost-effectively. Methodology: We use a random-coefficient dynamic structural model to characterize customer decisions in pursuing a satisfactory resolution and estimate the parameters from call-by-call records of a uniquely designed call center. Our model tracks customer decisions in the online waiting stage, in which customers are waiting for an agent but weighing whether to abandon, and in the off-line waiting stage, in which customers are not directly connected but are actively debating whether to retry. Utilizing the hybrid system that sequentially places customers into queues for three distinct quality service groups, we disentangle the effects of pickup speed and service quality on customers’ abandonment and retrial decisions. Results: Our estimations confirm that high service quality and quick pickup speed reduce retrials. Moreover, we discover that private customers are more sensitive to quality but less sensitive to speed compared with business customers. We suggest two service designs to reduce retrials cost-effectively by tailoring services to customer preferences. One reallocates the service groups for different customer segments without expanding the system, and the other adjusts the staffing ratios by hiring low-cost, ordinary-quality agents. Under the two tailoring designs, business customer surplus increases by up to 14.4% and private customer surplus by up to 14.9%. Managerial implications: First, our research highlights the importance of recognizing customers’ off-line decisions, which are impacted by online service offerings and, in turn, affect future online service operations. Neglecting customer retrials leads to suboptimal service designs. Second, by understanding the mechanism of customer retrials empirically, our research guides call centers to reduce retrials cost-effectively with speed–quality balance. Third, our research develops a practical analysis framework for service providers to quantify customer preferences and design tailoring services.",CrossRef,95.3125,Goal 1,0.0122524713755646,False,

Few studies have investigated how romantic desire during initial interactions predicts later relational outcomes (e.g., later romantic interest, contact attempts) using a design that can tease apart different possible mechanisms (e.g., mate value, selectivity, compatibility). Across three speed-dating studies ( n = 559) with longitudinal follow-ups (including college and community samples, and a sample of men who date men), we investigated whether different components of initial romantic impressions predicted later romantic outcomes and relationship initiation. Using the social relations model, we partitioned initial desire at speed dating (determined from 6,600+ total dates) into partner effects (a date’s consensual desirability, e.g., mate value), actor effects (a participant’s general desirousness, e.g., selectivity), and relationship effects (a participant’s unique liking for a date over and beyond partner and actor effects, e.g., compatibility) to predict later evaluations (romantic interest, physical attraction, and desire to know better) and behaviors (direct messaging and going on dates). Meta-analyses across the three studies showed that, across 6,100+ follow-up reports, partner and relationship effects were especially strong predictors of relationship initiation variables.

Contrary to the Matthew effect, the reputational decline is the steepest for those who had the highest reputations while alive.

Finkel; P. Eastwick; H. Reis,2017,"Finkel, Eastwick, and Reis (2015; FER2015) argued that psychological science is better served by responding to apprehensions about replicability rates with contextualized solutions than with one-size-fits-all solutions. Here, we extend FER2015's analysis to suggest that much of the discussion of best research practices since 2011 has focused on a single feature of high-quality science-replicability-with insufficient sensitivity to the implications of recommended practices for other features, like discovery, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, consequentiality, and cumulativeness. Thus, although recommendations for bolstering replicability have been innovative, compelling, and abundant, it is difficult to evaluate their impact on our science as a whole, especially because many research practices that are beneficial for some features of scientific quality are harmful for others. For example, FER2015 argued that bigger samples are generally better, but also noted that very large samples (""those larger than required for effect sizes to stabilize""; p. 291) could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies. In their critique of FER2015, LeBel, Campbell, and Loving (2016) concluded, based on simulated data, that ever-larger samples are better for the efficiency of scientific discovery (i.e., that there are no tradeoffs). As demonstrated here, however, this conclusion holds only when the replicator's resources are considered in isolation. If we widen the assumptions to include the original researcher's resources as well, which is necessary if the goal is to consider resource investment for the field as a whole, the conclusion changes radically-and strongly supports a tradeoff-based analysis. In general, as psychologists seek to strengthen our science, we must complement our much-needed work on increasing replicability with careful attention to the other features of a high-quality science.

Here, building on previous research relating to innovation1,2,3,4,5,6,7, human dynamics8,9,10,11 and learning12,13,14,15,16,17, we develop a simple one-parameter model that mimics how successful future attempts build on past efforts. Solving this model analytically suggests that a phase transition separates the dynamics of failure into regions of progression or stagnation and predicts that, near the critical threshold, agents who share similar characteristics and learning strategies may experience fundamentally different outcomes following failures. Above the critical point, agents exploit incremental refinements to systematically advance towards success, whereas below it, they explore disjoint opportunities without a pattern of improvement. The model makes several empirically testable predictions, demonstrating that those who eventually succeed and those who do not may initially appear similar, but can be characterized by fundamentally distinct failure dynamics in terms of the efficiency and quality associated with each subsequent attempt. We collected large-scale data from three disparate domains and traced repeated attempts by investigators to obtain National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants to fund their research, innovators to successfully exit their startup ventures, and terrorist organizations to claim casualties in violent attacks. We find broadly consistent empirical support across all three domains, which systematically verifies each prediction of our model.

Challenging this idea, we propose that one reason why people from working-class contexts underperform is because U.S. measures of achievement tend to assess people individually. We theorize that working together on measures of achievement will create a cultural match with the interdependent selves common among people from working-class contexts, therefore improving their sense of fit and performance. We further theorize that effective group processes will serve as a mechanism that helps to explain when and why working together affords these benefits. Four studies utilizing diverse methods support our theorizing. Using archival data on college student grades, Study 1 finds that groups with higher proportions of students from working-class contexts perform better. Utilizing a nationally representative sample of collegiate student-athletes, Study 2 suggests that the benefits of working together for people from working-class contexts are moderated by whether groups engage in effective group processes. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrate that working together (vs. individually) causally improves the fit and performance of people from working-class contexts. Study 4 identifies effective group processes as a mediator: People from working-class (vs. middle-class) contexts more frequently engage in effective group processes, thus improving their performance. Our findings suggest that assessing achievement individually is not class-neutral.

Huang; R. Greenbaum; Julena Bonner; Cynthia Wang,2018,"We utilize the social intuitionist approach to moral judgment and moral disengagement theory to understand why and when employees sabotage customers. We contend that when customers mistreat employees (i.e., customer mistreatment), employees experience intuitive emotional reactions in the form of hostility, which automatically activates devaluation of targets, a specific facet of moral disengagement. In turn, employees become unencumbered by moral self-regulation and sabotage customers who mistreat them (i.e., customer-directed sabotage). We further argue that our serially mediated model is moderated by employees’ perceptions of the organization’s ethical climate. When ethical climates are perceived as being low, employees’ hostile reactions toward misbehaving customers produce a positive relationship with devaluation of targets, and devaluation of targets results in a positive relationship with customer-directed sabotage. These positive relationships do not hold when ethical climate is perceived as being high. We test our theoretical model using a field sample of customer service employees and an experimental study to establish causality. Our results provide general support for our hypotheses.

Although one still needs Stein factor bounds, they now correspond to finite differences of the Markov chain Poisson equation solution rather than the derivatives of the solution to the diffusion Poisson equation.

In higher education, one critical driver of these disparities is the cultural mismatch between the interdependent norms of people from working-class backgrounds and the independent norms that pervade higher education. However, after graduating from college and entering white-collar workplaces, people from working-class backgrounds have frequent opportunities to collaborate in teams-that is, to enact interdependent behavior. Do these opportunities reduce cultural mismatch for people from working-class backgrounds? Across two survey studies and two experiments with college-educated U.S. employees (total N = 2,566), we find that they do not. We theorize and document that this is because there is often a decoupling between enacting interdependent behavior and whether such behavior is valued as part of being a ""good"" employee. We find that employees from working-class backgrounds only experience a cultural match and its benefits (e.g., sense of fit, high retention intentions) when interdependent behaviors are both enacted and valued. In contrast, when interdependent behaviors are enacted but not valued, employees from working-class backgrounds experience a cultural mismatch. Furthermore, we find that this pattern is unique to employees from working-class backgrounds: Employees from middle-class backgrounds report similar fit and retention regardless of whether there is a coupling of enacted and valued interdependent behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that it is critical to examine multiple elements of culture simultaneously (e.g., both enacted and valued behavior) to fully understand and predict the consequences of cultural (mis)match.

Based on 2 competing conceptualizations in the literature, that behavior is reciprocated ""in-kind"" in an eye for an eye exchange or that behavior tends to escalate or spiral over time, we develop a framework for negative reciprocity that considers NWB in terms of severity, activity, and target. This framework addresses (a) whether Party A's NWB is associated with behavior of a similar or greater level (i.e., activity and severity) from Party B; and (b) whether Party B's reciprocating behavior is directed back at Party A (i.e., direct) or transferred onto others (i.e., displaced). We meta-analytically test these relationships with 246 independent samples (N = 96,930) and find strongest support for relationships indicating that NWB from Party A is largely returned in-kind, followed closely by relationships indicative of escalation. We also found that as the frequency of Party A's NWB increases, so too does the frequency of reciprocity behavior of equal levels.

Difference-education interventions improve first-generation students' performance by empowering them to navigate higher education environments more effectively.

First, is difference-education effective in improving first-generation students' academic performance in lower-resourced institutions, and does it do so by increasing empowerment? Second, does difference-education improve comfort with social group difference in lower-resourced institutions, and is it unique in its ability to do so?

Specifically, we analyze how a focal firm's innovation performance is shaped by its political stakeholders (local and central governments) and economic stakeholders (suppliers, buyers, and competitors). Using a data set consisting of over 26,400 Chinese firms, we first find support for our predictions that a focal firm's innovation performance will be enhanced by both its government connections and the innovativeness of its economic stakeholders. We then analyze whether the interdependent effect of these political and economic stakeholders is more likely to be synergistic versus antagonistic, and find evidence consistent with the antagonistic view. Managerial Summary We show how a firm's innovativeness is influenced strongly by its relationships to external stakeholders. Specifically, we examine the potentially dual‐edged role of political stakeholders (local and central governments) and economic stakeholders (suppliers, buyers, and competitors). Using extensive data on Chinese firms, we find: (a) that the higher the level of government connections, the greater a firm's innovativeness; (b) that firms located in proximity with more innovative economic stakeholders also tend to have higher innovation performance. We also look beyond these independent positive effects to examine the joint effect of these two forms of stakeholder influence, and here we see that more influence is not always better.

This article begins by reviewing research that highlights two distinct understandings of social-group differences—as contextual or essential—and demonstrates their consequences for intergroup outcomes. We then review research on multicultural and social justice education that highlights the potential benefits of educating students about social-group differences. We propose that these educational approaches are associated with intergroup and academic benefits for one key reason: They teach students a contextual theory of difference. Finally, to illustrate and provide causal evidence for our theory of how a contextual understanding of difference affords these benefits, this article provides an overview of the first social psychological intervention to teach students a contextual understanding of difference: difference-education.",CrossRef,92.72727272727273,Goal 4,0.05791219000664249,True,cultural diversity

Two forms of dependence mechanisms in service systems with customer abandonment are studied in this paper: First, the service requirement of a customer may evolve while waiting in queue. Second, customers may arrive to the system with an exogenous service and patience time that are stochastically dependent. Because either dependence mechanism can have significant impacts on a system's performance, it should be identified and taken into consideration for performance evaluation and decision-making purposes. However, identifying the source of dependence from observed data is hard because both the service times and patience times are censored due to customer abandonment. Further, even if the dependence is known to be the latter exogenous one, there remains the difficult task of fitting a joint service-patience times distribution to the censored data. In “When Service Times Depend on Customers’ Delays: A Relationship Between Two Models of Dependence”, Wu, Bassamboo, and Perry provide a solution to address these statistical challenges.",CrossRef,92.5925925925926,Goal 17,0.008300179163207185,False,

Our research introduces social uncertainty as a unifying lens to understand the reluctance of these employees to express their social identity. Highlighting the central role of social uncertainty also helps identify novel factors at both the organizational level (authenticity climates) and individual level (perspective-taking) that can encourage Black employees to engage in social identity affirmation—authentic expressions of the positive aspects of their social identity. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two survey studies, two experiments, qualitative interviews, as well as coded text responses to our experimental prompts. Across our studies, authenticity climates were associated with greater social identity affirmation by Black employees, and this relationship was strengthened when these employees engaged in perspective-taking. Consistent with our theorizing, social certainty mediated these direct and moderated effects. In addition, social identity affirmation increased Black employees’ organizational involvement. Our experimental studies offer causal evidence for the roles of both authenticity climates and Black employees’ perspective-taking, our qualitative interviews vividly illuminate our hypotheses, and our text response analyses provide insight into how authenticity climates operate. Overall, the current research highlights how organizations can help Black employees feel comfortable emphasizing and expressing their true selves by increasing their social certainty. These findings also have direct implications for organizational leaders, providing them with actionable strategies to create more inclusive environments.

Guidelines define standards for data citation, transparency of data, material, code and design and analysis, replication, plan and study pre-registration, and two effective interventions: “Registered reports” and “Open science badges”, and levels of adoption summed up across standards define journal’s TOP Factor. In this paper, we analysed the status of adoption of TOP guidelines across two thousand journals reported in the TOP Factor metrics.

The simplest of these is the two-sided queue with servers on one side and customers on the other, both arriving dynamically over time and abandoning if not matched by the time their patience elapses. We identify nonasymptotic and universal scaling laws for the matching loss due to abandonment, which we refer to as the “cost of impatience.” The scaling laws characterize the way in which this cost depends on the arrival rates and the (possibly different) mean patience of servers and customers. Our characterization reveals four operating regimes identified by an operational measure of patience that brings together mean patience and utilization. The four regimes subsume the regimes that arise in asymptotic (heavy-traffic) approximations. The scaling laws, specialized to each regime, reveal the fundamental structure of the cost of impatience and show that its order of magnitude is fully determined by (i) a “winner-take-all” competition between customer impatience and utilization, and (ii) the ability to accumulate inventory on the server side. Practically important is that when servers are impatient, the cost of impatience is, up to an order of magnitude, given by an insightful expression where only the minimum of the two patience rates appears. Considering the trade-off between abandonment and capacity costs, we characterize the scaling of the optimal safety capacity as a function of costs, arrival rates, and patience parameters. We prove that the ability to hold inventory of servers means that the optimal safety capacity grows logarithmically in abandonment cost and, in turn, slower than the square-root growth in the single-sided queue.

ROP rates and blindness from ROP are higher in low-income and middle-income countries, where exposure to risk factors can be higher and where detection and treatment of ROP are under-resourced or non-existent. Access to low-cost imaging devices would improve remote screening capabilities for ROP. Methods Target product profiles (TPPs) are developed early in the medical device development process to define the setting, target user and range of product requirements. A Delphi-like process, consisting of an online survey and consensus meeting, was used to develop a TPP for an ROP imaging device, collecting feedback on a proposed set of 64 product requirements. Results Thirty-six stakeholders from 17 countries provided feedback: clinicians (72%), product developers (14%), technicians (6%) and other (8%). Thirty-six per cent reported not currently screening for ROP, with cited barriers including cost (44%), no training (17%) and poor image quality (16%).

The setting is motivated by information markets in which (i) sellers have the ability to offer information products of different qualities and (ii) the information product provides potential buyers not only with more precise information about the fundamentals, but also with a coordination device that can be used in their strategic interactions with their competitors. Our results illustrate that the nature and intensity of competition among the information provider’s customers play first-order roles in determining the information provider’s optimal strategy. We show that when the customers view their actions as strategic complements, the provider finds it optimal to offer the most accurate information at the provider’s disposal to all potential customers. In contrast, when buyers view their actions as strategic substitutes, the provider maximizes the provider’s profits by either (i) restricting the overall supply of the information product or (ii) distorting its content by offering a product of inferior quality.

Our goal is to study the impact of such dependence on key performance measures, such as expected waiting times and average queue length, as well as on optimal capacity decisions. Since the dependence structure renders exact analysis intractable, we employ a stationary fluid approximation that is based on the entire joint distribution of the service and patience times. Our results show that even moderate dependence has significant impacts on system performance, so considering the patience and service times to be independent when they are in fact dependent is futile. We further demonstrate that Pearson’s correlation coefficient, which is commonly used to measure and rank dependence, is an insufficient statistic, and that the entire joint distribution is required for comparative statics. Thus, we propose a novel framework, incorporating the fluid model with bivariate dependence orders and copulas, to study the impacts of the aforementioned dependence. We then demonstrate how that framework can be applied to facilitate revenue optimization when staffing and abandonment costs are incurred. Finally, the effectiveness of the fluid-based approximations and optimal-staffing prescriptions is demonstrated via simulations.

Specifically, we develop an index on the severity of the agency conflict and investigate whether this index explains the quality of governance structures. We also examine whether, given certain environmental complementarities, this index influences the effectiveness of good governance structures. Research Findings/Insights: Using a simultaneous equations model, we find that the conflict index affects the quality and effectiveness of corporate governance. When agency conflicts are severe, the costs of installing good governance are high for the majority shareholders and the quality is low. Once installed, however, good governance structures complemented with a high‐quality disclosure environment leads to higher firm value, especially in companies with a severe agency conflict. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study adds to the governance literature by focusing on the costs of installing good governance. Further, it contributes to principal‐principal agency studies by examining a number of developed countries and by developing a measure for the severity of the principal‐principal conflict. Finally, our study adds to institutional theory by showing how companies' corporate governance choices are affected by the severity of agency conflicts and the way corporate governance is regulated. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our analyses suggest that regulatory approaches to corporate governance issues should move away from a “one‐size‐fits‐all” policy toward one that takes into account the organizational and environmental context.

CDS investments can modify lenders׳ payoffs on their loan portfolios by providing insurance on negative credit outcomes. The onset of CDS trading reduces lenders׳ incentives to continuously monitor borrowers and also their demand that borrowers report conservatively. Additionally, borrowers expect CDS-insured lenders to be more intransigent in renegotiations triggered by defaults and covenant violations. Since conservatism can trigger earlier covenant violations, borrowers have heightened incentives to report less conservatively in the post-CDS period. Using a differences-in-differences research design, we observe a decline in borrowing firms׳ reporting conservatism after CDS trade initiation. This effect is more pronounced when reputation costs lenders face from reducing monitoring are lower, when debt contracts outstanding at the time of CDS trade initiation have more financial covenants, and when lenders who monitor borrowers more regularly in the pre-CDS period enter into CDS contracts to hedge their credit exposures.",CrossRef,90.8163265306122,Goal 17,0.02550406397717744,False,

In recent years, research aimed at identifying and relating the antecedents and consequences of diffusing organizational practices/ideas has turned its attention to debating the international adoption and implementation of the Anglo-American model of corporate governance, i.e., a shareholder value orientation (SVO). While financial economists characterize the adoption of an SVO as necessary and performance-enhancing, behavioral scientists have disputed such claims, invoking institutional contingencies in the appropriateness of an SVO. Our study seeks to provide some resolution to the debate by developing an overarching sociopolitical perspective that links the antecedents and consequences of the adoption of the contested practice of SVO.

Research Findings/Insights
We test our framework using extensive longitudinal data from 1992–2006 from the largest listed corporations in the Netherlands. We find a negative relationship between SVO adoption and subsequent firm performance, although this effect is attenuated when accompanied by greater SVO alignment among major owners and a firm's visible commitment to an SVO.

Theoretical/Academic Implications
This study extends prior research on the diffusion of contested organizational practices that has taken a sociopolitical perspective by offering an original contingency perspective that addresses how and why the misaligned preferences of corporate owners will affect (i) a company's inclination to espouse an SVO, and (ii) the performance consequences of such misalignment.

Practitioner/Policy Implications
This study suggests that, when board members are considering the adoption of new ideas/practices (e.g., SVO), they should consider the contextual fitness of the idea/practice with the firm's owners and their interests.",CrossRef,90.7692307692308,Goal 17,0.01330550616465057,False,

Here we assess 747 pandemic-related research articles that empirically investigated those claims. We report the scale of evidence and whether evidence supports them to indicate applicability for policymaking. Two independent teams, involving 72 reviewers, found evidence for 18 of 19 claims, with both teams finding evidence supporting 16 (89%) of those 18 claims. The strongest evidence supported claims that anticipated culture, polarization and misinformation would be associated with policy effectiveness. Claims suggesting trusted leaders and positive social norms increased adherence to behavioural interventions also had strong empirical support, as did appealing to social consensus or bipartisan agreement. Targeted language in messaging yielded mixed effects and there were no effects for highlighting individual benefits or protecting others. No available evidence existed to assess any distinct differences in effects between using the terms ‘physical distancing’ and ‘social distancing’. Analysis of 463 papers containing data showed generally large samples; 418 involved human participants with a mean of 16,848 (median of 1,699).

Yet, our systematic understanding of the use of science in policy remains limited (1, 4-6), partly because of the difficulty in reliably tracing the coevolution of policy and science at a large, global scale (3). Today, the world faces a common emergency in the COVID-19 pandemic, which presents a dynamic, uncertain, yet extraordinarily consequential policy environment across the globe. We combined two large-scale databases that capture policy and science and their interactions, allowing us to examine the coevolution of policy and science during the pandemic. Our analysis suggests that many policy documents in the COVID-19 pandemic substantially access recent, peer-reviewed, and high-impact science. And policy documents that cite science are especially highly cited within the policy domain. At the same time, there is a heterogeneity in the use of science across policy-making institutions. The tendency for policy documents to cite science appears mostly concentrated within intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), such as the World Health Organization (WHO), and much less so in national governments, which consume science largely indirectly through the IGOs. This close coevolution between policy and science offers a useful indication that a key link is operating, but it has not been a sufficient condition for effectiveness in containing the pandemic.

We focus on two aspects of complexity: the length of financial reports and the complexity of financial reporting rules. We document that both aspects of complexity are positively associated with firms' reliance on bank financing (i.e., level of debt and new financing). This result is consistent with banks' superior information processing capabilities. Next, we document that banks ameliorate information frictions using loan contractual terms that depend on the source of complexity.

The problem studied in this paper is common in service applications, such as hotels, car rentals, and consulting services. These applications have limited capacity that must be allocated among incoming service requests. Different requests may require resources for varying durations, and some requests might yield higher rewards than others when fulfilled. The decision maker, who controls this capacity, must decide upon each request’s arrival whether to accept it (thus committing resources for a certain period) or reject it in order to reserve capacity for potentially more valuable future requests. This paper expands our understanding of such resource allocation problems by developing an appealingly simple dynamic allocation algorithm with proven effectiveness. In an appropriate operating regime, the suboptimal gap of this algorithm is at most logarithmic in the maximum achievable reward.

The choice of school start and end times is an optimization challenge, as schedules influence the district’s transportation system, and limiting the associated costs is a computationally difficult combinatorial problem. However, it is also a policy challenge, as transportation costs are far from the only consequence of school schedule changes. Policymakers need time and knowledge to balance these considerations and reach a consensus carefully; past implementations have failed because of policy issues, despite state-of-the-art optimization approaches. We first motivate our approach with a microfoundation model of the interplay between policymakers and researchers, arguing that limiting their dependency is key. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that includes (1) a fast algorithm capable of solving the school schedule problem that compares favorably to the literature and (2) an interactive optimization approach that leverages this speed to allow policymakers to explore a variety of solutions in a transparent and efficient way, facilitating the policy decision-making process.

These complex identities simultaneously impact social perceivers' impressions and social targets' own experiences of identity, thereby shaping perceptions, experiences, and interactions in fundamental ways. This review examines recent research on the perception and experience of the complex, multifaceted identities that both complicate and enrich our lives. Although research has historically tended to focus more on difficulties and challenges associated with multiple identities, increasing attention is being paid to opportunities that emerge from the possession of identities that include multiple distinct or overlapping groups. We consider how these opportunities might benefit both perceivers and targets.",CrossRef,90.1639344262295,Goal 1,0.03435594885705475,False,

In particular, we explain how cultural mismatch can fuel social-class disparities in higher education and professional workplaces. First, we explain how different social-class contexts tend to reflect and foster different cultural models of self. Second, we outline how higher education and professional workplaces often prioritize independence as the cultural ideal.

In this paper, we study the efficiency of a simple pure bundling mechanism in extracting the consumer surplus in the presence of nonnegative marginal costs and correlated valuations. The main question we address is how to quantify the benefits of adopting a simple pure bundling mechanism relative to other more complicated mechanisms, such as mixed bundling. We develop simple robust analytics that identify the main drivers for the efficiency of the pure bundling mechanism and allow the sellers to easily quantify the potential profit of a large‐scale bundling mechanism relative to more complicated selling mechanisms. Our numerical simulations show that these analytics provide high predictive power for the true performance of the bundling mechanism and are robust to different parametric assumptions even for relatively small bundles.

As a result, car sales in counties that traditionally depended on nonbank lenders declined sharply. Although other lenders increased their supply of credit, the net aggregate effect of illiquidity on car sales is large and negative. We conclude that the decline in auto sales during the financial crisis was caused in part by a credit supply shock driven by the illiquidity of the most important providers of consumer finance in the auto loan market.

In international negotiations, people may assume that high-trust nations are more likely to produce more trustworthy negotiators. Does this assumption hold universally? This study aims to address this research question by investigating the relationship between national-level societal trust and individual-level trust in negotiations. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a cross-sectional research design and a sample of 910 senior managers from 58 nations or regions. The hypotheses are tested by hierarchical linear modeling. Findings This study draws on the dynamic constructivist theory of culture to propose moderated hypotheses. Results show that societal trust predicts individuals’ social perceptions of attitudinal trust in negotiations, only when cultural face norms are weak rather than strong; societal trust predicts individuals’ social perceptions of behavioral trust in negotiations (i.e. high information sharing and low competitive behavior), only when negotiators process information analytically rather than holistically. Originality/value This study is the first to examine the relationship between national-level societal trust (i.e. generalized trust) and individual-level trust in negotiations (i.e. particularistic trust).

This demonstrates, in settings when individual productivity is observed, that physical activity measures can help disentangle productivity effects due to effort. When productivity is unobserved, physical activity measures may proxy for individual productivity in physically demanding tasks.

Here we analyse the determinants of cross-class interaction using data from Facebook, building on the analysis in our companion paper 7 . We show that about half of the social disconnection across socioeconomic lines—measured as the difference in the share of high-socioeconomic status (SES) friends between people with low and high SES—is explained by differences in exposure to people with high SES in groups such as schools and religious organizations. The other half is explained by friending bias—the tendency for people with low SES to befriend people with high SES at lower rates even conditional on exposure. Friending bias is shaped by the structure of the groups in which people interact. For example, friending bias is higher in larger and more diverse groups and lower in religious organizations than in schools and workplaces. Distinguishing exposure from friending bias is helpful for identifying interventions to increase cross-SES friendships (economic connectedness). Using fluctuations in the share of students with high SES across high school cohorts, we show that increases in high-SES exposure lead low-SES people to form more friendships with high-SES people in schools that exhibit low levels of friending bias. Thus, socioeconomic integration can increase economic connectedness in communities in which friending bias is low. By contrast, when friending bias is high, increasing cross-SES interactions among existing members may be necessary to increase economic connectedness.

Beyond the traditional descriptive analysis used in network analysis, we employ the exponential random graph model (ERGM) as a unified statistical inference framework to interpret complex preference decisions.

We analyze how and why evaluators’ interpretative process following instances of corporate misconduct will likely include not only inductive generalization (rooted in similarity judgments and prototype-based categorization) but also deductive generalizing (rooted in evaluators’ theories and causal-based categorization). We highlight the role and relevance of this neglected distinction by extending guilt-by-association predictions to include two unique predictions based on deductive generalization. First, we posit a recipient effect: if an innocent organization falls under a negative stereotype that causally links the innocent firm with corporate misconduct, then that innocent firm will suffer a greater negative spillover effect, irrespective of its similarity to the offending firm.

Across three experiments, we propose that group identification is a cause and consequence of self‐labeling with stigmatizing group labels, a practice known to reduce stigma. Experiment 1 found that group identification increased self‐labeling with a stigmatizing group label. In Experiment 2, individuals who self‐labeled with a stigmatizing group label felt more identified with their group, which reduced the label's perceived negativity; they also persisted longer on an in‐group helping task, an effect that was partially mediated by group identification. In Experiment 3, observers perceived self‐labelers as more identified with their group and as viewing the label less negatively; perceived group identification mediated the relationship. Group identification is a critical component in reappropriating stigmatizing labels and provides insight into how highly identified members can navigate group conflict by negotiating their group's identity.",CrossRef,87.93103448275862,Goal 16,0.01721313510852837,False,

It distinguishes the innovation adoption mechanisms of organizational-decision-makers (ODMs), who make authority adoption decisions on behalf of an organization, from individual-decision-makers (IDMs), who make optional innovation decisions in their own work practice. Drawing on the Theory of Reasoned Action and Social Information Processing Theory, we propose and test a theoretical model of interorganizational social influence. We surveyed government health-care workers, whose advice networks mostly span organizational boundaries, across 1,849 state health agencies in Bihar, India. The collective attitudes of coworkers and advice network members influence health-care workers’ attitudes and perceptions of social norms toward four types of innovations. However, individuals’ decision-making authority moderates these relationships; advisors’ attitudes have a greater influence on ODMs, while perceptions of social norms only influence IDMs. Notably, heterogeneity of advisors’ and coworkers’ attitudes negatively influence IDMs’ evaluations of innovations but not ODMs’.",CrossRef,87.83783783783784,Goal 3,0.0652255921684057,True,health workforce

It is desire's profound influence on human behavior that captures our attention. Desires can radically transform our thoughts, preferences, and actions. Conceptually, desire involves the conscious experience of wanting a certain object, person, or activity that will bring pleasure or relief from displeasure (Hofmann & Van Dillen, 2012). Functionally, desire provides the motivational impetus to engage in adaptive, goal-relevant behavior. Yet desire is perhaps best known for acting as a countervailing force to people's self-control efforts. Unrestrained desire contributes to a variety of well-known negative behavioral outcomes, such as obesity, infidelity, and aggression. Despite the profound changes to behavior that desire routinely produces, it seems that people have remarkably little insight into the influence desire has on their preferences and behavior. More specifically, people have tremendous difficulty imagining how they (or others) will behave in a state of desire that is different from what they are currently experiencing. When we are in an emotionally neutral or ""cold"" state, we have little appreciation for how we (and others) will behave when in an emotional or ""hot"" state. And when gripped by desire, we underestimate the extent to which the transient hot state, and not long-term dispositional preferences, is impacting our behavior. These ""hot-cold empathy gaps,"" as this phenomenon is known, have significant implications for how we perceive, evaluate, and make decisions surrounding desire. We begin our discussion by formally defining the hot-cold empathy gap. We next describe research demonstrating empathy gaps in a variety of domains relevant to desire. We then turn to behavioral implications of the empathy gap, focusing, for example, on how the empathy gap might compromise people's self-control efforts. We then consider the implications of the empathy gap for social judgments and behavior. We conclude with limitations, lingering questions, and opportunities for future empathy gap research.

This paper describes development and use of a planning and costing tool regarding furniture, fixtures and devices to support scale-up of WHO level-2 neonatal care, for national and global newborn survival targets. Methods We followed a systematic process. First, we reviewed planning and costing tools of relevance. Second, we co-designed a new tool to estimate furniture and device set-up costs for a default 40-bed level-2 neonatal unit, incorporating input from multi-disciplinary experts and newborn care guidelines. Furniture and device lists were based off WHO guidelines/norms, UNICEF and national manuals/guides. Due to lack of evidence-based quantification, ratios were based on operational manuals, multi-country facility assessment data, and expert opinion. Default unit costs were from government procurement agency costs in Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Third, we refined the tool by national use in Tanzania. Results The tool adapts activity-based costing (ABC) to estimate quantities and costs to equip a level-2 neonatal unit based on three components: (1) furniture/fixtures (18 default but editable items); (2) neonatal medical devices (16 product categories with minimum specifications for use in low-resource settings); (3) user training at device installation. The tool was used in Tanzania to generate procurement lists and cost estimates for level-2 scale-up in 171 hospitals (146 District and 25 Regional Referral). Total incremental cost of all new furniture and equipment acquisition, installation, and user training were US$93,000 per District hospital (level-2 care) and US$346,000 per Regional Referral hospital. Estimated cost per capita for whole-country district coverage was US$0.23, representing 0.57% increase in government health expenditure per capita and additional 0.35% for all Regional Referral hospitals. Conclusion Given 2.3 million neonatal deaths and potential impact of level-2 newborn care, rational and efficient planning of devices linked to systems change is foundational. In future iterations, we aim to include consumables, spare parts, and maintenance cost options. More rigorous implementation research data are crucial to formulating evidence-based ratios for devices numbers per baby. Use of this tool could help overcome gaps in devices numbers, advance efficiency and quality of neonatal care.",CrossRef,87.35632183908046,Goal 3,0.03755720706561869,False,health care costs; neonatal mortality

We develop and apply a novel instrumental variables framework to quantify the variation in causal mortality effects across plans and measure how much consumers attend to this variation. We first document large differences in the observed mortality rates of Medicare Advantage plans in local markets. We then show that when plans with high mortality rates exit these markets, enrollees tend to switch to more typical plans and subsequently experience lower mortality. We derive and validate a novel “fallback condition” governing the subsequent choices of those affected by plan exits. When the fallback condition is satisfied, plan terminations can be used to estimate the relationship between observed plan mortality rates and causal mortality effects. Applying the framework, we find that mortality rates unbiasedly predict causal mortality effects. We then extend our framework to study other predictors of plan mortality effects and estimate consumer willingness to pay. Higher-spending plans tend to reduce enrollee mortality, but existing quality ratings are uncorrelated with plan mortality effects. Consumers place little weight on mortality effects when choosing plans. Good insurance plans dramatically reduce mortality, and redirecting consumers to such plans could improve beneficiary health.",CrossRef,87.17948717948718,Goal 3,0.14231032673276,True,health coverage

However, our understanding of authenticity has tended to focus on the what—the attributes and content typically associated with authentic products, organizations, and experiences. We still lack a clear understanding of how audiences think about different aspects of authenticity and the mechanisms through which audiences’ perceptions affect outcomes. In this paper we conduct three studies to investigate what people mean when they evaluate an organization as authentic, and what consequences this has for their support for the organization. In study 1 we build on existing theoretical frameworks to empirically derive three dimensions of authenticity: moral, idiosyncratic, and categorical. Using an online survey in the empirical setting of nascent crowdfunding ventures, we test the effects of these dimensions on audience members’ funding decisions. We find that each of the authenticity dimensions proves significant for distinct support outcomes, notably by enhancing the likability (warmth) of the project and/or its creators in the minds of evaluators. Study 2 offers experimental support for the mediating role of likability—but not of assessments of competence—in explaining support for nascent organizations. Finally, study 3 provides evidence that regardless of which dimension of authenticity audiences draw on, the latter are positively related in their minds to an overall notion of authenticity.

The empirical analyses are based on a sample of 158 technology‐based firms from the United States and Germany across multiple industries. The results show that two important dimensions of patent management, specifically patent protection management and patent information management, are positively correlated with a firm's level of financial profitability and the strategic and financial impact of its patent portfolio. This implies that patent protection and information management are important managerial capabilities of the firm that determine the level of value it can create from patents. We further find that a firm's technology strategy moderates the relationship between patent protection management and firm performance; it does, however, not moderate the relationship between patent information management and firm performance. Hence, the effectiveness of certain managerial capabilities on value creation from patents are contingent upon specific boundary conditions.

We explore two waves of the survey that were fielded on Facebook in April 2020 and December 2020. We document five facts about the impact of the pandemic on small businesses. (1) Larger firms, older firms, and male-owned firms were more likely to remain open during the early stages of the pandemic with many of these heterogeneities persisting through the end of 2020. (2) At businesses that remained open, concerns about demand shocks outweighed concerns about supply shocks though the relative importance of supply shocks grew over time. (3) In response to the pandemic, almost a quarter of the firms reduced their prices with price reductions concentrated among businesses facing financial constraints and demand shocks; almost no firms raised prices. (4) Only a quarter of small businesses had access to formal sources of financing at the start of the pandemic, and access to formal financing affected how firms responded to the pandemic. (5) Increased household responsibilities affected the ability of managers and employees to focus on their work, whereas increased business responsibilities impacted their ability to take care of their household members. This effect persisted through December 2020 and was particularly strong for women and parents of school-aged children.

Increased household production increases the availability of own produced food for consumption, as well as income for food purchases. Increased knowledge of nutrition introduced through a behavior change communication strategy can change food preferences and shift purchasing decisions towards nutritious foods. In a randomized control trial, we demonstrate that an integrated agriculture‐nutrition program in Burkina Faso improved the quality of diets by reducing household macro and micronutrient consumption gaps. We estimate production and consumption nutrient gaps for households in our sample by comparing reported consumption or production of nutrients relative to recommended daily allowances for households. Differences between actual nutrient consumption and production values and the recommended daily allowances provide an estimate of the nutrient gaps (surplus or deficit) within the household. We find that the integrated agriculture‐nutrition program reduced consumption nutrient gaps in treatment households. We also investigate whether the production or nutrition knowledge pathways explain the consumption nutrient gap treatment effects. Though crop choice led to a diversified household production of nutritious foods in treatment villages on the extensive production margin, increased household production of nutrients does not explain the improvements in diet quality due to limited treatment effects for the estimated production nutrient gaps at the intensive production margin. Consumption expenditures in treatment villages did increase purchases of nutritious foods, suggesting that the behavior change communication strategy is effective at not only increasing nutrition knowledge, but also in affecting consumer preferences.",CrossRef,84.95575221238938,Goal 2,0.1155033248706399,True,food production; food reserves; food scarcity; inequalities in food access; nutrition targets; nutritional needs

The present work addresses whether morals are represented as fact-like or preference-like, using behavioral and neuroimaging methods, in combination with statistical techniques that can a) generalize beyond our sample stimuli, and b) test whether particular item features are associated with neural activity. Behaviorally, and contrary to prior work, morals were perceived as more preference-like than fact-like. Neurally, morals and preferences elicited common magnitudes and spatial patterns of activity, particularly within dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), a critical region for social cognition. This common DMPFC activity for morals and preferences was present across whole-brain conjunctions, and in individually localized functional regions of interest (targeting the Theory of Mind network). By contrast, morals and facts did not elicit any neural activity in common. Follow-up item analyses suggested that the activity elicited in common by morals and preferences was explained by their shared tendency to evoke representations of mental states.

The meaning of “woman” is modulated by adding social class as in “rich woman” or “poor woman.” How does such intersectionality operate at-scale in everyday language? Which intersections dominate (are most frequent)? What qualities (positivity, competence, warmth) are ascribed to each intersection? In this study, we make it possible to address such questions by developing a stepwise procedure, Flexible Intersectional Stereotype Extraction (FISE), applied to word embeddings (GloVe; BERT) trained on billions of words of English Internet text, revealing insights into intersectional stereotypes. First, applying FISE to occupation stereotypes across intersections of gender, race, and class showed alignment with ground-truth data on occupation demographics, providing initial validation. Second, applying FISE to trait adjectives showed strong androcentrism (Men) and ethnocentrism (White) in dominating everyday English language (e.g. White + Men are associated with 59% of traits; Black + Women with 5%). Associated traits also revealed intersectional differences: advantaged intersectional groups, especially intersections involving Rich, had more common, positive, warm, competent, and dominant trait associates. Together, the empirical insights from FISE illustrate its utility for transparently and efficiently quantifying intersectional stereotypes in existing large text corpora, with potential to expand intersectionality research across unprecedented time and place.

In particular, I explore how a baseline incentive effect is moderated by two features of professionals’ tasks and jurisdictions: jurisdictional dominance (i.e., how much the profession controls the provision of the task relative to other professions) and jurisdictional prominence (i.e., how commonly provided the task is within a profession relative to other tasks). Using data on thousands of physician tasks from Ontario, Canada, and a difference-in-differences empirical design, I find that professionals’ incentive responses are smaller when a profession has higher jurisdictional dominance over a task, but are larger when the task has higher jurisdictional prominence within the profession. This research contributes to the literature on professions and professionals in multiple ways. First, I introduce the concepts of jurisdictional dominance and jurisdictional prominence, distinguishing them from each other and from existing conceptions of professional control. Second, this study shows that financial incentives can be an effective tool for influencing professionals, but highlights that their efficacy is shaped by a task’s jurisdictional dominance and jurisdictional prominence. Finally, I show that these new conceptions of jurisdictional control influence professionals’ behaviors in meaningful ways and should therefore be considered in future studies of professions.",CrossRef,84.55284552845528,Goal 17,0.006579773717615326,False,

Despite this complementarity, there is a unique equilibrium. We identify types of improvements in attribution that strengthen deterrence—namely, improving attack detection independently of any effect on the identifiability of the attacker, reducing false alarms, or replacing misidentification with non-detection. However, we show that other improvements in attribution can backfire, weakening deterrence—these include detecting more attacks where the attacker is difficult to identify or pursuing too much certainty in attribution.

Using data from consumer arbitration cases in the securities industry over the past two decades, where we observe detailed information on case characteristics, the randomly generated list of potential arbitrators presented to both parties, the selected arbitrator, and case outcomes, we establish several motivating facts. These facts suggest that firms hold an informational advantage over consumers in selecting arbitrators, resulting in industry-friendly arbitration outcomes. We then develop and calibrate a quantitative model of arbitrator selection in which firms hold an informational advantage in selecting arbitrators. Arbitrators, who are compensated only if chosen, compete with each other to be selected. The model allows us to decompose the firms’ advantage into two components: the advantage of choosing pro-industry arbitrators from a given pool and the equilibrium pro-industry tilt in the arbitration pool that arises because of arbitrator competition. Selecting arbitrators without the input of firms and consumers would increase consumer awards by $60,000 on average relative to the current system. Forty percent of this effect arises because the pool of arbitrators skews pro-industry due to competition. Even an informed consumer cannot avoid this pro-industry equilibrium effect. Counterfactuals suggest that redesigning the arbitrator selection mechanism for the benefit of consumers hinges on whether consumers are informed. Policies intended to benefit consumers, such as increasing arbitrator compensation or giving parties more choice, would benefit informed consumers but hurt the uninformed.",CrossRef,83.87096774193549,Goal 1,0.01925268724785819,False,

Each request type is characterized by its reward, arrival probability, and resource consumption. An upper bound for the collected reward is given by a linear optimization problem with a random right-hand side. This type of problem, known as packing linear program (LP), is ubiquitous in resource allocation. We provide a detailed characterization of the parametric structure of this packing LP. Relying on this geometric understanding, we revisit and expand on BudgetRatio algorithms that achieve constant regret by resolving this same packing LP in each period and accepting requests scored as sufficiently valuable. We illustrate the benefits of the geometric view in proving that (i) BudgetRatio achieves constant regret relative to the offline (full information) upper bound in the presence of inventory that is (slowly) restocked, and (ii) within explicitly identifiable bounds, the algorithm’s regret is robust to misspecification of the model parameters. This gives bounds for the bandits version of the problem in which the parameters have to be learned. (iii) The algorithm has an equivalent formulation as a generalized bid-price algorithm in which the bid prices can be adaptively and efficiently computed. Our analysis focuses on the evolution of the remaining inventory—in turn of the LP that drives BudgetRatio—as a stochastic process.

The optimal replenishment policy is characterized by two period‐dependent base‐stock levels but determining their values is not trivial, especially for nonstationary and correlated demand. We propose the Lookahead Peak‐Shaving policy that anticipates and peak shaves orders from future peak‐demand periods to the current period, thereby matching capacity and demand. Peak shaving anticipates future order peaks and partially shifts them forward. This contrasts with conventional smoothing, which recovers the inventory deficit resulting from demand peaks by increasing later orders. Our contribution is threefold. First, we use a novel iterative approach to prove the robust optimality of the Lookahead Peak‐Shaving policy. Second, we provide explicit expressions of the period‐dependent base‐stock levels and analyze the amount of peak shaving. Finally, we demonstrate how our policy outperforms other heuristics in stochastic systems. Most cost savings occur when demand is nonstationary and negatively correlated, and base capacities fluctuate around the mean demand.

Eastwick; Jehan Sparks; Patricia Arriaga,2025,"Ideal partner preferences (i.e., ratings of the desirability of attributes like attractiveness or intelligence) are the source of numerous foundational findings in the interdisciplinary literature on human mating. Recently, research on the predictive validity of ideal partner preference-matching (i.e., do people positively evaluate partners who match versus mismatch their ideals?) has become mired in several problems. First, articles exhibit discrepant analytic and reporting practices. Second, different findings emerge across laboratories worldwide, perhaps because they sample different relationship contexts and/or populations. This registered report—partnered with the Psychological Science Accelerator—uses a highly powered design (N = 10,358) across 43 countries and 22 languages to estimate preference-matching effect sizes. The most rigorous tests revealed significant preference-matching effects in the whole sample and for partnered and single participants separately. The “corrected pattern metric” that collapses across 35 traits revealed a zero-order effect of β = .19 and an effect of β = .11 when included alongside a normative preference-matching metric. Specific traits in the “level metric” (interaction) tests revealed very small (average β = .04) effects. Effect sizes were similar for partnered participants who reported ideals before entering a relationship, and there was no consistent evidence that individual differences moderated any effects. Comparisons between stated and revealed preferences shed light on gender differences and similarities: For attractiveness, men’s and (especially) women’s stated preferences underestimated revealed preferences (i.e., they thought attractiveness was less important than it actually was). For earning potential, men’s stated preferences underestimated—and women’s stated preferences overestimated—revealed preferences. Implications for the literature on human mating are discussed.",CrossRef,81.92771084337349,Goal 5,0.04063819120514615,False,gender bias; gender-sensitive budgeting

Here, we introduce the Project Implicit:International (PI:International) dataset that has the potential to propel such research by offering the first cross-country dataset of both implicit (indirectly-measured) and explicit (directly-measured) attitudes and stereotypes across multiple topics and years. PI:International comprises 2.3 million tests for 7 topics (race, sexual orientation, age, body weight, nationality, and skin-tone attitudes, as well as men/women–science/arts stereotypes) using both indirect (Implicit Association Test; IAT) and direct (self-report) measures collected continuously from 2009 to 2019 from 34 countries in each country’s native language(s). We show that the IAT data from PI:International have adequate internal consistency (split-half reliability), convergent validity (implicit–explicit correlations), and known groups validity. Given such reliability and validity, we summarize basic descriptive statistics on the overall strength and variability of implicit and explicit attitudes and stereotypes around the world.

Two widely used approaches to address influential observations in accounting studies are winsorization and truncation. While expedient, both depend on researcher-selected cutoffs, applied on a variable-by-variable basis, which, unfortunately, can alter legitimate data points. We compare the efficacy of winsorization, truncation, influence diagnostics (Cook's Distance), and robust regression at identifying influential observations. Replication of three published accounting studies shows that the choice impacts estimates and inferences. Simulation evidence shows that winsorization and truncation are ineffective at identifying influential observations. While influence diagnostics and robust regression both outperform winsorization and truncation, overall, robust regression outperforms the other methods. Since robust regression is a theoretically appealing and easily implementable approach based on a model's residuals, we recommend that future accounting studies consider using robust regression, or at least report sensitivity tests using robust regression.

Thus, overvaluation at the time of the SEO is more likely when managers actively engage in more opaque channels to overstate earnings.

The results show the level of SG&A costs increases more with an increase in sales revenue (activity) while it decreases less with an equivalent reduction in sales revenue (activity). Also, this study finds that the frequency of audit committee meetings decreases the magnitude stickiness of SG&A costs, which supports the view that frequent meetings of AC significantly enhance its overseeing function and effectiveness.

While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human–machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.",CrossRef,81.0126582278481,Goal 9,0.04970978208671858,False,industrial resilience

(c) What tendencies do people bring to their relationships? (d) How does the context affect relationships? The 14 principles paint a cohesive and unified picture of romantic relationships that reflects a strong and maturing discipline. However, the principles afford few of the sorts of conflicting predictions that can be especially helpful in fostering novel theory development.

Part suppliers want to obsolete older generations of parts with declining demand and reassign resources to new, growing generations. Meanwhile, durable goods manufacturers that purchase and sell spare parts to customers want suppliers to keep producing old parts. When suppliers offer a “last time buy” opportunity for legacy parts in anticipation of their retirement, manufacturers push back. We study the strategic interaction and equilibria of a supplier and a manufacturer during the rollover between a legacy part and its successor in a durable good supply chain. Evidence from our interviews shows that manufacturers attempt to use the future business of the new part to delay a supplier’s last time buy of the old part. However, this tactic is often ineffective in practice. We propose a two-stage noncooperative game that reproduces the behaviors observed in interviews. Our analysis of this game distills the conditions under which a manufacturer can leverage the future business to delay a last time buy. There exist only six strategies that achieve this delay. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for these six strategies to be subgame perfect Nash equilibria. The condition reduces to a closed-form threshold on the new part volume.

Inequality scholars have long identified racial disparities in wage and occupational attainment, but workers’ careers and well-being are also shaped by elements of their work environment, including firm culture, managerial style, and work-life balance. I theorize two processes that could lead to racial inequality in firms’ work environments: (1) employee sorting due to exclusionary practices, and (2) spillover from racial differences in occupation and geographic location. To test this, I gathered a unique firm-level dataset composed of one million employee reviews, covering most large and medium-sized firms in the United States. I show that firms with more Black employees score lower for managerial quality, firm culture, and work-life balance, and firms with more Asian employees score higher on these dimensions. However, Asian employees’ advantage disappears when controlling for occupation, industry, and geography, whereas Black employees’ disadvantage persists, suggesting that the process of firm-level employee sorting is at work. Consistent with this, I find that Black employees’ disadvantage is strongest in areas with more conservative racial attitudes and more prevalent workplace racial discrimination. I then replicated the main findings using two entirely different data sources. Together, these results underscore racial inequality in work environments, an overlooked but important dimension of workplace inequality.",CrossRef,79.36507936507937,Goal 10,0.1055532511122525,True,ethnic inequality; racial inequality

We do so in the framework of multilevel Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function, where factors are disaggregated into skilled and unskilled labor, and capital into structures and equipment capital. Using a five-equation system approach and several nesting alternatives, we retrieve estimates of the substitution elasticities and technical changes. Our estimations can produce results in line with capital-skill-complementarity hypothesis.

Nonprofit provision of resources and services via schools is theoretically mutually beneficial, efficient, and effective. In practice, however, schools struggle to make the necessary investments to maintain relationships. Why? Through an inductive multimethods study of 81 nonprofit organizations and nine schools that partner with them, we find that schools struggle because it is difficult to effectively manage the temporal costs of the relationships. Principals, teachers, and staff have many demands on their time, and spending additional time coordinating and administrating nonprofit relationships is a challenge. Intersecting survey, interview, and archival data from schools and nonprofit organizations, we find the nine schools take on this operational challenge of managing temporal costs with one of two time logics, defined as a sociocultural belief about time resources at the school. The three charter schools in our study have a fixed logic that views time as a static resource, while the public and Catholic schools have an adaptable logic that views time as a flexible resource. We observe that these logics correspond to the school’s workforce operations, specifically whether or not they rely on external affiliates, such as district/community leaders or parents, to dedicate time to help manage school–nonprofit relationships. Schools with an adaptable-time logic have more time flexibility for managing nonprofit relationships when they rely on this external “workforce” compared to schools with a fixed-time logic that do not. The evidence suggests more generally how organizational culture and time logics relate to workforce operations. We conclude with preliminary evidence of long-term relationship outcomes from a follow-up survey of the same schools in our original study and discuss the implications for improving nonprofit provision of resources and services via schools.",CrossRef,79.01234567901234,Goal 4,0.01761746526160476,False,school infrastructure

A key contribution of this study is to utilize an agent-based model (ABM) that draws upon the research on leadership, networks, and innovation to specify generative mechanisms (or micro-processes) through which shared leadership structures emerge over space and time. The parameters in this model were estimated from empirical data. Results of virtual experiments (VE) yielded testable hypotheses suggesting that, over time, leadership capacity and between-team ties are negatively influenced by space.

We question the robustness of this assumption and identify scenarios in which sustainability is likely to have the opposite effect, strengthening rather than weakening consumers' product performance beliefs. Specifically, we argue that sustainability is likely to produce a halo effect able to attenuate and even override the negative impact of compensatory inferences underlying consumers' belief that sustainability comes at the expense of performance. We propose that this halo effect stems from consumers' view of the company as a moral agent engaged in a prosocial behavior. In this context, we identify two factors that are likely to influence the strength of the halo effect: the degree to which consumers view the company as a moral agent whose actions aim to benefit society and the degree to which moral concerns are prominent in consumers' minds. Following this line of reasoning, we identify two ways in which managers can increase the perceived performance of sustainable products: by associating sustainable benefits with the company rather than with its products and by emphasizing the societal benefits of sustainability. We test these predictions in a series of four empirical studies that show convergent evidence for our theorizing.

Drawing on ethnographic data from one hospital implementing a new behavioral control mechanism across multiple internal units, I explore how control mechanisms spread and unfold inside organizations. This study shows that control mechanisms are co-created through interactions between managers and employees as they engage in an iterative team learning process in two stages: (1) learning about the mandated control mechanism in order to assess its viability in their local context; and (2) learning how to (re)design the control mechanism so that it delivers its intended control outcomes. It also identifies two pathways through which control mechanisms unfold. Along the customization pathway, teams customize the mandated control mechanism so that it functions well in their context. Along the transmutation pathway, teams develop their own locally designed alternative control mechanism to achieve the intended control outcomes based on their own assessment of their unit’s problems. By showing how organizational control mechanisms are co-created by management and employees, this study provides a dynamic view of how control mechanisms spread and unfold within organizations.",CrossRef,87.3584905660377,Goal 4,0.01104143112034572,False,

This issue of the American Behavioral Scientist brings together scholarship examining the various ways in which many vulnerable populations are bearing a disproportionate share of the costs of COVID-19. As the articles bring to light, the unequal effects of the pandemic are reverberating along preexisting fault lines and creating new ones. In the economic realm, the rental market emerges during the pandemic as an economic arena of heightened socio-spatial and racial/ethnic disparities. Financial markets are another domain where market mechanisms mask the exploitative relationships between the economically vulnerable and powerful actors. Turning to gender inequalities, across national contexts, women represent an increasingly vulnerable segment of the labor market as the pandemic piles on new burdens of remote schooling and caregiving despite a variety of policy initiatives. Moving from the economic to the digital domain, we see how people with disabilities employ social media to mitigate increased vulnerability stemming from COVID-19. Finally, the key effects of digital vulnerability are heightened because the digitally disadvantaged experience not only informational inequalities but also aggravated bodily manifestations of stress or anxiety related to the pandemic. Each article contributes to our understanding of the larger mosaic of inequality that is being exacerbated by the pandemic.

We first explore the question of whether delay announcements impact customers’ behavior using a nonparametric approach. The answer to this question appears to be ambiguous. We thus turn to investigate the fundamental mechanism by which delay announcements impact customer behavior, by constructing a dynamic structural model. In contrast to the implicit assumption made in the literature that announcements do not directly impact customers’ waiting costs, our key insights show that delay announcements not only impact customers’ beliefs about the system but also directly impact customers’ waiting costs. In particular, customers’ per-unit waiting cost decreases with the offered waiting times associated with the announcements. The results of our counterfactual analysis show that it may not be necessary to provide announcements with very fine granularity.

Our framework is based on Bellman inequalities, which decompose the loss of an algorithm into two distinct sources of error: (1) arising from computational tractability issues, and (2) arising from estimation/prediction of random trajectories. Balancing these errors guides the choice of benchmarks, and leads to policies that are both tractable and have strong performance guarantees.

Zajac,2023,"The institutionalized status of markets is undoubtedly due to their presumed ability to aggregate individual bids into a single unbiased estimate of value. While not denying this emergent property of market processes, we propose and test an alternative perspective that explains how market processes can also generate the propagation of individual valuation errors that aggregate into price bubbles. Theoretically, we advance a microinstitutional perspective that draws from social and evolutionary psychology linking market processes to a more general process of institutionalization, whereby individuals seeking the adaptive benefits of conformity may—due to bounded and socially biased rationality—instead generate maladaptive individual and collective outcomes. Empirically, we craft an efficient experimental market and find three sets of evidence consistent with our microinstitutionalization perspective. We first show—at the individual level—that market participants exhibit a social bias toward conformity with the market’s collective valuation, even when the emergent market valuation is demonstrably incorrect. We then show—at the market level—that the range of valuations over time also decreases in a conforming direction, again independent of valuation accuracy. Last, we provide the first experimental test of the long-assumed effect of social ambiguity on institutionalization, finding that market participants’ over-attention to the collective valuation is indeed sensitive to variation in social ambiguity. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of our theoretical perspective, method, and findings for future research on institutions and institutionalization processes, as well as future studies on social influence and conformity-based errors.

We find that the installation of ESLs increased gross margins substantially, which implies profit gains that go far beyond labor cost savings. We also explore the mechanism behind this effect. We find that the lift in gross margins was associated with an increase in quantity sold and a decrease in price per unit sold, and that the lift primarily came from low-shelf life product categories. Moreover, we find that more and smaller price changes occurred with ESLs. These additional price changes were mostly price decreases, and they were dispersed in time.

We conducted initial field surveys across a spectrum of social movements, including Occupy Wall Street and #metoo, as well as those related to business sustainability and gun control, which showed that institutional insiders are often just as angry as outsider activists. But the evidence from those surveys did not show that social movement anger translated into collective action intentions among institutional insiders. We tested our theory deductively with an experiment conducted with participants who were supportive of social movement issues in their organizations. Overall, our results show that anger about a social movement issue relates to greater collective action intentions among outsider activists but not among institutional insiders. Instead of anger emboldening institutional insiders to act despite the potential costs, anger triggers fear about the potential negative consequences of collective action in the workplace, which in turn results in withdrawal. While social movements often rely on anger frames to mobilize sympathizers, our work suggests that this practice may paradoxically cause fear that immobilizes those uniquely positioned to be able to influence organizations to change.",CrossRef,86.92307692307692,Goal 1,0.02547875911776428,False,

As time passes, nodes can change their locations assuming new configurations, with different interaction patterns. The aim of this manuscript is to define a dynamic latent space relational event model. We then develop a computationally efficient method for inferring the locations of the nodes. We make use of the expectation maximization algorithm, which embeds an extension of the universal Kalman filter. Kalman filters are known for being effective tools in the context of tracking objects in the space, with successful applications in fields such as geolocalization. We extend its application to dynamic networks by filtering the signal from a sequence of adjacency matrices and recovering the hidden movements.

We theorize and test our perspective in the context of competitive bidding ceremonies using a unique, decade-long data set on repeated competitive market interactions among firms in the U.S. construction industry.

Experts process information more efficiently, remember information better, and often make better decisions. Consumers pursue expertise in domains they love and chase experiences that make them feel something. Yet, might becoming an expert carry a cost for these very feelings? Across more than 700,000 consumers and 6 million observations, developing expertise in a hedonic domain predicts consumers becoming more emotionally numb—that is, having less intense emotion in response to their experiences. This numbness occurs across a range of domains—movies, photography, wine, and beer—and across diverse measures of emotion and expertise. It occurs in cross-sectional real-world data with certified experts, and in longitudinal real-world data that follows consumers over time and traces their emotional trajectories as they accrue expertise. Furthermore, this numbness can be explained by the cognitive structure experts develop and apply within a domain. Experimentally inducing cognitive structure led novice consumers to experience greater numbness. However, shifting experts away from using their cognitive structure restored their experience of emotion. Thus, although consumers actively pursue expertise in domains that bring them pleasure, the present work is the first to show that this pursuit can come with a hedonic cost.",CrossRef,86.19047619047619,Goal 17,0.01064517340947544,False,

We investigated whether, why, and when the mere physical presence of others affects risk‐taking behaviors in three contexts: acceptance of greater financial volatility, attitudes toward risky gambles, and actual gambling behaviors. Results indicate that people in the mere physical presence of others make riskier decisions than people making identical decisions alone, and that feelings of security were the psychological mechanism behind this effect. Our results also suggest that the effect is contingent on whether people are surrounded by others who belong to the same social group.

Yet, in the current U.S. pricing system, the price of the drug is the same regardless of the indication for which it is prescribed. This uniform pricing policy can deter the payer from providing coverage for low-value indications, if the price is high relative to the potential benefit for patients, which can reduce patients’ access to the drug. It can also deter the drug manufacturer from investing in obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for new indications, as the lack of flexibility in pricing can result in too low demand (and thus profits) to recoup fixed investment costs. Indication-based pricing has been proposed as a new pricing mechanism for multi-indication drugs allowing the price to differ according to the indication, to better align the price of the drug to its value. In this paper, we analyze the effect of indication-based pricing in comparison with uniform pricing on the drug manufacturer’s profit and investment incentives, the patient demand and utility, the payer’s coverage incentives, and the payer’s objective. Under uniform pricing, we consider both the cases when the price can versus cannot be adjusted upon introduction of a new indication. We find that the drug manufacturer earns higher profits under indication-based pricing than under uniform pricing. Moreover, indication-based pricing improves incentives for the manufacturer to invest in a new indication and for the payer to cover the drug. If the fixed investment cost is high, indication-based pricing also benefits patients and the payer’s objective. Otherwise, the patient demand, patient utility and payer’s objective may be lower under indication-based pricing. Hence, payers who value the patient utility should carefully consider the tradeoffs involved in implementing this pricing system and where the bottlenecks are under uniform pricing.

Gino,2020,"How individuals manage, organize, and complete their tasks is central to operations management. Recent research in operations focuses on how under conditions of increasing workload individuals can decrease their service time, up to a point, to complete work more quickly. As the number of tasks increases, however, workers may also manage their workload by a different process—task selection. Drawing on research on workload, individual discretion, and behavioral decision making, we theorize and then test that under conditions of increased workload, individuals may choose to complete easier tasks to manage their load. We label this behavior task completion preference (TCP). Using six years of data from a hospital emergency department, we find that physicians engage in TCP, with implications for their performance. Specifically, TCP helps physicians manage variance in service times; however, although it initially appears to improve shift-level throughput volume, after adjusting for the complexity of the work completed, TCP is related to worse throughput. Moreover, we find that engaging in easier tasks compared with hard ones is related to lower learning in service times. We then turn to the laboratory to replicate conceptually the short-term task selection effect under increased workload and show that it occurs because of both fatigue and the sense of progress individuals get from task completion. These findings provide another mechanism for the workload-speedup effect from the literature.

The stationary distributions of the approximations are used as proxies for those of the queues. The convergence of suitably scaled and centered processes provides mathematical support for the use of these Brownian models. As with the central limit theorem, to establish convergence, one must impose assumptions directly on the primitives or indirectly on the parameters of a related optimization problem. These assumptions reflect an interpretation of the underlying parameters—a classification into so-called heavy-traffic regimes that specify a scaling relationship between the utilization and the arrival rate. Here, it matters whether a utilization of 90% in a queue with an arrival rate of λ = 100 is read as [Formula: see text] or as ρ(λ) ≡ 0.9, because different interpretations lead to different limits and, in turn, to different approximations. However, from a heuristic point of view, there is an immediate Brownian (i.e., normal) analogue of the queueing model that is derived directly from the primitives and requires no scaling interpretation of the parameters. In this model, the drift is that of the original queue, and the noise term is replaced by a Brownian motion with the same variance. This is intuitive and appealing as a tool, but it lacks mathematical justification. In this paper, we prove that for the fundamental M/GI/1 + GI queue, this direct intuitive approach works: the Brownian model is accurate uniformly over a family of patience distributions and universally in the heavy-traffic regime. The validity of this approach extends to dynamic control in that the solution of the directly derived diffusion control problem is universally accurate. To build mathematical support for the accuracy of this model, we introduce a framework built around “queue families” that allows us to treat various patience distributions simultaneously, and it uncovers the role of a concentration property of the queue.

Wu,2023,"Problem definition: We study scheduling multi-class impatient customers in parallel server queueing systems. At the time of arrival, customers are identified as being one of many classes, and the class represents the service and patience time distributions as well as cost characteristics. From the system’s perspective, customers of the same class at time of arrival get differentiated on their residual patience time as they wait in queue. We leverage this property and propose two novel and easy-to-implement multi-class scheduling policies. Academic/practical relevance: Scheduling multi-class impatient customers is an important and challenging topic, especially when customers’ patience times are nonexponential. In these contexts, even for customers of the same class, processing them under the first-come, first-served (FCFS) policy is suboptimal. This is because, at time of arrival, the system only knows the overall patience distribution from which a customer’s patience value is drawn, and as time elapses, the estimate of the customer’s residual patience time can be further updated. For nonexponential patience distributions, such an update indeed reveals additional information, and using this information to implement within-class prioritization can lead to additional benefits relative to the FCFS policy. Methodology: We use fluid approximations to analyze the multi-class scheduling problem with ideas borrowed from convex optimization. These approximations are known to perform well for large systems, and we use simulations to validate our proposed policies for small systems. Results: We propose a multi-class time-in-queue policy that prioritizes both across customer classes and within each class using a simple rule and further show that most of the gains of such a policy can be achieved by deviating from within-class FCFS for at most one customer class. In addition, for systems with exponential patience times, our policy reduces to a simple priority-based policy, which we prove is asymptotically optimal for Markovian systems with an optimality gap that does not grow with system scale. Managerial implications: Our work provides managers ways of improving quality of service to manage parallel server queueing systems. We propose easy-to-implement policies that perform well relative to reasonable benchmarks. Our work also adds to the academic literature on multi-class queueing systems by demonstrating the joint benefits of cross- and within-class prioritization. Funding: A.

We consider two problem formulations. The first formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that its expected performance exceeds a predefined threshold. The second formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that it outperforms a baseline in an out-of-sample statistical test. We establish theoretical properties of these problems, based on which we propose computationally efficient algorithms for optimal sample size calculations. We illustrate our algorithms and analysis using data from a luxury fashion retailer. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.

While this effort has documented and explored a long list of on-farm market constraints, the role of agrodealers in agricultural input markets has received far less attention—a critical blind spot. We review the empirical literature on input markets in low-income countries with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that the relative sparsity of this literature reflects limitations in our workhorse models of the household and the firm combined with a supply-side data gap due to infrequent systematic surveys of agrodealer firms. Consequently, we understand too little about the diverse input supply chains that culminate with agrodealers—large and small—marketing key inputs to farmers.

Significant effort is required to perform data analytics on experimental outputs and for computational modeling of custom experiments. Moreover, experiments and modeling are often performed in a cycle, enabling iterative experimental refinement and data modeling to uncover interesting insights and to generate/refute hypotheses about social behaviors. The current practice for social analysts is to develop tailor-made computer programs and analytical scripts for experiments and modeling. This often leads to inefficiencies and duplication of effort. In this work, we propose a pipeline framework to take a significant step towards overcoming these challenges. Our contribution is to describe the design and implementation of a software system to automate many of the steps involved in analyzing social science experimental data, building models to capture the behavior of human subjects, and providing data to test hypotheses. The proposed pipeline framework consists of formal models, formal algorithms, and theoretical models as the basis for the design and implementation. We propose a formal data model, such that if an experiment can be described in terms of this model, then our pipeline software can be used to analyze data efficiently.

We find support for the model's predictions using a unique data set detailing search behavior of mortgage borrowers. Estimating the model, we find that screening is informative and search is costly.

We investigate these questions across three studies and eight independent samples (Total N = 7,460 analyzed responses) in the context of Black-White relations in the United States. Specifically, we examine White Americans’ meta-beliefs about whether Black Americans desire power to structure society into a hierarchy in which they are dominant versus to institute equality for all groups (i.e., meta-dominance beliefs). Across 6 cross-sectional sub-samples (Study 1, Samples A-F; N = 3,383), we developed and validated a measure of meta-dominance, and found that White Americans varied substantially in their beliefs about how Black Americans would use power.

Using data on nearly 5 million births performed by more than 16,500 physicians across 915 hospitals in Brazil, we find that working alongside peers whose practice style (enduring preference) favors C-sections leads the focal physician to perform more C-sections, even after controlling for features of the mother and the pregnancy. This influence is significantly stronger for physicians with higher task variety and with higher task similarity with peers. Through post-hoc analyses, we provide evidence that the observed behaviors are consistent with a mechanism of information sharing between physicians.

Thomas; T. Mellewigt; Ingo Weller; Edward J. Zajac,2017,"Research summary : While alliance researchers view prior partner‐specific alliance experience as influencing firms' subsequent alliance or acquisition decisions, empirical evidence on the alliance versus acquisition decision is surprisingly mixed. We offer a reconciliation by proposing and testing an analytical framework that recognizes prior partner‐specific experiences as heterogeneous along three fundamental dimensions: partner‐specific trust, routines, and value certainty. This allows us to use a policy‐capturing methodology to rigorously operationalize and test our mechanism‐level predictions. We find that all three mechanisms can increase the likelihood of a subsequent alliance or acquisition, and in terms of the comparative choice between alliances versus acquisitions, partner‐specific trust pulls towards alliances, and value certainty pulls towards acquisitions. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and empirical implications of our approach and method . Managerial summary : This study focuses on an important corporate decision: When a firm has had an alliance with another firm, how would that experience affect the likelihood of a future alliance or acquisition with that same firm? We first suggest that it will depend on three factors: the level of trust that existed in that prior alliance, the extent to which specific work routines were developed, and the degree to which the firm was able to confidently assess the value of the partner firm's resources. We then find that trust is a particularly strong predictor of future alliances, while confidence regarding value more strongly predicts future acquisitions.

The evidence implies that politicians are more inclined to take actions benefiting special interests when the public is distracted.

In “A Low-rank Approximation for MDPs via Moment Coupling,” Zhang and Gurvich introduce a novel framework to approximate Markov decision processes (MDPs) that stands on two pillars: (i) state aggregation, as the algorithmic infrastructure, and (ii) central-limit-theorem-type approximations, as the mathematical underpinning. The theoretical guarantees are grounded in the approximation of the Bellman equation by a partial differential equation (PDE) where, in the spirit of the central limit theorem, the transition matrix of the controlled Markov chain is reduced to its local first and second moments. Instead of solving the PDE, the algorithm introduced in the paper constructs a “sister”' (controlled) Markov chain whose two local transition moments are approximately identical with those of the focal chain. Because of this moment matching, the original chain and its sister are coupled through the PDE, facilitating optimality guarantees. Embedded into standard soft aggregation, moment matching provides a disciplined mechanism to tune the aggregation and disaggregation probabilities.",CrossRef,78.57142857142857,Goal 9,0.03053217275074242,False,

We tackle the problem of estimating the wait time of an allocatee who possesses incomplete system information with regard, for example, to his relative priority, other allocatees’ preferences, and resource availability. We model such systems as multiclass, multiserver queuing systems that are potentially unstable or in transient regime. We propose a novel robust optimization solution methodology that builds on the assignment problem. For first-come, first-served systems, our approach yields a mixed-integer programming formulation. For the important case where there is a hierarchy in the resource types, we strengthen our formulation through a drastic variable reduction and also propose a highly scalable heuristic, involving only the solution of a convex optimization problem (usually a second-order cone problem). We back the heuristic with an approximation guarantee that becomes tighter for larger problem sizes. We illustrate the generalizability of our approach by studying systems that operate under different priority rules, such as class priority. Numerical studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms simulation. We showcase how our methodology can be applied to assist patients in the U.S. deceased-donor kidney waitlist.

Importantly, consumers can perceive the exact same perk as more versus less contractual depending on the way it is conferred, structured, or framed. This research demonstrates that low-contractuality perks can be more effective than high-contractuality perks at fostering WOM in the absence of explicit incentives to do so. In particular, low-contractuality perks are more likely than high-contractuality perks to convey a relational signal that motivates consumers to help the company by sharing WOM. Seven experiments, two of which were conducted in the field, support this hypothesis and illustrate conditions under which the effect attenuates or reverses. On the whole, this work offers insights into how managers might design interventions that foster WOM, and it reveals potential trade-offs of commonly used high-contractuality perks.",CrossRef,87.6923076923077,Goal 17,0.006844163452391042,False,

We show that dynamic pricing generates higher retailer profits, a lower average price per unit sold, and higher sales volumes than static pricing. The mechanism behind the result is that with dynamic pricing the retailer ties the price of each unit to its holding costs, which allows him to increase the order quantity compared with static pricing and thus save on fixed ordering costs. Some of these cost savings are passed to consumers. Moreover, we demonstrate that this mechanism is robust to the presence of price-anticipating (strategic) consumer behavior.

Starting from linguistic expertise and ending with methodological recommendations for the development of texts of draft laws. The issue of recognizing judicial precedent as a source of Russian law is relevant. At the heart of the legal linguistic context, judicial discretion and judicial precedent are concepts that require analysis. The paper discusses the concepts of judicial discretion and judicial precedent. Their specifics and characteristic features are defined, and the place of judicial precedent in the system of Russian law is highlighted. The role of the decisions of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the differences between the plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and the judicial precedent are analyzed. The study highlighted the distinctive features that distinguished judicial discretion from other types of law enforcement discretion. Methods: the methodological framework is based on the methods of historicism, systematicity, and comparative law. Results: the author’s position justified in the work is based on knowledge in the criminal process. Conclusions: as a result of the study, it is revealed that the study of the discretion of the court includes an analysis of the relationship with judicial precedent. It is one of the sources of law, so its analysis and mutual influence on judicial discretion seem to be important aspects. It is established that the judicial precedent is a decision of the higher courts.

Van Mieghem; Hossein Mehrizi,2023,"Problem definition: Patient-level data from 72 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hospitals in Ontario, Canada from 2013 to 2017 show that over 60% of patients exceeded their wait time targets. We conduct a data-driven analysis to quantify the reduction in the patient fraction exceeding (FET) target for MRI services through geographic virtual resource-sharing while limiting incremental driving time. We present a data-driven method to solve the geographic pooling problem of partitioning 72 hospitals with heterogeneous patients with different wait time targets located in a two-dimensional region into a set of clusters. Methodology/results: We propose an “augmented-priority rule,” which is a sequencing rule that balances the patient’s initial priority class and the number of days until her wait time target. We then use neural networks to predict patient arrival and service times. We combine this predicted information and the sequencing rule to implement “advance scheduling,” which informs the patient of her treatment day and location when requesting an MRI scan. We then optimize the number of geographic resource pools among the 72 hospitals using genetic algorithms. Our resource-pooling model lowers the FET from 66% to 36% while constraining the average incremental travel time below three hours. In addition, our model shows that only 10 additional scanners are needed to achieve 10% FET, whereas 50 additional scanners would be needed without resource sharing. Over 70% of the hospitals are not worse off financially. Each individual hospital, measured over at least two weeks, achieves a higher machine utilization and a lower FET. Managerial implications: Our paper provides a practical, data-driven geographical resource-sharing model that hospitals can readily implement. Our method achieves a near-optimal solution with low computational complexity. Using smart data-driven scheduling, a little extra capacity placed at the right location is all we need to achieve the desired FET under geographic resource-sharing.

More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a company’s prosocial actions are strong enough to alter the product evaluations even when consumers can directly observe and experience the product. The data further show that this effect is a function of the moral undertone of the company’s motivation for engaging in socially responsible behavior and is attenuated when consumers believe that the company’s behavior is driven by self-interest rather than by benevolence.

The average power of a set of prior studies is a quantity that has attracted considerable attention for this purpose, and techniques to estimate this quantity via a meta-analytic approach have recently been proposed. In this article, we have two aims. First, we clarify the nature of average power and its implications for replicability. We explain that average power is not relevant to the replicability of actual prospective replication studies. Instead, it relates to efforts in the history of science to catalogue the power of prior studies. Second, we evaluate the statistical properties of point estimates and interval estimates of average power obtained via the meta-analytic approach. We find that point estimates of average power are too variable and inaccurate for use in application. We also find that the width of interval estimates of average power depends on the corresponding point estimates; consequently, the width of an interval estimate of average power cannot serve as an independent measure of the precision of the point estimate.

We argue that features of the production process that are commonly encountered in practice (including differential production technologies and financial constraints) may result in the formation of inefficient supply chains, owing to the misalignment of the sourcing incentives of firms at different tiers. We provide a characterization of the conditions under which upstream suppliers adopt sourcing strategies that are suboptimal from the perspective of firms further downstream. Our analysis highlights that a focus on optimizing procurement decisions in each tier of the supply chain in isolation may not be sufficient for mitigating risks at an aggregate level. Rather, we argue that a holistic view of the entire supply network is necessary to properly assess and secure against disruptive events. Importantly, the misalignment we identify does not originate from cost or reliability asymmetries. Rather, firms’ sourcing decisions are driven by the interplay of the firms’ risk considerations with nonconvexities in the production process.

We examine how inspector schedules could introduce bias that erodes inspection quality by altering inspector stringency. Our analysis of thousands of food-safety inspections reveals that inspectors are affected by the inspection outcomes at their prior-inspected establishment (outcome effects), citing more violations after they inspect establishments that exhibited worse compliance levels or trends. Moreover, consistent with negativity bias, the effect is stronger after observing compliance deterioration than improvement. Inspection results are also affected by when the inspection occurs within an inspector’s day (daily schedule effects): Inspectors cite fewer violations after spending more time conducting inspections throughout the day and when inspections risk prolonging their typical workday. Overall, our findings suggest that currently unreported violations would be cited if the outcome effects—which increase scrutiny—were triggered more often and if the daily schedule effects—which erode scrutiny—were reduced. For example, our estimates indicate that if outcome effects were doubled and daily schedule effects were fully mitigated, 11% more violations would be detected, enabling remedial actions that could substantially reduce foodborne illnesses and hospitalizations.

Results reveal that time spent online and the network pressure toward balance (individuals tending to form relationships with others who have relationships in common) predict the emergence of online relationship ties, while gender, age, proximity, homophily (the tendency of individuals to form relationships among people with similar traits), and preferential attachment are not significant predictors within the observed networks.

This is done by proposing a framework that consists of three techniques, each of which combines the components of CEV to make it more comprehensive and applicable. The paper also reviews and analyzes the work that has been done so far in the area of CEV whether in business to business (B2B), business to consumer (B2C) or consumer to consumer (C2C) markets. Design/methodology/approach CEV is a comprehensive term that measures the total value of the customer through capturing his transactional and non-transactional behaviors. Hence, it is an essential term for measuring the value of the customer in direct marketing. This motivates researchers to compete in developing models to maximize CEV. Meanwhile, most of the existing models are conceptual and the majority of them lack applicability due to many reasons. First, these models relied on a linear version of the CEV model, hence double-counting the value of the customer; also they weighted the components of CEV equally, which is unrealistic. Finally, the effect of the environmental components in determining the engagement level of each customer was almost ignored. In this paper, two main contributions are presented. First, a summary and analysis of the contributions of the literature in the CEV field for different market types whether in B2C, B2B or C2C. Furthermore, three modifications are added to the existing models. The first model introduces a non-linear relationship of the components of CEV. The second model is a weighted linear model of these components. Finally, the third model adds the environmental factors to the CEV components. All the proposed models are theoretical in nature, however, these models are expected to show superiority when being applied to real data sets due to their ability to capture the complexity in the relationship between the firm and its customers in real-life situations. The proposed models are expected to attract the practitioners and other researchers and they both are encouraged to apply the proposed models on real-life data sets, test their performance, compare them against each other, to be able to apply each of them on the best suitable data set and business scenario. Findings Based on the review and analysis that has been done on about 87 papers, it is found that the majority of the contributions that have been done in the area of CEV are theoretical in nature, in spite of the effectiveness of CEV in empowering business decision. It is also found that few researchers proposed a set of theoretical comprehensive frameworks that combined CEV’s components together. Meanwhile, those frameworks are not practically applicable. Research limitations/implications Although the contribution of the proposed models expected to attract both researchers and practitioners, these are not applied to real-life case studies to prove their effectiveness. Practical implications The research in this paper has many industrial and managerial implications. First, it helps managers and decision takers to treat the customers as assets and cost-free resources who can work with the firm to achieve what’s both aims to (i.e. increase customer satisfaction and firm’s profitability). Second, it helps the firm to determine the total value of each customer and treat its customers accordingly. Third, it empowers the managers to do target marketing, based on grouping the customers upon their total engagement. This would save time and cost and for sure increase the profitability and customer satisfaction. Forth, the proposed models take into consideration not only the transactional behavior of the customers but also the non-transactional factors that play a significant role in formulating the relationship between the firm and its customers.

Zajac,2024,"Prior research on the internationalization of firms from emerging countries has fruitfully invoked institutional theory to emphasize the legitimacy benefits that firms that obtain from showing isomorphism with international norms such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Without denying the intuitive appeal for these firms to communicate acceptance of CSR, we suggest that firms face a legitimacy trade‐off, where the hoped‐for legitimacy benefits of isomorphism must be weighed against other home‐country institutional considerations. We advance and test this notion that firms will navigate this institutional complexity by engaging in anisomorphism , i.e., espousing general acceptance with international values but with selective ‘translation’ based on home country differences. We test our predictions by analysing firms' communication of CSR, using a unique dataset comprised of 245 firms observed over the period from 2000 to 2018. Consistent with our predictions, we find that firms from countries more reliant on natural resource extraction (e.g., mining and fossil fuel industries) de‐emphasize the environmental component of CSR, and firms from more autocratic countries de‐emphasize the human rights component of CSR. Additionally, and consistent with our presumption of firms' weighing the international versus home‐country legitimacy trade‐off, we find that these main effects are sensitive to changes in firms' levels of internationalization.",CrossRef,82.65060240963855,Goal 17,0.03722118065612464,False,

Of the five values and norms measured, only norms for information sharing in negotiation were directly related to joint gains.

Cultures that maximized joint gains used direct information-sharing strategies or a combination of indirect and direct strategies. Power strategies may help or hurt joint gains, depending on a culture's values and norms for power and whether or not power-based influence is used in conjunction with sufficient information exchange.

We posit that in such complex political situations, firms will turn to a more subtle form of CPB (i.e., rhetorical commitment versus avoidance) as a hoped‐for solution to their international political legitimacy challenge. Our contingency perspective also highlights how geopolitical factors (i.e., whether governments of home and host countries are clearly aligned versus misaligned) will influence whether firms express their support for a home government’s foreign policy or avoid any such expression of support.

The results are reversed if the dominant firm is initially endowed with relatively few permits.

Is outsourcing another ephemeral management fad, or is it an efficient and effective means of delivering services and of adding value? What are the characteristics of strategically sound contracting decisions? And how can organizations prosper from the outsourcing revolution? The book is based on over a decade of research and consulting experience, and its conclusions have many practical implications. It develops an analytical decision‐making framework for the assessment of contracting options, and has relevance in both the private and public sectors. It contains many illustrations and over 30 international case studies; over 50 companies and public sector organizations are discussed, including Microsoft, BP, Marks & Spencer and Samsung. The book is divided into four parts. Part I begins by considering the ‘make or buy’ decision, and this is followed by a discussion of the shifting boundaries of organizations, which revisits some of the critical issues underlying the theory of the firm. Part II examines in detail the benefits and costs of contracting. Part III examines the strategic aspects of contracting, involving the implementation of actual policies. Part IV looks at structural change associated with contracting, at the level of both individual sectors and the whole economy.

The author assumes that because cultures differ in terms of functional solutions to problems of social interaction that there will be conflict when people from different cultures are interdependent in the workplace. The author discusses types of culture and their conflict management profiles with respect to three characteristics of conflict management: direct vs indirect confrontation; emotional expression, and third party conflict management. The author proposes what happens when cultures collide and calls for research on those collisions. Design/methodology/approach Application of the cultural literature on self-worth to three elements of workplace conflict: direct vs indirect confrontation of conflict, feelings and expressions of negative emotions associated with conflict and timing and type of third party intervention. Findings When people from dignity, face, and honor cultures are working together the fundamental differences in the logic of self-worth in these three types of culture may cause conflict. People from dignity and honor cultures are likely to confront conflict directly, while those from face cultures are more likely to confront conflict indirectly. Workplace conflict generates negative emotions, but culture seems to affect whether that emotion is anger, shame or both. The timing of third party intervention into workplace conflict, that is, how managers intervene in workplace conflict has some parallels with how community mediators act in that culture. Research limitations/implications There is limited research comparing management of workplace conflict in dignity, face, and honor cultures. The author generates propositions and suggests a research strategy for collecting data to test propositions. Practical implications Understanding what is culturally normative in terms of self-worth, confrontation, emotional expression, and managerial intervention can help people involved in workplace conflict understand what they are experiencing. It can also help managers intervene effectively. Social implications How people react to workplace conflict varies with culture as does how managers intervene. Knowing this provides people with the first element of cultural intelligence that may help them manage conflict to facilitate a more creative and effective multicultural work environment.

Since the 1990s, nine states have banned affirmative action practice in public universities and state governments. I theorize that although these bans have no legal jurisdiction over private-sector firms, they could influence such firms normatively. After such a ban, executives who have been skeptical of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policies may feel more normative license to reduce commitment to EEO practices. Using a difference-in-differences estimation on 11,311 firms from 1985 to 2015, I find that the bans are indeed associated with slower racial progress in private-sector firms: after a state adopts the affirmative action ban, growth in the proportion of Black managers in establishments with corporate headquarters in that state slows by more than 50 percent, and this slowdown is mostly concentrated in firms with politically conservative CEOs.

Existing alliance classification schemes based on type of collaborative activity, partner characteristics, or legal structure, on the other hand, rarely delineate important differences of how collaborative work is organized among partners. We seek to redress this shortcoming by developing a framework of alliance structural parameters based on classic organizational design considerations. Specifically we identify and discuss five key design parameters for alliances: the structural interface between partners, the structural “intraface” within partners, and the specialization, formalization, and centralization of the alliance organization.

Specifically, we propose a multifaceted perspective on exploitation by theoretically and empirically distinguishing between repetitive exploitation versus incremental exploitation. We argue that repetitive exploitation can impede exploration and delay firms' responses to environmental changes, while incremental exploitation can impel exploration and accelerate firms' responses to environmental changes. We test our arguments using extensive longitudinal data from the hard disk drive ( HDD ) industry, and our supportive empirical findings highlight the relevance of our distinction between the two types of exploitation and their very different effects on exploration . Managerial summary : This study offers a solution to the puzzle of why many believe firms cannot excel at advancing existing practices and developing new initiatives, typically described as the trade‐off between exploitation and exploration. We introduce the distinction between repetitive and incremental exploitation and show that only the former type of innovation generates rigidity toward exploration, whereas the latter actually promotes exploration. More specifically, our evidence from the hard disk drive industry shows that those firms emphasizing incremental innovation (as opposed to repetition of their existing practices) were most likely to remain explorative over time, whereas firms emphasizing more repetitive innovation proved less open to changes. We discuss the implications of our findings as suggesting that firms seeking to optimize their innovativeness over the long term should strive to remain active in incrementally innovating their existing practices .

According to the symmetric information theory, certification theory and enterprise property rights theory, the first round of risk financing enterprises from 2010 to 2019 is taken as a research sample to empirically analyze the impact of venture capital and corporate growth on firm listing events. The results show that the investment experience of venture capital institutions, when matched appropriately to firms’ specific growth, will facilitate and accelerate the IPO process. Thus the matching degree between the two are significantly positively related to the company's IPO. Under the premise of low growth of the company, venture capital has a significant impact on the listing of the company. As the growth of the company increases, the impact of venture capital on the listing of the company is gradually reduced.

Specifically, competition is pervasive to the extent that people achieve consensus about who possesses desirable qualities (e.g., attractiveness) and who does not. Because consensus is stronger earlier in the acquaintance process, assortative mating based on attractiveness should be stronger among couples who formed a relationship after a short period rather than a long period of acquaintance. A study of 167 couples included measures of how long partners had known each other before dating and whether they had been friends before dating, as well as coders’ ratings of physical attractiveness. As predicted, couples revealed stronger evidence of assortative mating to the extent that they knew each other for a short time and were not friends before initiating a romantic relationship.",CrossRef,84.36893203883494,Goal 17,0.003304291342726962,False,

At the same time, however, such preplay communication has been suggested as a rationale for expecting Nash equilibria in general. This paper presents a plausible formal model of cheap talk that distinguishes and resolves these possibilities. Players are assumed to have an unlimited opportunity to send messages before playing an arbitrary game. Using an extension of fictitious play beliefs, minimal assumptions are made concerning which messages about future actions are credible and hence contribute to final beliefs. In this environment, it is shown that meaningful communication among players leads to a Nash equilibrium (NE) of the action game. Within the set of NE, efficiency then turns out to be a consequence of imposing optimality on the cheap talk portion of the extended game.

Our contribution in this endeavor is twofold. Firstly, we distinguish between fear-based silence and sacred silence. Fear-based silence can be a running away from discomfort, a covering up of trepidation and anxiety. It can lead to collective amnesia and willful ignorance, a hoarding of status, privilege, and power, and forge deep divides between people. This is the world of masks and performativity, and at its worst harbors prejudice, hate, and destruction. Leadership tolerant of fear-based silence permits a festering of racism. Sacred silence by contrast heals and raises consciousness. For the kind of leadership required to consistently and indefatigably push for change and disruption to racism, we need a practice of sacred silence. Sacred silence cultivates the courage to look fearlessly within personal shadows and bravely at what is required to make the world a safe, secure, and just place for all.

Implicitly, there is a connection between these states and the underlying procession of events. The manner in which interactions follow one another over time describe a group's behavior, with different temporal patterns being indicative of different team characteristics. In this study, we explicitly connect event sequences to the process of emergence. We argue that the temporal relationship between events in a sequence will vary depending on the team's psychological outcome. Further, certain patterns of behavior will be repeated at different rates in teams with varying emergent states. To support this approach, we apply a statistical methodology—relational event modeling—for analyzing sequences of interactions that builds on the foundation of social network analysis. Using a dataset comprised of 55 work teams of military personnel engaged in a tactical scenario, we found that individuals who perceived team process (regarding coordination and information sharing) as having different qualities engaged in significantly different patterns of behavior.

The merger does align the objectives of CVS Health and Aetna with increasing patient health, most notably in creating incentives to reach Aetna customers before their health necessitates a visit to the hospital or another high cost site of care. However, the increased concentration in the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) industry and the anticompetitive effects of vertical integration in the health care industry could wipe out any cost savings for Aetna customers, and could even increase health care spending for consumers as a whole.

Recent work suggested that patients experiencing right lower abdominal pain, with normal white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are unlikely to have acute appendicitis and can be discharged. We present two independent datasets that suggest that this strategy may not be risk-free. Design Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients from two district general hospitals. Sensitivity and specificity of CRP, WCC and neutrophil count (NC) in predicting appendicitis were calculated. Markers were analysed using Fisher's exact test and Kruskul-Wallace test.

Moreover, the formal description, visualization, and analysis of these processes are nontrivial challenges. The purpose of this paper is to establish the term network nursing as synonym for using quantitative graph theory in nursing science and to discuss how network nursing can be used for tackling such complex challenges in nursing science. Methods In particular, methods from quantitative graph theory, divided into two major classes, comparative network analysis and network characterization, are employed to solve challenging problems in nursing. Findings We demonstrate by way of example that this mathematical apparatus is feasible to tackle research questions when modeling and analyzing nursing processes.

Conclusions Nursing networks can be used to characterize patients from a nursing perspective. Especially, they allow a process‐based view and are able to map relationships or dependencies.

Shapiro,2020,"When a subjective experience of difficulty is associated with a mental task, people tend to engage in systematic and deliberative reasoning, which can reduce the usage of intuitive and effortless thinking that gives rise to cognitive biases. One such bias is the illusion of causality, where people perceive a causal link between two unrelated events. In 2019, Díaz-Lago and Matute found that a superficial perceptual feature of the task could modulate the magnitude of the illusion (i.e., a hard-to-read font led to a decrease in the magnitude of the illusion). The present study explored the generalisability of the idea that perceptual disfluency can lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the illusion. In the first experiment, we tested whether a physical-perceptual manipulation of the stimuli, specifically the contrast between the written text and the background, could modulate the illusion in a contingency learning task. The results of the online experiment ( N = 200) showed no effect of contrast on the magnitude of the illusion, despite our manipulation having successfully induced task fluency or disfluency. Building upon this null result, our second experiment ( N = 100) focused on manipulating the font type, in an attempt to replicate the results obtained by Díaz-Lago and Matute. In contrast to their findings, we found no discernible effect of font type on the magnitude of the illusion, even though this manipulation also effectively induced variations in task fluency or disfluency. These results underscore the notion that not all categories of (dis)fluency in cognitive processing wield a modulatory influence on cognitive biases, and they call for a re-evaluation and a more precise delineation of the (dis)fluency construct.",CrossRef,81.85185185185185,Goal 16,0.003406568506228167,False,

The concept of UGC emerged prominently in the 21st century with the development and expansion of Web 2.0 technology. Web 2.0 is distinguished by its innovative features, including openness, user participation, and the facilitation of content creation and sharing. This technological evolution transformed how people interact, enabling users to produce and share personalized content online rather than merely consuming existing material.

In nine studies ( N = 2,320; three preregistered), we find that perceived automation threat drives people to prioritize creative skills over technical and social skills. A pilot study revealed that people view creativity as less prone to automation and more likely to complement automation. Subsequent experiments confirmed that automation threat leads people to highlight creativity in job applications (Studies 1a–1c), leads STEM students and professional graphic designers to cultivate creative abilities (Studies 2a–2b), and increases jobseekers’ interest in companies that champion creativity (Study 3). People value creative skills in response to the automation threat even when reminded of generative AI’s ability for creativity (Studies 4a–4b). These results suggest that advanced technology steers individuals to prioritize creativity as a skill necessary to compete in the labor market.",CrossRef,81.28205128205127,Goal 4,0.01628856927205059,False,

Much of the abuse stems from failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Unedited and unselected results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. Considerable non-replication is thus to be expected even with honest and complete reporting practices, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between model predictions and data, rather than as generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, and what analysis methods were used.",CrossRef,81.16279069767441,Goal 3,0.0213252869620186,False,

In this paper, we present and analyze a model that explores the interaction between a worker's production autonomy and chosen breadth of training. This model helps explain why existing observations and the literature are mixed regarding whether lean initiatives accompany production autonomy. We also present empirically testable hypotheses that highlight interesting model insights. Finally, we use results from our model to argue that an efficient company attempting to become leaner by “doing more with less” is likely to lower the size of the workforce and lower production autonomy.",CrossRef,81.06382978723404,Goal 12,0.01905628331244437,False,

Historically, the most prevalent way to help the global poor was by providing in-kind asset transfers. Recently, alternatives to in-kind aid, such as cash aid, have been increasing in prevalence. Although there has been widespread endorsement from the academic community and the public on the popularizing model of giving cash aid, one perspective remains untouched: the recipient’s perspective. Thus, the present research explores how food-insecure individuals feel when receiving money vs. in-kind food aid to help meet their hunger and nutrition needs. Specifically, we explore the degree of positive (e.g., feeling cared for) and negative (e.g., feeling ashamed) social emotions felt when receiving the aid opportunity and how willing recipients are to accept monetary (vs. food) aid. Results from five preregistered experiments ( N = 3,110)—a field experiment in Kenya and four online experiments in the United States—find that monetary (vs. food) aid elicits comparatively more of a market-pricing relationship and less of a communal sharing relationship and, hence, makes people feel less positive and more negative social emotions when receiving the help. Subsequently, recipients are less likely to take up monetary (vs. food) aid from a charity. However, we find that this effect does not persist when receiving government aid: Recipients are similarly willing to accept money and in-kind food aid from the government. This research suggests that future scholarship ought to examine ways to improve psychological experiences when receiving money from charity.",CrossRef,80.9090909090909,Goal 2,0.1503251211459988,True,food insecurity; food policy solutions; food security; hunger; moderate food insecurity; nutritional needs; severe food insecurity; sufficient food

Zajac,2021,"The corporate scandals and market crashes of the 2000s generated significant criticism of the shareholder value orientation (SVO) in the USA. We offer a sociopolitical analysis of how this criticism triggered changes in stock-based executive compensation, a central practice associated with the SVO. We first analyze how corporate stakeholders redefined different forms of stock-based compensation, motivated new regulations and wielded direct challenges to specific firms. We then predict how firm-specific differences in external challenges and intra-firm power relationships were related to changes in the use of stock options and restricted stock grants (RSGs), testing our predictions using a longitudinal dataset of S&P 500 executives between 2002 and 2012. We find that firms facing negative media coverage of their executive compensation practices made less use of both forms of stock-based compensation, while firms facing shareholder activism only made less use of stock options, the form that was more heavily criticized. In addition, firms with more powerful CEOs utilized RSGs more heavily and did so even when facing media criticism. Our findings demonstrate that while stock options were vulnerable to change, stock-based compensation remained resilient because the structural power of CEOs, a core corporate governance feature of the SVO, also remained resilient.",CrossRef,80.0,Goal 9,0.009027680592162413,False,
