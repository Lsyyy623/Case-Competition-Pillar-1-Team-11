Journal of Applied Psychology. doi:10.5465/AMBPP.2019.12281ABSTRACT",2019,"Kim, (2019) Do financial incentives help or harm performance in interesting tasks?","There continues to be disagreement about whether financial incentives help or harm performance, especially in interesting tasks. Although the Jenkins, Mitra, Gupta, and Shaw (1998) meta-analysis finds a positive effect of incentives, including in interesting tasks (reported ρ ^ = +.34; our computed δ = +.79), a more recent and widely cited meta-analysis by Weibel et al. (2010) reports, in contrast, a negative effect (δ = -.13) of incentives on performance in interesting tasks. Thus, the effect size for interesting tasks differs by .92 standard deviation (SD) between the two meta-analyses, a very large difference. We incorporate primary studies from these two meta-analyses and other sources in a new, more complete meta-analysis of incentives-performance in interesting and noninteresting tasks. We also examine additional key moderators (incentive intensity, how motivation-driven performance is, and autonomy). We find that the incentives-performance relationship is positive in both interesting (δ = +.58) and noninteresting tasks (δ = +.52). In addition, we find that the positive incentives-performance relationship is robust to not only task interest, but also to incentive intensity, how motivation-driven performance is, and autonomy. However, the incentives-performance relationship is less positive for performance measured as quality, especially in interesting tasks. We provide suggestions for future research.

Environmental management practices have accelerated with the conscious acts of businesses on environmental issues since they have the greatest responsibility for environmental pollution. After the 2000s, businesses have started to prefer to be a part of the solution rather than being at the center of the problem and tended to green business and management practices. For improved environmental performance, sustainable competitive advantage, and environmental management, environmental consciousness should be taken into consideration in each and every human resource function ranging from recruitment to training of employees, from performance assessment to rewarding.

This model indicates that consumers should purchase a low limit and retain much of their exposure due to the high premium loads in our sample.

Previous research has typically examined modest stakes choices, such as appliance warranties and deductibles, leaving important questions about larger stakes decisions. Features of U.S. flood insurance allow us to model risk attitudes over large stakes from consumers’ coverage limits. We find that consumers are typically willing to pay premiums well above the expected value of their contracts, though consumers’ decisions vary substantially over large stakes.

In this program, private insurers sell identical flood contracts at identical rates and bear no risk of paying claims. About 12 percent of new policyholders overinsure, selecting a coverage limit that exceeds their home's estimated replacement cost. Overinsuring is expensive relative to expected loss, making it difficult to explain with standard decision‐making models. The rate of overinsuring differs substantially across insurers, ranging from zero to one‐third of new policies. Insurer effects on the likelihood of overinsuring are statistically significant after controlling for the policyholder's characteristics. Additionally, some insurers seem to encourage households to overinsure in percentage terms (e.g., buy 110 percent of replacement cost) while others encourage rounding up in dollars (e.g., to the next $ 10,000).

Predicting a patient’s progression to septic shock is an active field of translational research. The goal of this study was to develop a working model of a clinical decision support system for predicting septic shock in an acute care setting for up to 6 h from the time of admission in an integrated healthcare setting. Method: Clinical data from Electronic Health Record (EHR), at encounter level, were used to build a predictive model for progression from sepsis to septic shock up to 6 h from the time of admission; that is, T = 1, 3, and 6 h from admission. Eight different machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, C5.0, Decision Trees, Boosted Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Regularized Logistic, and Bayes Generalized Linear Model) were used for model development. Two adaptive sampling strategies were used to address the class imbalance. Data from two sources (clinical and billing codes) were used to define the case definition (septic shock) using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Sepsis criteria. The model assessment was performed using Area under Receiving Operator Characteristics (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. Model predictions for each feature window (1, 3 and 6 h from admission) were consolidated. Results: Retrospective data from April 2005 to September 2018 were extracted from the EHR, Insurance Claims, Billing, and Laboratory Systems to create a dataset for septic shock detection. The clinical criteria and billing information were used to label patients into two classes-septic shock patients and sepsis patients at three different time points from admission, creating two different case-control cohorts. Data from 45,425 unique in-patient visits were used to build 96 prediction models comparing clinical-based definition versus billing-based information as the gold standard. Of the 24 consolidated models (based on eight machine learning algorithms and three feature windows), four models reached an AUROC greater than 0.9. Overall, all the consolidated models reached an AUROC of at least 0.8820 or higher. Based on the AUROC of 0.9483, the best model was based on Random Forest, with a sensitivity of 83.9% and specificity of 88.1%. The sepsis detection window at 6 h outperformed the 1 and 3-h windows. The sepsis definition based on clinical variables had improved performance when compared to the sepsis definition based on only billing information. Conclusion: This study corroborated that machine learning models can be developed to predict septic shock using clinical and administrative data. However, the use of clinical information to define septic shock outperformed models developed based on only administrative data. Intelligent decision support tools can be developed and integrated into the EHR and improve clinical outcomes and facilitate the optimization of resources in real-time.",Crossref,100.0,10.3390/jcm10020301,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10020301,2021.0,Goal 15,0.02393772147130015,False,

Models with high sensitivity and specificity would enable programs to target more elaborate screening efforts to high-risk populations, while minimizing overtreatment for the rest. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk models have demonstrated a significant advance over risk models used today in clinical practice. However, the responsible deployment of novel AI requires careful validation across diverse populations. To this end, we validate our AI-based model, Mirai, across globally diverse screening populations. METHODS We collected screening mammograms and pathology-confirmed breast cancer outcomes from Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; Novant, USA; Emory, USA; Maccabi-Assuta, Israel; Karolinska, Sweden; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan; and Barretos, Brazil. We evaluated Uno's concordance index for Mirai in predicting risk of breast cancer at one to five years from the mammogram. RESULTS A total of 128,793 mammograms from 62,185 patients were collected across the seven sites, of which 3,815 were followed by a cancer diagnosis within 5 years. Mirai obtained concordance indices of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.79), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.81), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.82), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.83), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.88) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Novant, Emory, Maccabi-Assuta, Karolinska, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Barretos, respectively.

We posit that these two important contextual factors influence managers' audit quality preferences. We study these factors because they are ubiquitous to companies, and we focus on their influence on managers because managers continue to play a significant role in the auditor hiring process and we know relatively little about their auditor preferences. We predict that risk, the potential for loss, and their interaction will each decrease manager demand for high audit quality due to a desire to achieve greater reporting flexibility. Experimental results are consistent with our predictions; specifically, increased risk, the potential for loss, and to a lesser extent their interaction, significantly reduce managers' likelihood of hiring the best available auditor in the market. Path analysis indicates that this reduction in audit quality demand leads to increases in misreporting. Finally, we observe investors overpaying for assets to a greater extent when managers hire lower‐quality auditors. Our results show that the contextual factors of risk and the potential for loss, which are ubiquitous to companies, can reduce demand for audit quality, which can increase misreporting behavior and ultimately harm investors.",Crossref,94.03973509933775,10.1111/1911-3846.12682,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12682,2021.0,Goal 1,0.01343550167128162,False,

Findings The findings support a U-shaped association between national-industry inequality and audit fees. As inequality initially increases, fees decrease; however, as inequality becomes increasingly large fees increase. The city-industry level analysis shows the opposite pattern. The results are consistent with capacity constraints at the national-industry level that are less binding at the city-industry level.

We do not find differences in audit quality by condition in our planned analysis, however we find greater variation in audit quality in the conditions where auditors provide consulting services compared to the baseline. In unplanned analyses, our results suggest providing consulting services increases auditor cooperation with managers, increasing audit quality when managers prefer high audit quality and decreasing audit quality when managers prefer low audit quality.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12197,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12197,2018.0,Goal 1,0.0235227889442585,False,

An effective session should include a team environment in which all members are willing to share information to appropriately calibrate the collective assessment of fraud risk. We report the results of a study (Gissel and Johnstone 2017) in which we manipulate partner leadership in terms of engendering a safe (unsafe) psychological environment whereby subordinates are (are not) encouraged to speak up about fraud-relevant information. Participants are audit staff and seniors, and through the experimental case (based on the Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation fraud) they come to realize that they alone possess fraud-relevant information critical to the team's calibration of fraud risk. These auditors participate in a simulated brainstorming session containing the partner leadership manipulation and indicate changes in their willingness to share the fraud-relevant information with the team. We find that less-knowledgeable auditors become more willing to share their privately known, fraud-relevant information when the partner engenders a safe psychological environment as compared to an unsafe environment. In contrast, more-knowledgeable auditors are impervious to the relative psychological safety engendered by the partner; these individuals are equally willing to speak up regardless of the partner's leadership behavior.

Theory predicts that managers will demand high levels of audit quality to avoid investors' price-protecting behavior. This demand should result in the HQ auditor dominating the market and increase other auditors' audit quality provision to compete with the HQ auditor. However, we find that the HQ auditor does not dominate the market—despite holding audit costs constant and investors placing a premium on HQ auditor reports. We also find that adding an HQ auditor results in other auditors lowering audit quality. Additional analyses indicate some managers demand lower audit quality to avoid negative audit reports, consistent with loss aversion as a potential explanation. Our findings indicate a need to develop a more comprehensive theory of the demand for auditing.

We find local supply and demand factors are significantly associated with non-Big 4 local market leadership and that non-Big 4 leadership is associated with lower overall audit fees in the local market. We also find that non-Big 4 leaders earn a fee premium over other non-Big 4 auditors. Our results imply that non-Big 4 leaders increase local market competition.

Specifically, we manipulate auditors' economic accountability to managers by altering who hires the auditor—a manager or an independent third party—and auditors' psychological accountability to investors by explicitly stating that the auditor is hired on the investors' behalf. Our design shifts auditors' accountability from managers, who have directional goal preferences, to investors, who prefer judgment accuracy. We find that removing auditors' economic accountability to managers and replacing it with psychological accountability to investors significantly increases audit quality. This increase in audit quality occurs despite the independent third party randomly hiring auditors. In an additional treatment, we incorporate auditor accuracy into the third-party hiring algorithm and find even higher audit quality. Our results suggest that altering auditors' accountability relationships can significantly enhance audit quality.

Using a utility-based framework, the authors develop hypotheses on how the impact of these shocks on brand equity is moderated by six strategic brand factors: price positioning, advertising spending, product line length, distribution breadth, brand architecture, and market position. The authors utilize monthly data on 325 national consumer packaged goods brands in 35 categories across 17 years from the United Kingdom to obtain quarterly sales-based brand equity estimates. The two preeminent brand factors are distribution and assortment. Distribution is by far the most important factor in contractions. It is also the most important factor in expansions. In short, in good times and bad times, extensively distributed brands win. A wide assortment is also a strong contributor to brand equity in expansions, while it does not destroy brand equity in contractions. The authors further find that advertising spending, premium price positioning, umbrella branding structure, and market leadership matter in expansions and/or contractions, and the magnitude of their effects on brand equity is relatively modest.

To excel in the initial years of their careers as effective salespersons, students might emphasize sales-orientation or target achievement over customer-orientation. This might force them to choose manipulative practices in their professional lives. The orientation also depends upon the gender and prior sales experience of the students. Thus, if the instructors could assess the students’ orientation, i.e., sales-orientation or customer-orientation, which they would practice during the job in advance, they could mentor them with proper inputs. The present study is an attempt to predict such orientations of the students by using a modified version of the SOCO scale.

The hypotheses are tested based on 603 firm-quarter observations spanning 80 firms over six years in the online financial services industry. The results suggest that while WP lowers the volatility of cash flows, it only enables firms to charge premium prices when online trust is high. Additional tests reveal that the reduction in cash flow volatility is because of lower churn as opposed to acquiring new customers or greater cross-buying. Finally, online trust positively moderates the relationships between WP and cash flow volatility and price premia.

It is a common symptom in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients of yet unknown nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of pruritus in CHF patients. Methods For this monocentric, prospective cohort study, CHF patients were recruited and CHF symptoms, comorbidities and drug intake were assessed using a structured report. Additionally, a questionnaire evaluated pruritus symptoms. Detailed medical histories including laboratory test results were retrieved from patient files for all participants. Results We evaluated data from 550 CHF patients. Of those, 25.3% reported pruritus to occur frequently (3–5 times per week), often (1–2 times per week) or daily. Patients of higher NYHA classes (NYHA III + IV) experienced significantly more pruritus (31.2%) than lower NYHA classes (NYHA I + II) (21.1%, p = 0.024). Patients with pruritus reported disproportionately often concomitant stasis dermatitis ( p = 0.026) and chronic lung disease ( p = 0.014). Other parameters reflecting cardiac, liver, kidney and thyroid function, as well as medical therapies showed no significant differences between patients with and without pruritus. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only NYHA class ( p = 0.016, OR 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI): [1.09; 2.20]) and elevated leukocyte count ( p = 0.007, OR 1.11, CI [1.03; 1.21]) remained significantly associated with pruritus in CHF patients. Conclusions NYHA class is an independent predictor for pruritus in CHF patients. Besides NYHA class, leukocyte count was also associated with increased pruritus. Pruritus may impair QoL in CHF patients and should thus be included in the assessment of those patients. We suggest that providing best care for CHF patients can be achieved through an interdisciplinary approach of cardiologists and dermatologists and should include a pruritus assessment.",Crossref,93.27731092436974,10.1111/jdv.19931,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.19931,2024.0,Goal 3,0.004622898642906622,False,

Recurrent anaphylaxis following vespid stings may be prevented by allergen immunotherapy (AIT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of measuring venom-induced wheal area in intracutaneous skin tests (ICT), in comparison to various serological and clinical parameters, for the diagnosis of severe vespid venom allergy and during follow-up of AIT. Methods: We conducted a monocentric, retrospective evaluation of 170 patients undergoing AIT against vespid venoms. We scanned ICT wheals at baseline and at three time points after AIT initiation and measured wheal area using objective data analysis software. Results: We found that ICT histamine-induced and venom-induced wheal areas did not correlate. In addition, the venom-induced wheal area was independent from the minimal venom concentration required to elicit a wheal in an ICT and all other parameters. No correlation was found between wheal area and the severity of anaphylaxis. Wheal area standardized to the application of 0.1 μg/mL venom inversely correlated with anaphylaxis severity and positively correlated with venom-specific IgE levels. During AIT, mean areas of venom-induced wheals did not change. In contrast, venom-specific IgG and IgG4 levels, and the minimal venom concentration required to induce a positive ICT result increased, while the venom wheal area standardized to 0.1 μg/mL venom application and specific IgE levels decreased over time. Conclusion: Wheal area evaluation did not provide additional information over specific IgE analysis.

European Journal of Immunology. doi:10.1002/eji.202249982",2023,"Albrecht, (2023) Epithelial–immune cell interactions in allergic diseases","Abstract Epithelial/immune interactions are characterized by the different properties of the various epithelial tissues, the mediators involved, and the varying immune cells that initiate, sustain, or abrogate allergic diseases on the surface. The intestinal mucosa, respiratory mucosa, and regular skin feature structural differences according to their primary function and surroundings. In the context of these specialized functions, the active role of the epithelium in shaping immune responses is increasingly recognizable. Crosstalk between epithelial and immune cells plays an important role in maintaining homeostatic conditions. While cells of the myeloid cell lineage, mainly macrophages, are the dominating immune cell population in the skin and the respiratory tract, lymphocytes comprise most intraepithelial immune cells in the intestine under healthy conditions. Common to all surface epithelia is the fact that innate immune cells represent the first line of immunosurveillance that either directly defeats invading pathogens or initiates and coordinates more effective successive immune responses involving adaptive immune cells and effector cells. Pharmacological approaches for the treatment of allergic and chronic inflammatory diseases involving epithelial barriers target immunological mediators downstream of the epithelium (such as IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐13, and IgE).

A decrease in the number of allergens included in standard SPT panels has recently been debated – particularly regarding the cross-reacting homologous pollen from birch, alder, and hazel trees – but has not yet been implemented in clinical guidelines. Methods: A subgroup of patients with AR (n = 69) who showed inconsistent SPT results among birch, alder, and hazel was investigated in detail. Beyond SPT, patient workup included assessment of clinical relevance and various serological parameters (total IgE, and specific IgE to birch, alder, and hazel and to Bet v 1, Bet v 2, and Bet v 4). Results: More than half the study group had negative SPT results for birch but positive results for alder and/or hazel, and 87% of the study group was polysensitized, showing at least one more positive SPT result for other plants. Whereas 30.4% of patients showed serological sensitization to birch pollen extract, only 18.8% displayed positive specific IgE to Bet v 1. Clinical assessment revealed that most patients with AR were polysensitized and had perennial symptoms or symptoms also occurring during times other than tree flowering times. If the SPT panel is limited to testing birch only, 52.2% of patients in this subgroup would have been overlooked. Conclusion: Inconsistent SPT results in the birch homologous group may result from cross-reacting allergens or technical errors.

The study yielded a response rate of 52.1% (n = 468). Results: Overall, 88.5% of clinics agreed that allergological care in Germany needs improvement, especially in terms of reimbursement for diagnostics and therapy. More than 80% of participating clinics reported that the decreased availability of test substances and the time-intensity of allergological testing represent relevant barriers. For dermatology and pulmonology, the former is the strongest barrier, while for pediatric and ENT clinics, time-intensity is regarded as the strongest barrier.

Risk assessment for subjects with suspected allergy is difficult because there are currently no biomarkers that predict the likelihood of high-grade anaphylaxis other than several associated comorbidities. Objective We investigated the relationship between the severity of anaphylaxis and the results of intracutaneous skin tests (ICTs) together with serum levels of tryptase, total IgE, and venom-specific IgE, IgG, and IgG4. Methods We performed a retrospective evaluation of 194 patients who presented to a single medical center with allergies to bee venoms (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp.; n=24, 12.4%), vespid venoms (Vespula spp., Vespa spp., Polistes spp.; n=169, 87.1%), or both (n=1, 0.5%). Results Index bee stings occurred earlier in the year than vespid stings, although the latter were reported more frequently overall. On average, subjects who previously experienced grade IV anaphylaxis required higher dosages of venom to yield positive ICTs than those who exhibited lower grade responses. Patients diagnosed with grade IV anaphylaxis exhibited significantly lower levels of venom-specific IgE and IgG and trended toward elevated levels of tryptase. No significant differences in average levels of venom-specific IgG4 and total IgE were observed.

During recent years, mango fruit has enjoyed increasing popularity in Western Europe and elsewhere. Anaphylaxis induced by mango ingestion has been rarely reported [1–5]. Besides anaphylaxis, also delayed hypersensitivity reactions to mango have been reported anecdotally [2]. We report the case of a 16-year-old girl who presented with anaphylaxis to our emergency department. Thirty minutes after ingestion of a fruit salad (apple, kiwi, mango, grapes), she developed generalized pruritus, facial angioedema, abdominal pain, and dyspnoea. After admission to the hospital, she recovered after treatment with adrenaline, antihistamines, and corticosteroids. She had no history of any allergy, anaphylaxis, or atopy. She also denied previous food allergies or allergy on contact with latex products. Some months later, the patient experienced another event of anaphylaxis after ingestion of mango with pruritus, urticaria, dyspnoea, and vomiting. Allergological workup of this case included skin-prick tests (SPTs) with commercial extracts of aeroallergens to diagnose atopy and possible cross-sensitizations. Histamine hydrochloride (10 mg/ml, Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany) was used as positive control, and saline solution as negative control (Allergopharma). The results were read after 15 min, and a wheal size ≥ 3 mm was rated positive according to national guidelines. SPT was positive to tree pollen including olive tree, grass, and weed pollen (mugwort, ragweed, plantain). SPTs were found negative for house dust mites, animal and mould allergens. SPT with fresh pistachio was positive, while SPTs with commercial nut extracts were negative (hazelnut, peanut, walnut, Brazil nut, and almond). Serum analysis for total immunoglobulin (Ig) E was 453 kU/l. Specific IgE to mango was found to be 3.17 kUA/l, apple 1.3 kUA/l, kiwi 2.4 kU A /l, and latex 2.68 kU A /l. Negative results were obtained for pistachio nut, grapes, and the birch major allergen Bet v1. Extended blood testing by chip technology (ISAC, Thermo Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) revealed positive Art v1 (12.0 ISU-E), Art v3 (0.4 ISU-E), Phl p1 (18.0 ISU-E), Hev b8 (10.0 ISU-E) and positive profilins (Table 1). To better classify the relevance of the results, an inhibition test with fresh mango fruit was performed as described previously [2]. Cross-reactivity to Art v1, Bet v2 and Hev b8 could be confirmed (Table 2). After finalization of blood and skin tests, the patient underwent single-blinded placebo-controlled food challenge tests in our department. A maximum challenge with 16.7 g of pistachio nuts (cumulative dose 24.8 g) was tolerated without any reaction. On the next day, after ingestion of a dose of 85.0 g of mango fruit (cumulative dose 151.0 g) the girl developed urticaria, facial angioedema, and dyspnoea. The symptoms diminished after administration of intravenous prednisolone and antihistamines. In conclusion, we diagnosed an isolated mango fruit allergy. Besides genuine allergy, various cross-sensitizations may be responsible for a rare mango fruit allergy. Based on botanical similarities of the family of Anacardiaceae, cross-reactivity to latex (formerly described as “latex-fruit syndrome”), profilins and other pan-allergens, and crossreactivity to birch and/or mugwort allergens need to be considered and evaluated: 1. Earlier inhibition tests demonstrated cross-reactivity between mango fruits, mugwort, and birch pollen, mediated by Bet v1 and/or Art v1 [3]. In our case presented here, sIgE to Bet v1 was negative and therefore, we hypothesized a cross-reaction of a primary mugwort sensitization to mango fruit mediated by the defensin Art v1, and/or by the non-specific lipid transfer protein Art v3 [2]. Other case reports supported cross-reactivity to mugwort in mango allergy as well [4, 6], and this is the most probable cause of the mango fruit allergy in our patient.

Although Serpin E1 is implicated in chronic itch, its receptor and signaling pathways involved in itch are not known. In this study, the clinical relevance of a putative Serpin E1 receptor PLAUR to chronic itch, and the neuro‐cutaneous Serpin E1‐PLAUR signaling are explored. We found that PLAUR is overexpressed in skin specimens of human lesional AD and lesional psoriasis, and sensory neurons innervating MC903‐induced AD‐like murine skin. Murine PLAUR + sensory neurons responded to Serpin E1, resulting in enrichment of numerous itch‐ and inflammation‐related genes and their protein release. PLAUR resides in TLR2 + neurons and Serpin E1 stimulus led to transcriptional upregulation of TLR2 and its co‐signaling proteins. Agonists of TLR2 propagated itch‐related gene transcription including BNP, OSM, and PAR2. OSM induced acute itch in mice and promoted G‐CSF and IL‐8 release from human keratinocytes. Serpin E1 inhibitor reduced MC903‐induced itch, epidermal hyperplasia, immunocyte infiltration, and resulted in lower transcription/expression levels of Serpin E1 and OSM. Taken together, the PLAUR‐TLR2‐OSM signaling promotes skin‐nerve communication, cutaneous inflammation, and itch, all feeding into an aggravation of AD and exaggerated itch circuits.",Crossref,100.0,10.1096/fj.202200079r,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202200079r,2022.0,Goal 16,0.008569090552345025,False,

Results Of 70 867 patients patch tested with benzyl alcohol 1% pet., 146 (0.21%) showed a positive reaction, most of them (89%) only weakly positive. The number of doubtful and irritant reactions significantly exceeded the number of positive reactions. Reproducibility of positive test reactions was low. Among benzyl alcohol‐positive patients, compared to benzyl alcohol‐negative patients, there were significantly more patients with leg dermatitis (17.8% vs. 8.6%), more patients aged 40 years or more (81.5% vs. 70.5%) and more patients who were tested because of a suspected intolerance reaction to topical medications (34.9% vs. 16.6%). Concomitant positive reactions were mainly seen to fragrances, preservatives and ointment bases. Conclusions Sensitization to benzyl alcohol occurs very rarely, mainly in patients with stasis dermatitis.

These include both the course and treatment of diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause considerable immunological alterations, which particularly also affect pathogenetically and/or therapeutically relevant factors. Against this background we summarize here the current state of knowledge on the interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19 with mediators of the acute phase of inflammation (TNF, IL‐1, IL‐6), type 1 and type 17 immune responses (IL‐12, IL‐23, IL‐17, IL‐36), type 2 immune reactions (IL‐4, IL‐13, IL‐5, IL‐31, IgE), B‐cell immunity, checkpoint regulators (PD‐1, PD‐L1, CTLA4), and orally druggable signaling pathways (JAK, PDE4, calcineurin). In addition, we discuss in this context non‐specific immune modulation by glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate, antimalarial drugs, azathioprine, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil and fumaric acid esters, as well as neutrophil granulocyte‐mediated innate immune mechanisms. From these recent findings we derive possible implications for the therapeutic modulation of said immunological mechanisms in connection with SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19. Although, of course, the greatest care should be taken with patients with immunologically mediated diseases or immunomodulating therapies, it appears that many treatments can also be carried out during the COVID‐19 pandemic; some even appear to alleviate COVID‐19.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/ddg.14169,https://doi.org/10.1111/ddg.14169,2020.0,Goal 3,0.03021186147543751,False,COVID-19 impact

The prevalence is increasing, especially in Western countries. We aimed to investigate (1) sensitization rates and (2) cross‐sensitization patterns in skin prick tests (SPTs) for the most relevant inhaled allergens in central Germany over 20 years, adjusted for regional pollen counts. Patients and Methods: This monocentric study evaluated SPTs for tree pollen, grass pollen and house dust mites (HDMs) in 4,315 patients (including children) with suspected airway allergies, from 1998–2017. Results: Sensitization rates to almost all aeroallergens have increased significantly over time, without relevant changes in regional pollen counts. Current sensitization rates in all our symptomatic patients were highest for grass (55.3 %) and rye pollen (59.6 %), with most pronounced increases in HDM sensitization over time (from 37.8 % to the current figure of 50.1 %). However, a low but consistent proportion of tree‐sensitized patients (3.6–7.8 %) showed isolated positive SPTs to alder and/or hazel pollen without sensitization to birch pollen.

However, understanding the precise role of PAR2 on neuro-immune communication in AD has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models. Methods: We used a recently established mouse model with epidermal overexpression of PAR2 (PAR2OE) and littermate WT mice to study the impact of increased PAR2 expression in epidermal cells on spontaneous and house dust mite (HDM)-induced skin inflammation, itch, and barrier dysfunction in AD, in vivo and ex vivo. Results: PAR2OE newborns displayed no overt abnormalities, but spontaneously developed dry skin, severe pruritus, and eczema. Dermatological, neurophysiological, and immunological analyses revealed the hallmarks of AD-like skin disease. Skin barrier defects were observed before onset of skin lesions. Application of HDM onto PAR2OE mice triggered pruritus and the skin phenotype. PAR2OE mice displayed an increased density of nerve fibers, increased nerve growth factor and endothelin-1 expression levels, alloknesis, enhanced scratching (hyperknesis), and responses of dorsal root ganglion cells to non-histaminergic pruritogens. Conclusion: PAR2 in keratinocytes, activated by exogenous and endogenous proteases, is sufficient to drive barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and pruritus and sensitize skin to the effects of HDM in a mouse model that mimics human AD.

Both proteins have been implicated as essential proteins for skin barrier maintenance. Loss‐of‐function mutations of these genes constitute a risk factor for atopic dermatitis and eczema‐related asthma. Furthermore, both FLG and HRNR protein levels are downregulated in patients with atopic dermatitis. Thus, mice deficient for Flg and Hrnr provide a novel model to study skin barrier impairment and the susceptibility for cutaneous inflammation. Methods By using appropriate targeting vectors and breeding strategies, we established a homozygous FlgHrnr double‐deficient ( FlgHrnr −/− ) mouse model lacking both genes including the intergenomic sequence. Results Neonates appeared normal, but developed a transient scaly phenotype with overall flaky appearance, but no overt skin phenotype in adulthood, thereby reflecting a subclinical barrier defect seen in humans. Structurally, FlgHrnr −/− mice displayed a markedly reduced granular layer and a condensed cornified layer. Functionally, FlgHrnr −/− mice showed permeability abnormalities and metabolic aberrations regarding the production of natural moisturizing factors (NMFs) in the stratum corneum . Surprisingly, although the immune system revealed no aberrations under steady‐state conditions, FlgHrnr −/− mice are predisposed to mount an allergic contact dermatitis, especially at hapten threshold levels eliciting allergic reactions.

Patients and methods As part of the OCCUDERM project, occupational exposure of 230 metalworkers with suspected OD patch tested in the departments of dermatology in Göttingen and Osnabrück (both Lower Saxony, Germany) in 2012–2017 was recorded by questionnaire. These data, as well as results, of patch testing with standardized allergens and with workplace material were analysed. Results Metalworking fluids and skin care products were the most important exposures. Among MWF allergens, most frequently sensitizations to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers, colophony/abietic acid and monoethanolamine were observed. Sensitization to methylisothiazolinone ( MI ) was frequent, probably as part of the general European epidemic of contact allergy to MI in leave‐on cosmetics. Sensitization to glove ingredients only played a minor role. Conclusions The known occupational allergen spectrum could largely be confirmed.

Since various weeds flower during summer until fall, allergic rhinitis to weeds may be underdiagnosed and/or mistakenly diagnosed as grass pollen allergy. Objective: To investigate (i) the currently most frequent weed allergy between mugwort, ragweed, plantain, chamomile, nettle, and oilseed rape and (ii) time trends in prevalence of sensitization to weed pollen in the middle of Germany over the last 20 years. Methods: This study, the largest of its kind to date, monocentrically evaluated the prick test results of a total of 6,220 patients with suspected RCA over a period of 20 years (1998–2017). Results: In the study cohort, sensitization rates to plantain almost doubled from 26.6% in the decade 1998–2007 to 50.5% in 2008–2017. Identical increases were observed for ragweed, while sensitization rates for mugwort stayed largely unchanged. The most prominent increase in positive skin prick tests to plantain and ragweed pollen was mainly observed in younger patients. Further, we identified a trend toward polysensitization, currently dominated by plantain and ragweed. Sensitization to weed pollen was found to be highly associated with additional sensitizations to grass and/or birch pollen. Conclusion: Plantain is currently the best choice to screen rhinitis patients for weed allergy which identifies 86% of all weed-sensitized individuals, at least in Germany. Over the last 20 years, we demonstrate a significant rise in the total number of weed pollen sensitization as well as increases in polysensitization, predominantly in younger patients.",Crossref,100.0,10.1159/000504297,https://doi.org/10.1159/000504297,2019.0,Goal 13,0.0008423550942791019,False,

International Archives of Allergy and Immunology. doi:10.1159/000492191",2018,"Saleh, (2018) Profile Shift in Latex Sensitization over the Last 20 Years","Background: Natural rubber latex (NRL) allergy is commonly diagnosed according to medical history, skin allergy tests, and serological analyses. However, skin tests are increasingly being abandoned because of (i) their time-consuming nature, (ii) latex preparations for skin tests being not commercially available, and (iii) the use of in-house prepared test solutions is becoming ever more difficult due to increasing regulatory hurdles. In this light, we have evaluated differences in the profiles of current and former patients with suspected latex allergy. Methods: Sera of skin test-positive patients from a historic cohort (1995–2001, n = 149 patients) and currently (2014–2015, n = 48 patients) were simultaneously analyzed for specific IgE to latex by ImmunoCAP. If the serological screening was positive (≥0.35 kU/L), component-resolved diagnostics including profilins and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) were performed. Results: In contrast to 88% (131/149) of the skin test-positive patients from the 1990s, only 51.1% (24/47) of the current cohort were found positive for specific IgE to latex. While 48.3% (72/149) of the patients had a convincing positive history in the 1990s, current skin test-positive patients rarely reported a relevant medical history (8.5%, 4/47). Specific IgE levels to latex were significantly higher in former patients with suspected latex allergy ( p &#x3c; 0.001) than in former sensitized individuals without allergy. However, this significant difference was lost in current allergic and sensitized patients with positive skin tests. Conclusion: Sensitization profiles in patients with latex allergy have changed significantly over the last 2 decades. Discrimination between NRL sensitization and clinical allergy remains a diagnostic challenge. Our data highlight the need for a combination of all 3 criteria, i.e., patient history, skin test, and analysis of specific IgE, for a correct diagnosis of latex allergy.",Crossref,100.0,10.1159/000492191,https://doi.org/10.1159/000492191,2018.0,Goal 10,0.006888771841009974,False,

Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN's diagnostic performance to larger groups of dermatologists are lacking.


Methods
Google's Inception v4 CNN architecture was trained and validated using dermoscopic images and corresponding diagnoses. In a comparative cross-sectional reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by the CNN versus an international group of 58 dermatologists during level-I or -II of the reader study. Secondary end points included the dermatologists' diagnostic performance in their management decisions and differences in the diagnostic performance of dermatologists during level-I and -II of the reader study. Additionally, the CNN's performance was compared with the top-five algorithms of the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) challenge.


Results
In level-I dermatologists achieved a mean (±standard deviation) sensitivity and specificity for lesion classification of 86.6% (±9.3%) and 71.3% (±11.2%), respectively. More clinical information (level-II) improved the sensitivity to 88.9% (±9.6%, P = 0.19) and specificity to 75.7% (±11.7%, P < 0.05). The CNN ROC curve revealed a higher specificity of 82.5% when compared with dermatologists in level-I (71.3%, P < 0.01) and level-II (75.7%, P < 0.01) at their sensitivities of 86.6% and 88.9%, respectively. The CNN ROC AUC was greater than the mean ROC area of dermatologists (0.86 versus 0.79, P < 0.01). The CNN scored results close to the top three algorithms of the ISBI 2016 challenge.


Conclusions
For the first time we compared a CNN's diagnostic performance with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts. Most dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN. Irrespective of any physicians' experience, they may benefit from assistance by a CNN's image classification.

Methods Patients with previous melanoma ( n = 347, median age at diagnosis: 56.5 years, 44.7% female, 55.3% male) were recruited for this monocentre, non‐randomized, observational study between April 2012 and March 2013. All patients were assessed by means of a structured interview and systematic clinical and dermoscopic full‐body examination. Melanoma thickness in association with patients’ characteristics, risk indicators and patterns of diagnosis was submitted to statistical analyses. Results Univariate analyses revealed associations between a statistically significant lower Breslow thickness and participation in specialized dermoscopic screening programs, personal history of more than one previous melanoma, diagnostic examination with a dermatoscope, diagnostic examination by board certified dermatologist, high number of common and/or atypical nevi, younger age at time of diagnosis, higher level of education, or superficial spreading or lentigo maligna melanoma subtype (all P ≤ 0.01). In a multivariate regression analysis only three of these criteria: (i) participation in specialized screening programs ( P 0.0001); (ii) melanoma subtype ( P 0.0001); and (iii) diagnostic examination with a dermatoscope ( P = 0.040) and one interaction term (‘younger age’ x ‘female sex’, P 0.0001) showed an independent influence on a significantly lower melanoma thickness. Conclusions The screening of patients in specialized surveillance programs resulted in melanoma detection at significantly earlier stages. The use of dermoscopy, SSM or LMM histotype and younger age in connection with female sex were also characteristics that were independently associated with significantly thinner melanomas in multivariate analyses.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/jdv.12471,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.12471,2014.0,Goal 4,0.02525905845558735,False,

Our physics-informed machine-learning workflow addresses the challenges to real-time reservoir management in unconventionals, namely the lack of data (i.e., the time-frame for which the wells have been producing), and the significant computational expense of high-fidelity modeling. We do this by applying the machine-learning paradigm of transfer learning, where we combine fast, but less accurate reduced-order models with slow, but accurate high-fidelity models. We use the Patzek model (Proc Natl Acad Sci 11:19731–19736, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313380110 , 2013) as the reduced-order model to generate synthetic production data and supplement this data with synthetic production data obtained from high-fidelity discrete fracture network simulations of the site of interest. Our results demonstrate that training with low-fidelity models is not sufficient for accurate forecasting, but transfer learning is able to augment the knowledge and perform well once trained with the small set of results from the high-fidelity model. Such a physics-informed machine-learning (PIML) workflow, grounded in physics, is a viable candidate for real-time history matching and production forecasting in a fractured shale gas reservoir.",Crossref,100.0,10.1038/s41598-021-01023-w,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-01023-w,2021.0,Goal 4,0.0227285801121395,False,

The analysis of this abundant data using statistical methods and advanced machine-learning (ML) techniques can provide data-driven insights into well performance. Most predictive modeling studies have focused on the impact that different well completion and stimulation strategies have on well production but have not fully exploited the available in situ rock property data to determine its role in reservoir productivity. We have used machine-learning techniques to rank rock mechanical properties, microseismic attributes, and stimulation parameters in the order of their significance for predicting natural gas production from an unconventional reservoir. The data for this study came from a hydraulically fractured well in the Marcellus Shale in Monongalia County, West Virginia. The data classes included measurements aggregated by well completion stage that included (1) gas production, (2) well-log-derived measurements including bulk density, elastic moduli, shear impedance, compressional impedance, brittleness, and gamma measurements, (3) microseismic attributes, (4) long-period long-duration (LPLD) event counts, (5) fracture counts, and (6) stimulation parameters that included the fluid injection volume and average pumping pressure. To identify observable proxies for the drivers of gas production, we evaluated five commonly used ML approaches including multivariate adaptive regression spline, Gaussian mixture model, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural network. We selected five variables including LPLD event count, seismogenic b-value, hydraulic diffusivity, cumulative moment, and fluid volume as the features most likely to impact gas productivity at the stage level in the study area. The data-driven selection of these parameters for their importance in determining gas production can help reservoir engineers design more effective hydraulic-fracture treatments in the Marcellus Shale and other similar unconventional reservoirs.

Geomechanical facies and preexisting fractures in each stage are identified based on similarities in formation characteristics to optimize the locations of perforation clusters. This often requires analyzing large volumes of drilling, Logging While Drilling (LWD) and Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data. In this paper, we develop a methodology that calculates the mechanical specific energy (MSE) using real-time drill string acceleration signals directly from its definition. High resolution vibration signals have been collected using a tri-axial accerlometer, which was an auxiliary tool included in acoustic borehole imager. This technique provides a cost-efficient solution for engineered completion design. Furthermore, we adopt deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with signal processing to build a data pipeline that effectively extracts patterns from dynamic acceleration signals for rock lateral MSE classification. First, we apply discrete wavelet transform and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) for signal denoising and pattern recognition. Then we construct an image dataset using multi-scale image fusion at pixel level from 3 sensor channels, including axial, lateral acceleration spectrograms and zero-padded revolutions per minute (RPM).

This white paper presents in a comprehensive way the current development state of a validation method for safety performance, with the aim of safely introducing automated driving systems to the market. As part of the validation method, the white paper proposes thirty highway scenarios that should be used to validate automated driving. The scenarios are defined by combining the road geometry (main road; marge; branch; ramp), the ego vehicle behaviour (lane keep; lane change) and the surrounding environment or behaviour of other vehicles (Cut In; Cut out; Acceleration; Deceleration; synchronic behaviour). The objective of this research is to define the important parameters regarding the behaviour of the ego vehicle in relation to the opponent vehicle, in addition to several geometric and physical parameters needed for the analysis. Methodology Based on police recorded accident data, the Fraunhofer IVI has developed a methodology for creating simulation files in order to recreate and obtain the pre-crash phase of these accidents. More than 8,000 cases are available in the current simulation database with around 2,000 of this are highway cases. The simulation results contain detailed trajectories for each participant involved in the accident with speed, acceleration and trajectory information. Each of the 2,000 highway accidents is assigned to one of the thirty scenario groups using a three-step database analysis. After the assignment process, parameters such as longitudinal and lateral distance, velocity and acceleration or deceleration are calculated for each accident. Subsequently, a statistical analysis is executed for each group that delivers the mean values and standard deviation for each parameter. The methodology used to obtain the important parameters for each scenario can be recreated and applied to any other database containing similar information to the database used for this study. The result of the analysis presented in this abstract is a statistical description of the highway scenarios proposed by the white paper. It allows configuring test scenarios for automated vehicles and systems with real world parameters from accident simulations based on accident data recorded by the police in Saxony. Around 2,000 reconstructed accidents are the basic data for the statistical description of thirty highway scenarios. The police recorded accidents on highways in Saxony are the basic data of this study. Therefore, using data from different topographic regions, other traffic regulations or other driver education requirements, may modify the parameters and the results of the analysis.

Household air pollution from burning solid fuels for cooking is a major burden in LMICs, but studies demonstrating associations between reductions in household air pollution and improvements in HbA1c, a biomarker of diabetes risk, are lacking. We previously reported substantial reductions in fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μm (PM2.5) and black carbon concentrations following an intervention in rural Honduras with the Justa cookstove, a wood-burning stove with an engineered combustion chamber and chimney. Objective: In a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial among 230 Honduran women using traditional wood-burning stoves at baseline, we evaluated the effect of the Justa intervention on HbA1c and characterized the longitudinal associations between air pollution exposures and HbA1c. Methods: At each of six visits over 3 y, we measured 24-h PM2.5 and black carbon concentrations, and finger-stick HbA1c levels. We used linear mixed models in intent-to-treat (condition by assigned stove type), exposure–response (using 24-h measures and modeled estimates of long-term exposures), and “per protocol” self-reported stove use analyses. Results: HbA1c was reduced for the Justa condition in comparison with the traditional stove condition, but estimates were small and not statistically significant [−0.03 percentage points, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.13, 0.07, n=1,208 observations]. A slightly stronger effect was observed when using self-reported stove use in per protocol analyses. Exposure–response analyses demonstrated positive associations between HbA1c and air pollution [e.g., HbA1c was 0.22 percentage points higher (95% CI: 0.13, 0.30) per log-unit higher long-term average personal PM2.5].

When dynamic task complexity is low, we find that performance is greatest in the hybrid tournament, followed by the repeated and then the grand tournament. In contrast, when dynamic task complexity is high, we find that performance is greatest in the repeated tournament, followed by the grand and hybrid tournaments, with similar performance in the latter two tournaments. More generally, the results of our experiment suggest that the effect of tournament horizon on performance depends on dynamic task complexity. These results can help firms make better decisions when designing their tournaments by reinforcing the need to align the tournament horizon with the task.",Crossref,100.0,10.2308/accr-51358,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51358,2015.0,Goal 6,0.001302396347931122,False,

Importantly, the effects of such evaluation outcomes can extend beyond the employee(s) directly affected, because such outcomes can be observed by other employees within the firm. The net effect of such vicarious learning as an indirect control depends on the inferences employees make after observing a peer's evaluation outcome. In this study, we use an experiment to investigate whether the inferences observer-employees make about how managers evaluate and reward employee behavior depend on whether the valence of the observed outcome is positive or negative. Using the setting of a strategic performance measurement system, we test and find support for a causal model, in which the valence of the observed outcome influences observer-employees' inferences and subsequent behavioral focus via their psychological distance from, and their construal of, the observed outcome. Our results suggest that how observer-employees respond after observing a peer employee's evaluation outcome is asymmetric. Specifically, when contemplating their own behavior, employees who observe positive outcomes focus on the performance measures within the strategic performance measurement system, whereas those who observe negative outcomes focus on the underlying strategic construct.",Crossref,92.5,10.2308/accr-51293,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51293,2015.0,Goal 4,0.006146016152826073,False,

The inherently serial nature of traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods imposes limitations on their efficiency and scalability. In recent years, there has been a surge of research activity devoted to developing alternative implementation methods that target parallel computing environments. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), also known as a particle filter, has been gaining popularity due to its desirable properties. SMC uses a genetic mutation-selection sampling approach with a set of particles representing the posterior distribution of a stochastic process. We propose to enhance the performance of SMC by utilizing Hamiltonian transition dynamics in the particle transition phase, in place of random walk used in the previous literature. We call the resulting procedure Hamiltonian Sequential Monte Carlo (HSMC). Hamiltonian transition dynamics have been shown to yield superior mixing and convergence properties relative to random walk transition dynamics in the context of MCMC procedures. The rationale behind HSMC is to translate such gains to the SMC environment. HSMC will facilitate practical estimation of models with complicated latent structures, such as nonparametric individual unobserved heterogeneity, that are otherwise difficult to implement. We demonstrate the behavior of HSMC in a challenging simulation study and contrast its favorable performance with SMC and other alternative approaches. We then apply HSMC to a panel discrete choice model with nonparametric consumer heterogeneity, allowing for multiple modes, asymmetries, and data-driven clustering, providing insights for consumer segmentation, individual level marketing, and price micromanagement.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1080/07474938.2022.2140982,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94d5c45105dac3fb4bff85ab65812b0f374da5cf,2023.0,Goal 9,0.008545968068122599,False,

The compact nature of globular clusters means that they are hard to spatially resolve and thus study outside the Local Group. 
In this work we have examined how well EGCs will be detectable in images from the telescope, using both simulated pre-launch images and the first early-release observations of the Fornax galaxy cluster. The Euclid Wide Survey will provide high-spatial resolution VIS imaging in the broad band as well as near-infrared photometry ( and We estimate that the 24 719 known galaxies within 100 Mpc in the footprint of the survey host around 830 000 EGCs of which about 350 000 are within the survey's detection limits. For about half of these EGCs, three infrared colours will be available as well. For any galaxy within 50 Mpc the brighter half of its GC luminosity function will be detectable by the Euclid Wide Survey. The detectability of EGCs is mainly driven by the residual surface brightness of their host galaxy. We find that an automated machine-learning EGC-classification method based on real data of the Fornax galaxy cluster provides an efficient method to generate high purity and high completeness GC candidate catalogues. We confirm that EGCs are spatially resolved compared to pure point sources in VIS images of Fornax.

Because a firm's technological investments in nascent industries typically occur before market entry, this study makes a distinction between firm capabilities at the time of market entry and at the time of initial investment. At the time of market entry, core technical capabilities and complementary assets influence the likelihood of entry. However, at the time of investment, a firm's integrative capabilities as well as the initial stocks of related technical capabilities and complementary assets become critical, as they enable endogenous development of core technical capabilities and complementary assets by the time of entry. The empirical sample consists of firms involved in field experiments in agricultural biotechnology during the period 1980–2010 . Managerial summary : New product commercialization in a nascent industry typically requires access to not only core technologies of the focal industry, but also supporting commercialization assets. However, firms may not possess these critical capabilities when they first invest in the industry. Instead, empirical evidence from the context of agricultural biotechnology shows that at the time of first investment, a firm's integrative capabilities partly explain their likelihood of entry. Integrative capabilities encompass a set of practices that enable effective coordination and communication, and in turn put firms in an advantageous position to develop the needed capabilities by the time of entry .

However, some work in linguistics implies that the use of vague language can have positive impacts if the speaker understands the needs of the audience. This study explores the use of vague language and its relationship with investor interest as well as how it interacts with the skills of the entrepreneurial founding team.

We analyze a unique survey dataset to examine the heterogeneity in the firms' actual use of NCAs conditional on industry and state.

Researchers disagree, however, on how to interpret this relationship, and in which contexts. A traditional argument is that work experience in small firms facilitates the acquisition of knowledge relevant to entrepreneurship, which, in turn, facilitates transitions into entrepreneurship. An alternative explanation argues that, at least in technical domains, the small firm effect derives from the potential for large firms to better integrate ideas internally (i.e., intrapreneurship). We inform this debate by leveraging a unique, nationally representative survey that provides rich details about the emergence of entrepreneurial ideas and their potential implementation inside vs. outside of firms. Consistent with the former explanation of the small firm effect, for the average worker, we find strong evidence that small firms (relative to large firms) are better at providing an environment that facilitates transitions to entrepreneurship. However, we also find that technical workers are more likely to attempt to implement ideas in larger firms relative to non-tech workers. Our results thus imply that while the traditional mechanism drives the small firm effect for non-tech workers, both mechanisms contribute to the effect for the tech workers, thus helping to reconcile competing explanations in prior studies. In addition to unpacking the drivers of the small firm effect, our study has broader implications for the recent discussion on the drivers of entrepreneurial dynamism.",Crossref,90.47619047619048,10.1093/icc/dtad024,https://doi.org/10.1093/icc/dtad024,2023.0,Goal 9,0.01848876482260589,False,industry; small-scale enterprises

We argue that the direct network effects of complementors' products play a central role in the platform management by its owner. We test our predictions using data on the Apple's promotion of apps. We find that apps with network effects are more likely to receive an award. This likelihood increases when the app is introduced by a developer with a larger market share but declines when introduced in a concentrated segment. The likelihood decreases further if the app is introduced in a concentrated segment by a developer that holds a larger market share. Further, we observe that in concentrated segments, the “challenger” developer has a higher likelihood of receiving the award relative to the leader. Managerial Summary Many products offered through platforms have their own direct network effects. The value of the product for each user grows with the number of other consumers using the product. Many platform owners also actively manage their platforms to ensure platform growth and often use less traditional tools such as product endorsements to achieve this goal. In the context of video games listed in the iOS App Store and the Editors' Choice Awards as a form of product endorsement, we examine the tradeoffs that products with direct network effects (i.e., multiplayer video games) present to the platform owner (Apple). On the one hand, the platform owner may want to promote apps with direct network effects to help them achieve a momentum in terms of user growth. On the other hand, networked apps may become dominant in the segment with negative implications for future growth of the segment and the platform owner's profitability.

Legal challenges emerge when intellectual property (IP) safeguards are involved. We examine a firm's ability to initiate IP litigation or protect against litigation (i.e., litigation ability) as an antecedent to its technological diversification. We demonstrate that an unexpected reduction in firm's litigation ability is associated with a temporary decline in its entry into new technological domains. Furthermore, we find that the negative effect is stronger when the firm's existing inventors cannot be easily utilized in the new domain or when interfirm mobility in the new domain is low. These findings extend prior work by highlighting a proactive role of the firm's litigation ability that spans beyond protecting the firm's existing IP.

However, these inventors may come from competitors and their knowledge may be protected by IP safeguards.

We examine the role of prior industry experience in the startups' next stage—its hiring of new employees. We tackle two empirical challenges—the mutual aspect of hiring and the effect of unobserved variables on employees' earnings using a two‐sided matching model. Our results reveal that even firms founded by entrepreneurs without industry experience can attract new employees with such experience if the founders start with a large entrepreneurial team. Further, startups provide new hires with an earnings premium for their industry experience. Our approach illustrates the benefits of matching models over traditional regressions. Managerial summary Growing startups face the question of who to hire and how much to compensate the new hires. Simultaneously, prospective new hires ask which startup to join and how much their salary will be. We explore these questions using a novel method that tackles the mutual selection process. In the context of five technological manufacturing industries, we find that having industry experience within founding teams may not be necessary to attract new hires with high quality if the startup can signal its own quality through other means such as having a larger founding team.

We develop a theory suggesting that spinout founders hiring from their prior firm versus hiring from the external labor market to assemble spinout teams will have differential effects on spinout survival. Using confidential employee–employer linked data in the legal services industry provided by the United States Census Bureau, we find evidence that inclusion of spinout team members from the founder's prior firm is positively related to spinout survival, a relationship which increases with included members' prior earnings. In contrast, we find that inclusion of spinout team members from firms outside the founder's prior firm is positively associated with spinout failure, a relationship which becomes statistically insignificant when included team members' prior earnings are high. Taken together, our results point to the potential hazards associated with using external markets to assemble spinout teams, thereby establishing an important boundary condition for extant theory which has focused on the benefits associated with spinout team size, but has often neglected the labor market strategy through which such teams are assembled.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1108/s0742-332220200000041026,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e36e07b3e7d33d5626221df8444621ef83deb5a4,2020.0,Goal 10,0.009544195461362622,False,

We seek to examine whether investors in high-stakes equity crowdfunding, which includes elements from both traditional equity financing and low-stakes crowdfunding, respond differently to male and female founders. Specifically, we examine whether founder gender preferences, if they exist, vary based on the gender and the experience of the investor. Through a randomized field experiment, we find that inexperienced female investors are significantly more interested (138%) in ventures with female founders than those with male founders; however, we do not observe founder gender preferences among experienced female investors. For male investors, we do not observe differences in interest based on founder gender or investor experience. Thus, we confirm that the gender gaps observed in traditional equity financing are ameliorated in the equity crowdfunding context. Furthermore, we identify a boundary condition to the preference for female founders reported in earlier work involving low-stakes crowdfunding. In high-stakes crowdfunding, investor experience serves as a contingency that reduces female investors’ preference for female founders, potentially because of the weakening effects of activism homophily and the lower reliance on heuristics as investor experience increases.

Drawing on the unfolding model of voluntary turnover, we develop a theory proposing that positive shocks to external relational capital will catalyze employees to consider alternative employment options, thereby increasing the probability of exit. We further maintain that exit decisions in response to such shocks will be driven by a desire to appropriate more value, making these shocks strong predictors of employee entrepreneurship, especially when the employee works in an area that is peripheral to the firm’s core capabilities. Empirically, we construct a unique employee-employer linked database that tracks employment of lobbyists in the United States federal lobbying industry. Leveraging plausibly exogenous shocks to the value of an employee’s relational capital and a novel market-based measure of the employee’s position in the firm’s knowledge space, we report two sets of findings. First, an increase in the value of relational capital has a positive effect on the likelihood of mobility to established firms and employee entrepreneurship, with the effect for the latter stronger than the former. Second, the magnitude of the effect on employee entrepreneurship becomes stronger when the employee is peripheral to the firm’s core knowledge. Together, our results are consistent with a value creation-value appropriation rationale, where sudden increases in the value of an employee’s relational capital drive exit as a means to appropriate a greater portion of value created.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/orsc.2018.1262,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2018.1262,2019.0,Goal 8,0.02855367358930808,False,entrepreneurship

Empirically, we demonstrate that when cross‐industry frictions in the form of limited skill transferability and within‐industry frictions in the form of noncompete enforceability are both present, employees exhibit longer tenures, firms hire workers with less initial experience, firms change the amount and nature of training provided, and wages marginally increase. These findings suggest that sufficiently strong and complementary mobility frictions shift the emphasis of firms’ human capital management practices toward internal development of human capital relative to acquisition on the external market. Managerial Summary : In the face of frictions to employee mobility both within and across industries, which we capture empirically using measures of noncompete enforceability and limited skill transferability across industries, firms tend to hire less experienced workers, such workers exhibit longer tenures, and firms invest more in their training, particularly in the development of new skills. Our findings imply that for firms operating under such complementary frictions, better hiring and internal development capabilities are particularly important for performance, while those firms without such capabilities may benefit from considering ways to circumvent the mobility frictions, including moving out of the focal state or lobbying for different noncompete laws.",Crossref,100.0,10.1002/smj.2906,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2906,2018.0,Goal 16,0.01788652119227652,False,

Although institutional factors like non‐compete regimes shape intra‐industry mobility patterns, far less is known about firm‐specific reputations built through patent enforcement. This study formally models and empirically tests how a firm's prior litigiousness over patents (i.e., its reputation for IP toughness) influences employee mobility. Based on inventor data from the U.S . semiconductor industry, we find that litigiousness not only diminishes the proclivity of inventive workers to “job hop” to others in the industry, it also shifts the distribution of talent released to the market.

Some researchers propose that the transition to entrepreneurship may be explained by established firms undervaluing knowledge created by employees, whereas other scholars maintain that firm strategies may lead to the underutilization of knowledge. We ask the question of which of these drivers is more pronounced as an explanation of employee entrepreneurship and what technological factors matter in this relationship. Analyzing a unique data set, we find that the likelihood of employee entrepreneurship increases with the inventor’s assessment of the value of a patent for an invention developed while at the incumbent firm but dramatically decreases when the invention protected by the patent is commercialized by the firm, licensed to third parties, interdependent with other firms’ inventions protected by patents, or technologically broad. We also find that conditional on high valuation by the inventor, a matching high valuation by the firm further increases the likelihood of transitioning to entrepreneurship. In combination, we show that a situation when both the inventor and the firm consider the invention valuable but the firm ends up not commercializing the invention is more predictive of employee entrepreneurship than simple differences in assessing the value of the invention.

Methods Between 2011 and 2016, 14 481 US adults who used paracetamol in the preceding 30 days were sampled from national online panels and completed a detailed online daily diary of paracetamol medication use for 7 days. Respondents were not told that the study concerned paracetamol. Cold/flu season (CFS), identified using Google Trends data, was contrasted to off‐season in symptoms, use of paracetamol medications, and consumption exceeding 4 g (the recommended daily maximum). Results Overall, 6.3% [95% confidence interval: 5.9–6.7%] of users exceeded 4 g on at least one day; 3.7% [3.5–3.8%] of usage days exceeded 4 g. Cold/flu symptoms were more likely to be experienced and treated with paracetamol in CFS than off‐season.

Respondents were not told the study concerned acetaminophen. Total daily intake was calculated from diary data. Generalized estimating equations assessed the association of medication patterns with exceeding 4 g per day among 3618 respondents who used acetaminophen medications (on 13 852 days) during the diary period. Results Acetaminophen intake exceeded 4 g on 3.1% of usage days; median intake on those days was 5.5 g. As expected, days when intake exceeded 4 g were almost always (92%) marked by deviations from label directions—exceeding the one‐time dose, re‐dosing too soon, and concomitant use of multiple acetaminophen medications. Re‐dosing too soon was the most frequent deviation, and concomitant use was most strongly tied to exceeding the daily limit. Use of both an Rx and an OTC medication on the same day also increased the odds of exceeding 4 g on days when concomitant use occurred. Conclusions Excess dosing of acetaminophen is associated with deviations from label directions and by use of both OTC and Rx medications containing acetaminophen within a single concomitant use day.

British Journal of Pharmacology. doi:10.1111/bph.15423",2021,"Olona, (2021) Cardiac glycosides cause cytotoxicity in human macrophages and ameliorate white adipose tissue homeostasis","Background and Purpose Cardiac glycosides inhibit Na + /K + ‐ATPase and are used to treat heart failure and arrhythmias. They can induce inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in macrophages, suggesting cytotoxicity, which remains to be elucidated in human tissues. Experimental Approach To determine the cell‐type specificity of this cytotoxicity, we used human monocyte‐derived macrophages and non‐adherent peripheral blood cells from healthy donors, plus omental white adipose tissue, stromal vascular fraction‐derived pre‐adipocytes and adipocytes from obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. All these cells/tissues were treated with nanomolar concentrations of ouabain (50, 100, 500 nM) to investigate the level of cytotoxicity and the mechanisms leading to cell death. In white adipose tissue, we investigated ouabain‐mediated cytotoxicity by measuring insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue function and extracellular matrix deposition ex vivo . Key Results Ouabain induced cell death through pyroptosis and apoptosis, and was more effective in monocyte‐derived macrophages compared to non‐adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations. This cytotoxicity is dependent on K + flux, as ouabain causes intracellular depletion of K + and accumulation of Na + and Ca 2+ . Consistently, the cell death caused by these ion imbalances can be rescued by addition of potassium chloride to human monocyte‐derived macrophages. Remarkably, when white adipose tissue explants from obese patients are cultured with nanomolar concentrations of ouabain, this causes depletion of macrophages, down‐regulation of type VI collagen levels and amelioration of insulin sensitivity ex vivo . Conclusion and Implications The use of nanomolar concentration of cardiac glycosides could be an attractive therapeutic treatment for metabolic syndrome, characterized by pathogenic infiltration and activation of macrophages.

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",Crossref,100.0,10.1093/med/9780198746690.003.0575,https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198746690.003.0575,2020.0,Goal 1,0.01481559909463373,False,

To date, genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing approaches have provided limited insights into the mechanisms of acquired brain injury. We have previously reported a pro-epileptic gene network, which is conserved across species, encoding inflammatory processes and positively regulated by sestrin3 (SESN3). In this study, we investigated the phenotype of SESN3 knock-out rats in terms of susceptibility to seizures and observed a significant delay in status epilepticus onset in SESN3 knock-out compared to control rats. This finding confirms previous in vitro and in vivo evidence indicating that SESN3 may favour occurrence and/or severity of seizures. We also analysed the phenotype of SESN3 knock-out rats for common comorbidities of epilepsy, i.e., anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment.

No genetic markers for resistance to individual antiseizure medication (ASM) have yet been identified. We aimed to identify the role of rare genetic variants in drug resistance for three common ASMs: levetiracetam (LEV), lamotrigine (LTG), and valproic acid (VPA). Methods A cohort of 1622 individuals of European descent with epilepsy was deeply phenotyped and underwent whole exome sequencing (WES), comprising 575 taking LEV, 826 LTG, and 782 VPA. We performed gene‐ and gene set–based collapsing analyses comparing responders and nonresponders to the three drugs to determine the burden of different categories of rare genetic variants. Results We observed a marginally significant enrichment of rare missense, truncating, and splice region variants in individuals who were resistant to VPA compared to VPA responders for genes involved in VPA pharmacokinetics. We also found a borderline significant enrichment of truncating and splice region variants in the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein ( SV2 ) gene family in nonresponders compared to responders to LEV. We did not see any significant enrichment using a gene‐based approach. Significance In our pharmacogenetic study, we identified a slightly increased burden of damaging variants in gene groups related to drug kinetics or targeting in individuals presenting with drug resistance to VPA or LEV.

Methods People with JME were identified from a large database of individuals with epilepsy, which includes detailed retrospective information on AED use. We assessed secular changes in AED use and calculated rates of response (12‐month seizure freedom) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for the five most common AEDs. Retention was modeled with a Cox proportional hazards model. We compared valproate use between males and females. Results We included 305 people with 688 AED trials of valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, and topiramate. Valproate and carbamazepine were most often prescribed as the first AED. The response rate to valproate was highest among the five AEDs (42.7%), and significantly higher than response rates for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and topiramate; the difference to the response rate to levetiracetam (37.1%) was not significant. The rates of ADRs were highest for topiramate (45.5%) and valproate (37.5%). Commonest ADRs included weight change, lethargy, and tremor. In the Cox proportional hazards model, later start year (1.10 [1.08‐1.13], P P = 0.02) were associated with shorter trial duration.

To identify the shared and distinct ultra-rare genetic risk factors for rare and common epilepsies, we performed a whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis of 9,170 epilepsy-affected individuals and 8,364 controls of European ancestry. We focused on three phenotypic groups; the rare but severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE), and the commoner phenotypes of genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) and non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE). We observed that compared to controls, individuals with any type of epilepsy carried an excess of ultra-rare, deleterious variants in constrained genes and in genes previously associated with epilepsy, with the strongest enrichment seen in DEE and the least in NAFE. Moreover, we found that inhibitory GABAA receptor genes were enriched for missense variants across all three classes of epilepsy, while no enrichment was seen in excitatory receptor genes. The larger gene groups for the GABAergic pathway or cation channels also showed a significant mutational burden in DEE and GGE. Although no single gene surpassed exome-wide significance among individuals with GGE or NAFE, highly constrained genes and genes encoding ion channels were among the top associations, including CACNA1G, EEF1A2, and GABRG2 for GGE and LGI1, TRIM3, and GABRG2 for NAFE.

In nearly 30% of these cases, epilepsy cannot be properly controlled by antiepileptic drugs. More importantly, treatments to prevent or modify epileptogenesis do not exist. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently needed. In this respect, it is important to identify which patients will develop epilepsy and which individually tailored treatment is needed. However, currently, we have no tools to identify the patients at risk, and diagnosis of epileptogenesis remains as a major unmet medical need, which relates to lack of diagnostic biomarkers for epileptogenesis. As the epileptogenic process in humans is typically slow, the use of animal models is justified to speed up biomarker discovery. We aim to summarize recommendations for molecular biomarker research and propose a standardized procedure for biomarker discovery in rat models of epileptogenesis. The potential of many phylogenetically conserved circulating noncoding small RNA s, including micro RNA s (mi RNA s), as biomarkers has been explored in various brain diseases, including epilepsy. Recent studies show the feasibility of detecting mi RNA s in blood in both experimental models and human epilepsy. However, the analysis of circulating mi RNA s in rodent models is challenging, which relates both to the lack of standardized sampling protocols and to analysis of mi RNA s. We will discuss the issues critical for preclinical plasma biomarker discovery, such as documentation, blood and brain tissue sampling and collection, plasma separation and storage, RNA extraction, quality control, and RNA detection. We propose a protocol for standardization of procedures for discovery of circulating mi RNA biomarkers in rat models of epileptogenesis.

We identified a co-expression network of 320 genes (M30), which is significantly enriched for non-synonymous de novo mutations ascertained from patients with monogenic epilepsy and for common variants associated with polygenic epilepsy. The genes in the M30 network are expressed widely in the human brain under tight developmental control and encode physically interacting proteins involved in synaptic processes.

Analysis of M30 expression revealed consistent downregulation in the epileptic brain in heterogeneous forms of epilepsy including human temporal lobe epilepsy, a mouse model of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy, and a mouse model of monogenic Dravet (SCN1A) disease. These results suggest functional disruption of M30 via gene mutation or altered expression as a convergent mechanism regulating susceptibility to epilepsy broadly.

Sixty-three miRNAs were differentially expressed in the GCL when considering all time points. Three main clusters were identified that separated the control and chronic phase groups from the latency group and from the first spontaneous seizure group. MiRNAs from rats in the chronic phase were compared to those obtained from the laser-microdissected GCL of epileptic patients, identifying several miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-23a-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-181c-5p) that were up-regulated in both human and rat epileptic tissue. Analysis of plasma samples revealed different levels between control and pilocarpine-treated animals for 27 miRNAs. Two main clusters were identified that segregated controls from all other groups.

Here we employ systems genetics approaches to characterize the genetic regulation of pathophysiological pathways in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Using surgically acquired hippocampi from 129 TLE patients, we identify a gene-regulatory network genetically associated with epilepsy that contains a specialized, highly expressed transcriptional module encoding proconvulsive cytokines and Toll-like receptor signalling genes. RNA sequencing analysis in a mouse model of TLE using 100 epileptic and 100 control hippocampi shows the proconvulsive module is preserved across-species, specific to the epileptic hippocampus and upregulated in chronic epilepsy. In the TLE patients, we map the trans-acting genetic control of this proconvulsive module to Sestrin 3 (SESN3), and demonstrate that SESN3 positively regulates the module in macrophages, microglia and neurons. Morpholino-mediated Sesn3 knockdown in zebrafish confirms the regulation of the transcriptional module, and attenuates chemically induced behavioural seizures in vivo.

Past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type two, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, bladder cancer and ex-smoking. Pulmonary artery (PA) aneurysm of 50 mm was previously incidentally identified on CT chest in 2017, however this was conservatively managed as pulmonary arterial pressures were normal on subsequent echocardiogram. The patient presented to the emergency department with central crushing chest pain radiating to the arms, associated with breathlessness. There were no signs of acute heart failure. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with a rate of 90 bpm with no signs of acute ischaemia or structural abnormality. Initial laboratory investigations identified a raised troponin of 42 ng/L (<16 ng/L) and a CRP of 5.3 mg/L (<5.0 mg/L). Sublingual nitrates provided minimal relief. Urgent coronary angiography identified an extrinsic compression of the LMCA, confirmed with marked systolic luminal flattening on intravenous ultrasound (IVUS) to a minimum luminal area of just 6 mm, as seen in Fig. 1. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) angiography demonstrated a pulmonary trunk aneurysm with a diameter of 55 mm, extending from the pulmonary valve to the bifurcation of the left and right pulmonary arteries, causing severe compression of the LMCA, also in Fig. 1. The patient underwent urgent pulmonary trunk aneurysm repair and pulmonary valve replacement. A 29 mm FreestyleTM Bioroot was secured into the right ventricular outflow tract after resection of the pulmonary valve leaflets. The Freestyle graft was long enough to replace the main PA in its entirety, from the pulmonary valve to the bifurcation. The anterior two-thirds of the proximal anastomosis were augmented with a bovine pericardial patch to prevent kinking of the main pulmonary trunk. The left anterior descending coronary artery was also bypassed with a length of great saphenous vein. Intraoperative findings are detailed in Fig. 2. A post-procedure transoesophageal echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, a competent bioprosthetic pulmonary valve and a PA pressure of 30/15 mmHg. The patient’s postoperative course was complicated by labile blood glucose levels and poor mobility. She was discharged home after 14 days. A sample of pulmonary artery was provided for histopathology which identified multinucleated giant cells alongside scattered histiocytes and lymphocytes in keeping with giant cell arteritis (GCA).

Limited previous studies have found post-CABG pleural effusion to be associated with increased length-of-stay and greater morbidity post-CABG. Despite this the associations of this common complication are poorly described. This study sought to identify modifiable risk factors for effusion post-CABG. Methods A retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data assessed patients who underwent CABG over two-years. Data was collected for risk factors and sequelae related to pleural effusion requiring drainage. Results A total of 409 patients were included. Average age was 64.9±10.2 years, 330 (80.7%) were male. 59 (14.4%) patients underwent drainage of pleural effusion post-CABG. Effusions were drained on average 9.9±8.4 days post-CABG. Earlier removal of drain tubes and removal near time of extubation were associated with development of pleural effusion. Post-CABG pleural effusion was associated with post-operative renal impairment (P<0.01) and pericardial effusion (P<0.01). Patients with pleural effusion were more likely to require readmission to ICU (P<0.01), reintubation (P=0.03) and readmission to hospital (P=0.03).

At present, the optimal management strategy for chronic type B aortic dissection (CTBAD) remains unknown, as equipoise remains regarding medical management versus endovascular treatment versus open surgery. However, the results over recent years of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in CTBAD appear promising. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the available data reporting outcomes and survival rates for TEVAR in CTBAD.


Methods
Electronic searches of six databases were performed from inception to April 2021. All studies reporting outcomes, specifically 30-day mortality rates, for endovascular repair of CTBAD were identified. Relevant data were extracted, and a random-effects meta-analysis of proportions or means was performed to aggregate the data. Survival data were pooled using data derived from original Kaplan-Meier curves, which allows reconstruction of individual patient data.


Results
Forty-eight studies with 2,641 patients were identified. Early (<30 days) all-cause and aortic-related mortality rates were low at 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Incidence of retrograde type A dissection in the post-operative period was only 1.4%. There were also low rates of cerebrovascular accidents and spinal cord injury (1.1% and 0.9%, respectively). Late follow-up all-cause mortality was 8.0%, however, late aortic-related mortality was only 2.4%. Reintervention rates were 10.1% for endovascular and 6.7% for surgical reintervention. Pooled rates of overall survival at 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year were 91.5%, 84.7%, 77.7% and 56.3%, respectively.


Conclusions
The significant heterogeneity in the available evidence and absence of consensus reporting standards are important considerations and concern when interpreting the data. Evaluation of the evidence suggests that TEVAR for CTBAD is a safe procedure with low rates of complications. However, the optimal treatment strategy for CTBAD remains debatable and requires further research.

Results Incidence of IHRs within Australia decreased from 217 to 194 per 100 000 population over the 15‐year study period. There was a clear shift towards increased uptake of laparoscopic surgery with a subsequent fall in rates of open IHRs. Males accounted for the majority of IHR procedures. Unilateral repair was more common; however, the incidence of unilateral repair rates decreased while bilateral IHR rates increased over the study period. Conclusion Laparoscopic techniques are increasingly being used within public and private institutions across the country for inguinal hernia repair. There has also been a decrease in the incidence of IHR procedures performed per year over the 15‐year period studied, consistent with published literature from Europe and the USA.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/ans.16192,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16192,2020.0,Goal 17,0.02679141974975867,False,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect size of preterm birth on cardiac remodeling from birth to young adulthood. DATA SOURCES: Data sources include Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane databases, and clinical trial registries (inception to March 25, 2020). STUDY SELECTION: Studies in which cardiac phenotype was compared between preterm individuals born at &lt;37 weeks’ gestation and age-matched term controls were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Random-effects models were used to calculate weighted mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Thirty-two observational studies were included (preterm = 1471; term = 1665). All measures of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic function were lower in preterm neonates, including LV ejection fraction (P = .01). Preterm LV ejection fraction was similar from infancy, although LV stroke volume index was lower in young adulthood. Preterm LV peak early diastolic tissue velocity was lower throughout development, although preterm diastolic function worsened with higher estimated filling pressures from infancy. RV longitudinal strain was lower in preterm-born individuals of all ages, proportional to the degree of prematurity (R2 = 0.64; P = .002). Preterm-born individuals had persistently smaller LV internal dimensions, lower indexed LV end-diastolic volume in young adulthood, and an increase in indexed LV mass, compared with controls, of 0.71 g/m2 per year from childhood (P = .007). LIMITATIONS: The influence of preterm-related complications on cardiac phenotype could not be fully explored. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm-born individuals have morphologic and functional cardiac impairments across developmental stages. These changes may make the preterm heart more vulnerable to secondary insults, potentially underlying their increased risk of early heart failure.",Crossref,100.0,10.1542/peds.2020-0146,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-0146,2020.0,Goal 1,0.01113413144910963,False,

The treatment of aortic valve disease is the most common valvular surgery in industrialized nations, with 3-9% of the population over the age of eighty having at least moderate aortic stenosis. As transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become more established, newer surgical prostheses have been developed with a variety of anchoring systems that do not rely solely on sutures to hold the valve in an appropriate position. The Edwards Intuity valve is a bovine pericardial prosthesis that is modelled on the widely implanted Perimount MagnaEase aortic prosthesis. The Perceval valve is a bovine pericardial valve attached to a self-expanding nitinol stent, which uses the radial force exerted on the patient's aortic annulus and aortic root by the stent portion to hold the valve in position. This meta-analysis compares the outcomes of comparative studies of these two valve systems.


Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis compares the outcomes of rapid deployment valves (RDV) and sutureless valves (SURD) and was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations and guidance. The search strategy interrogated six electronic databases. Outcomes measured included all-cause mortality at latest follow up, stroke, cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times, pacemaker implantation rates, paravalvular leak and post-operative transvalvular gradient.


Results
The search strategy identified 407 unique papers for initial assessment with seven studies qualifying for inclusion in the analysis. The outcomes of 4,076 patients (1,650 RDV, 2,426 SURD) were included. There was no difference in mortality, stroke or moderate or worse paravalvular regurgitation between the two groups. SURD had significantly shorter CPB time by 15.7 minutes [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2-27.1; P=0.007] and a shorter cross-clamp time by 11.3 minutes (95% CI: 6.3-16.3; P<0.001) compared to RDV. RDV had a lower post-operative transvalvular gradient by 2.5 mmHg (95% CI: 1.2-3.8; P<0.001) and a lower rate of mild paravalvular regurgitation (OR 2.51; 95% CI: 1.435-4.768; P=0.004).


Conclusions
Both valve types have an adequate safety profile and are comparable to conventional sutured prostheses. There was a significant reduction in cross-clamp and CPB times associated with SURD. This may be of benefit for patients requiring multiple concomitant procedures and increases the utility of minimally invasive valve replacement. However, SURD was associated with higher post-operative transvalvular gradients and a higher incidence of paravalvular regurgitation.",Semantic Scholar,28.14814814814815,10.21037/ACS-2020-SURD-27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f85dc27e387edf8586857d0d82e61164c9cf6256,2020.0,Goal 3,0.01415199154084007,False,

We examine the prevalence of pain, fatigue, and emotional distress among patients with cancer, as well as patient perceptions of the symptom care they received. PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventeen Commission on Cancer–accredited cancer centers across the United States sampled patients with local/regional breast (82%) or colon (18%) cancer. We received 2,487 completed surveys (61% response rate). RESULTS Of patients, 76%, 78%, and 59% reported talking to a clinician about pain, fatigue, and distress, respectively, and 70%, 61%, and 54% reported receiving advice. Sixty-one percent of patients experienced pain, 74% fatigue, and 46% distress. Among those patients experiencing each symptom, 58% reported getting the help they wanted for pain, 40% for fatigue, and 45% for distress. Multilevel logistic regression models revealed that patients experiencing symptoms were significantly more likely to have talked about and received advice on coping with these symptoms. In addition, patients who were receiving or recently completed curative treatment reported more symptoms and better symptom care than did those who were further in time from curative treatment. CONCLUSION In our sample, 30% to 50% of patients with cancer in community cancer centers did not report discussing, getting advice, or receiving desired help for pain, fatigue, or emotional distress. This finding suggests that there is room for improvement in the management of these three common cancer-related symptoms. Higher proportions of talk and advice among those experiencing symptoms imply that many discussions may be patient initiated. Lower rates of talk and advice among those who are further in time from treatment suggest the need for more assessment among longer-term survivors, many of whom continue to experience these symptoms.

The workshop brought together diverse stakeholders (patients, advocates, academicians, clinicians, research funders, and policymakers) to review progress and ongoing challenges since the Institute of Medicine (IOM)’s seminal report on the subject of adult cancer survivors published in 2006. This commentary profiles the content of the meeting sessions and concludes with recommendations that stem from the workshop discussions. Although there has been progress over the past decade, many of the recommendations from the 2006 report have not been fully implemented. Obstacles related to the routine delivery of standardized physical and psychosocial care services to cancer survivors are substantial, with important gaps in care for patients and caregivers. Innovative care models for cancer survivors have emerged, and changes in accreditation requirements such as the Commission on Cancer’s (CoC) requirement for survivorship care planning have put cancer survivorship on the radar.

Health-related self-efficacy was measured with the item: “Overall, how confident are you about your ability to take good care of your health?” and the prevalence of six chronic conditions and depression/anxiety was assessed. Patient-centered communication was measured as the frequency with which respondents perceived their healthcare providers allowed them to ask questions, gave attention to their emotions, involved them in decisions, made sure they understood how to take care of their health, helped them to deal with uncertainty, and if they felt they could rely on their healthcare providers to take care of their healthcare needs.ResultsHealth-related self-efficacy was significantly lower among individuals with

A report from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium","BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to examine associations of symptoms with physical and mental health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and in patients with lung cancer. METHODS Patients with newly diagnosed CRC (n = 3040) or lung cancer (n = 2297) who were participating in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium study completed surveys on general HRQOL and symptoms. HRQOL was measured by using physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 12‐item short‐form heath survey. Nonspecific cancer symptoms were measured using items from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality‐of‐life questionnaire. Cancer type‐specific modules developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer were used to assess CRC‐specific and lung cancer‐specific symptoms. For both cancer types, linear regression models that were controlled for demographic and clinical information were used to examine correlations of nonspecific and cancer‐specific symptoms with PCS and MCS scores. RESULTS PCS scores for patients with CRC and lung cancer were below the general population norm of 50 (43 and 37, respectively), and MCS scores were at the population norm. For the CRC sample, in the model that included both symptom indices, an increase in nonspecific symptoms was more strongly associated with lower PCS and MCS scores than an increase in CRC‐specific symptoms (PCS, standardized coefficient [β] = −0.41 vs −0.09; MCS, β = −0.38 vs −0.08). In a similar model for lung cancer, increases in lung cancer‐specific symptoms were more strongly associated with lower PCS scores (β = −0.34 vs −0.20), whereas nonspecific symptoms were more strongly associated with lower MCS scores (β = −0.34 vs −0.14). CONCLUSIONS Symptoms were associated with HRQOL impairments in recently diagnosed patients.

Rates of disclosure of CHAs are variable and may be facilitated by patient‐centered communication. METHODS This cross‐sectional study conducted in 2003‐2004 examined a population‐based sample of leukemia, colorectal, and bladder cancer survivors (n=623) who were 2 to 5 years after their diagnosis. A subset of participants who reported using CHAs (n=196) was analyzed with multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between patients' perceptions of their physician's patient‐centered communication (ie, information exchange, affective behavior, knowledge of patients as persons) and patients' disclosure of CHA use to their physician with adjustments for physician, patient, and patient‐physician relationship factors. RESULTS Thirty‐one percent of the full sample used CHAs, and 47.6% of CHA users disclosed their use to their physicians. Disclosure was significantly associated with patient‐centered communication even with adjustments for hypothesized covariates (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09‐1.71). Perceived physician knowledge of the patient as a person (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10‐1.48) and information exchange (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02‐1.60) were the aspects of patient‐centered communication that contributed to this association. The main reason for nondisclosure assessed in the survey was that survivors did not think that it was important to discuss CHAs (67.0%). A majority of physicians encouraged continued use of CHAs when they were disclosed (64.8%).

A very high level of accuracy (99.7–102.1%) and precision (±1.5%) was achieved. Residue data generated from the illustrated application of the method showed a robust normal distribution, unlike field studies. The method is deemed to be controllable, cost-efficient, and time-saving, taking hours rather than days.

However, recent dermal absorption studies with dried residues and their respective in-use dilutions have shown that this is likely to significantly overestimate their dermal penetration potential and, thus, predicted systemic exposure. The choice of appropriate dose levels for these dermal absorption studies has not been defined. Moreover, actual skin loading during re-entry tasks may differ significantly from that achieved by applying a fixed volume of an aqueous dilution, which is the standard practice in generic dermal absorption studies. To address this, we propose an approach to dose setting for dried residue studies within the current European risk assessment framework. Skin loading for studies can be calculated from the existing exposure algorithms and by taking appropriate body surface areas into account. Thus, skin loading in studies will vary depending on the exact nature and duration of the task and the region of the body exposed, reflecting actual exposure scenarios.",Crossref,100.0,10.1093/annweh/wxaa139,https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa139,2021.0,Goal 14,0.006361347059830903,False,

Manufacturing & Service Operations Management. doi:10.1287/msom.2021.1009",2021,"Shi, (2021) The Effects of Patent Extension and Take-Back Regulation on Green Pharmacy","Problem definition: The eco-toxicity arising from unused pharmaceuticals has regulators advocating the benign design concept of “green pharmacy,” but high research and development expenses can be prohibitive. We therefore examine the impacts of two regulatory mechanisms, patent extension and take-back regulation, on inducing drug manufacturers to go green. Academic/practical relevance: One incentive suggested by the European Environmental Agency is a patent extension for a company that redesigns its already patented pharmaceutical to be more environmentally friendly. This incentive can encourage both the development of degradable drugs and the disclosure of technical information. Yet, it is unclear how effective the extension would be in inducing green pharmacy and in maximizing social welfare. Methodology: We develop a game-theoretic model in which an innovative company collects monopoly profits for a patented pharmaceutical but faces competition from a generic rival after the patent expires. A social-welfare-maximizing regulator is the Stackelberg leader. The regulator leads by offering a patent extension to the innovative company while also imposing take-back regulation on the pharmaceutical industry. Then the two-profit maximizing companies respond by setting drug prices and choosing whether to invest in green pharmacy. Results: The regulator’s optimal patent extension offer can induce green pharmacy but only if the offer exceeds a threshold length that depends on the degree of product differentiation present in the pharmaceutical industry. The regulator’s correspondingly optimal take-back regulation generally prescribes a required collection rate that decreases as its optimal patent extension offer increases, and vice versa. Managerial implications: By isolating green pharmacy as a potential target to address pharmaceutical eco-toxicity at its source, the regulatory policy that we consider, which combines the incentive inherent in earning a patent extension on the one hand with the penalty inherent in complying with take-back regulation on the other hand, serves as a useful starting point for policymakers to optimally balance economic welfare considerations with environmental stewardship considerations.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2021.1009,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.1009,2022.0,Goal 1,0.02084615725181149,False,

Academic/practical relevance: The prevalence of this noncompliance problem poses considerable public health risk, thus compromising the original purpose of a well-intentioned AP initiative. We provide an internally consistent and implementable solution to the problem through a comprehensive analysis of the myriad complicating factors and trade-offs facing the FDA. Methodology: We adopt a Stackelberg framework in which the regulator, which cannot observe the manufacturer’s private cost information or level of effort, leads by imposing a postmarket study deadline. The profit-maximizing manufacturer then follows by establishing its level of effort to invest in its postmarket study. In establishing its deadline, the regulator optimizes the trade-off between providing public access to potentially effective drugs and mitigating public health risks from ineffective drugs. Results: We develop a deadline-dependent user fee menu as a screening mechanism that establishes an incentive for manufacturer compliance. We show that its effectiveness in inducing compliance depends fundamentally on the enforceability of sanction, a drug-specific measure that indicates how difficult it is to withdraw an unproven drug from the market, and the drug’s success probability: The higher either is, the higher is the probability that the mechanism induces compliance. Managerial implications: We synthesize and distill the salient trade-offs and nuances facing the FDA’s noncompliance problem and provide an implementable solution. We quantify the value of the solution as a function of a drug’s success probability and enforceability. From a public policy perspective, we provide guidance for the FDA to increase the viability and effectiveness of AP.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.3471632,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7ecbf1fb52a0a75e0b9cd9d0eeca6a54082f320,2019.0,Goal 3,0.04387199895674479,False,

In this article, we explore this dichotomy and analyze the effect of remanufacturable product design on market segmentation and product and trade‐in prices by studying a two‐stage profit‐maximization problem in which a price‐setting manufacturer can choose whether or not to open a remanufactured‐goods market for its product. Our results suggest that it is optimal for a manufacturer to design a remanufacturable product when the value‐added from remanufacturing is relatively high but product durability is relatively low and innovation is nominal. In addition, we find that entering a remanufactured‐goods market in and of itself does not necessarily translate into environmental friendliness. On the one hand, the optimal trade‐in program could result in low return and/or remanufacturing rates. On the other hand, a low price for remanufactured products could attract higher demand and thereby potentially result in more damage to the environment. Meanwhile, external restrictions imposed on total greenhouse gas emissions draw criticism in their own right because they risk stifling growth or reducing overall consumer welfare. Given these trade‐offs, we therefore develop and compare several measures of environmental efficiency and conclude that emissions per revenue can serve as the best proxy for emissions as a metric for measuring overall environmental stewardship.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/deci.12191,https://doi.org/10.1111/deci.12191,2016.0,Goal 12,0.05438771596765304,True,environmental taxes; environmentally friendly consumption; greenhouse gas emissions; reusable products; sustainable product design

Native plant pathogens thriving in natural environments significantly contribute to ecosystem structure, stability, nutrient cycling, and productivity. The coevolution of wild crop progenitors with native pathogens yields a diverse array of disease resistance factors, serving as a critical resource for farmers and breeders in developing disease-resistant cultivars.

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, specifically Deep Learning (DL), is revolutionizing agricultural sustainability by advancing plant disease identification (Ayoub Shaikh et al. 2022, Wongchai et al. 2022). DL extends beyond single-crop disease identification, encompassing multiple crops and diseases (Lee et al. 2020). Utilizing computer vision and Internet of Things (IoT), AI enhances the ability to recognize and categorize plant diseases across diverse agricultural landscapes (Sinha and Dhanalakshmi 2022). The data used is crowdsourced from images captured through cameras or smartphones.
 However, to comprehensively monitor and understand plant diseases on a larger scale for diversity study, AI practitioners should integrate broader factors into their predictive modeling such as weather patterns, geographical variations, environmental conditions, and real-world challenges. Overcoming real-world challenges involves addressing previously unseen diseases, modeling disease distribution across extensive geographical areas, and managing domain adaptation, which arise from differences in data distributions between the source and target domains.
 An innovative plant disease identification framework has been established, benchmarked on the largest plant disease dataset (Mohanty et al. 2016). This framework specifically focuses on addressing the crucial challenges in this field. The reliability of DL models was thoroughly analyzed and evaluated through machine vision interpretation, and cases lacking labeled data were explored (Chai et al. 2023).

For instance, the effect of the environmental magnetic field is connected with the angle between the environmental magnetic field and the detected structure, which is referred to as the angle effect. This paper aims to explore the angle effect on the MMM method under the weak magnetic field. An anisotropic nonlinear magneto-mechanical constitutive relationship is proposed based on the magnetic domain theory and the approach law. Compared to the existing model, the present constitutive relationship in this paper can predict the stress-magnetization curve of ferromagnetic materials under the combined action of the loading stress and the environmental magnetic field with different directions. Based on the present constitutive relationship, an anisotropic nonlinear magneto-mechanical model of the MMM method is established, and then the angle effect is discussed in detail. The prediction of the anisotropic nonlinear magneto-mechanical model shows a good agreement with experimental data.

Damages caused during manufacture and the use of ferromagnetic materials may seriously undermine the safety of the engineering structure, and even lead to serious industrial accidents. For the early damage testing problem of ferromagnetic materials, it is imperative to propose and adopt new nondestructive testing methods. The metal magnetic memory (MMM) method, which is also known as the micromagnetic testing method, can achieve the early detection of damages in ferromagnetic materials such as steels. However, due to the lack of the quantitative research, the MMM method is only applicable for damage localization. In this paper, the MMM method is utilized to quantitatively evaluate the stress and crack in ferromagnetic materials. The inverse model including the objective function and optimization parameters is proposed. The reconstruction approach is established based on the conjugate gradient inversion method and the exact line search algorithm. In the theoretical analysis, the effectiveness of the MMM method in quantitative determination regarding the position and size of defects is verified with the experimental signal of a hole defect. Following this, the theoretical analyses of localization and sizing of stress and crack are conducted by using the simulation results as the measured signals. It can be found from the results that the MMM method can be applicable for quantitative evaluation of surface rectangular cracks, surface stress concentration zone, convex-type defect, and so on. In addition, the influences of the signal selection, sampling rate, lift-off value, stress level, and noise amplitude on the quantitative analysis of early stress concentration are discussed in details.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1109/tmag.2018.2856894,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47f07cdef024f9dc56fee46b63040214f2ea3a81,2018.0,Goal 9,0.01956429517731287,False,

This paper is devoted to the important issue of the effects caused by shear flow, as this flow always occurs in various electrochemical applications, such as electrodeposition, electroplating, and electrodialysis. In this paper, the dimensionless Poiseuille-Navier-Stokes and Poisson-Nernst-Planck model is proposed, which contains the buoyancy force induced by ion concentration polarization. The numerical results show that in the existing literature, the Rayleigh-Bénard convection is neglected and the Debye layer effect is overestimated, leading to a large difference between the simulation results and the experimental data. In addition, the chaotic phenomenon of shear flow is discussed in detail based on the proposed model. The main contributions are as follows: (i) There are two distinct instability phenomena, namely, electroconvective instability, caused by the electric force, and Rayleigh-Bénard instability, caused by the buoyancy force. (ii) For electroconvective instability, the fully overlapping vortex structures in the microchannel are obtained numerically for the first time. In addition, the shear sheltering effect is verified numerically. (iii) The effects of the characteristic length and electrohydrodynamic coupling constant on the Rayleigh-Bénard instability are studied. (iv) The transition condition from electroconvective instability to Rayleigh-Bénard instability is investigated. The analysis shows that choosing a characteristic length consistent with the actual structure is a necessary condition for achieving high-precision analysis of fluid behaviors such as the flow pattern.

However, the fact that there have been only a few studies of either how these factors affect the signals or the physical coupling mechanisms among them seriously limits the industrial applications of MMM testing. In this paper, a nonlinear constitutive relation for a ferromagnetic material considering the influences of temperature and elastoplastic state is established under a weak magnetic field and is used to establish a nonlinear thermo-magneto-elastoplastic coupling model of MMM testing.

One key issue on these nondestructive technologies is the magnetomechanical effect for quantitative evaluation of magnetization state from stress–strain condition. A representative phenomenological model has been proposed to explain the magnetomechanical effect by Jiles in 1995. However, the Jiles' model has some deficiencies in quantification, for instance, there is a visible difference between theoretical prediction and experimental measurements on stress–magnetization curve, especially in the compression case. Based on the thermodynamic relations and the approach law of irreversible magnetization, a nonlinear coupled model is proposed to improve the quantitative evaluation of the magnetomechanical effect. Excellent agreement has been achieved between the predictions from the present model and previous experimental results. In comparison with Jiles' model, the prediction accuracy is improved greatly by the present model, particularly for the compression case. A detailed study has also been performed to reveal the effects of initial magnetization status, cyclic loading, and demagnetization factor on the magnetomechanical effect. Our theoretical model reveals that the stable weak magnetic signals of nondestructive testing after multiple cyclic loads are attributed to the first few cycles eliminating most of the irreversible magnetization. Remarkably, the existence of demagnetization field can weaken magnetomechanical effect, therefore, significantly reduces the testing capability. This theoretical model can be adopted to quantitatively analyze magnetic memory signals, and then can be applied in weak magnetic nondestructive testing.",Crossref,100.0,10.1063/1.4945766,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4945766,2016.0,Goal 9,0.005733007260607837,False,

To isolate the causal effect of home equity on food insurance demand, we study the response of flood insurance take-up to sudden house price changes over the housing boom and bust in the 2000s. We find that flood insurance take-up follows the dynamics of house prices in each market over the boom-bust cycle, with a home price elasticity around 0.33.

As universities have been spotlighted as potential engines for high-value economic development, these ecosystems have received significantly more research and policy attention (Etzkowitz, 2003). Entrepreneurial ecosystems are complex, often poorly defined clusters of economic activity whose participants are linked variously by field, technology, geographic proximity or parent institution. It is not surprising that the innovation and commercialization outcomes of these systems are contingent on a variety of factors, including entrepreneurial behavior, cultural norms and the context of the originating university (Walshok et al., 2012; Zahra and Wright, 2011). Universities drive regional economic outcomes via basic research, teaching, knowledge transfer, policy developments, economic initiatives and other activities (Breznitz and Feldman, 2012). Although the regional economic benefits of university technology transfer are not consistent (Miner et al., 2001), universities clearly contribute to the formation of industry and innovation clusters (Porter, 1998). One important university activity that contributes to cluster development is the generation of de novo ventures. Venture development at the university-industry (UI) boundary is difficult and uncertain. Entrepreneurs, often academics with limited business training or experience, must acquire scarce resources, capabilities and partners (Alvarez and Barney, 2005). The experiences of academic entrepreneurs are highly idiosyncratic, and the outcomes of any given university spinout is difficult to predict from either endogenous or exogenous factors (Festel, 2013; Wright et al., 2012a; Yosuf and Jain, 2010). At the same time, characteristic and structural patterns suggest that the underlying venturing processes are similar across ecosystems (George and Bock, 2008).",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollchap/edcoll/9781785363436/9781785363436.00018.xml,2016.0,Goal 9,0.0625736789911713,True,innovation ecosystems

Citizens took to the streets to challenge the prevailing social justice framework. According to event systemstheory, these Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests were high-strength, as they represented novel, critical, and disruptive events. They were also mega-threats as they focused on threats to the social identities of the marginalized communities. Because different approaches were taken in navigating the BLM protests by authorities, it was unclear what constitutes effective leadership during these events. We integrate insights from event-oriented literature with intersectionality of gender and race research to introduce an intersectional leadership advantage (ILA). This framework suggests that Black women, owing in part to the rich tapestry of their social experiences, tend to develop a distinct leadership style characterized by sensitivity to racial injustice, leaning into risk, and commitment to the community. These qualities enable Black women leaders to be effective during events like BLM protests. Utilizing data from six public sources covering 11,540 protests across 3,338 U.S. cities from May to August 2020, we hypothesized an interaction of city police chiefs’ gender and race in relation to protest-related violence (measured in three ways).

We capture ethics of care leadership focused on racial inclusion with an index measure of a city’s racial spatial segregation, homeownership gap, poverty gap, and education gap, and we capture economic health with an index measure of a city’s employment growth, unemployment rate, housing vacancy rate, and median family income. We found that female-led cities were associated with better economic health, and this association was mediated by female-led cities’ association with greater racial inclusion.

People are agentic; they proactively make their way through the intricacies and dualities of life. To attain desired outcomes, people make judgments about the interplay among environment, personal factors, and consequences of their behavior. SCT conceptualizes these cognitive appraisals in terms of triadic, reciprocal, and asymmetric influences among the environment, person, and behavior. The belief system formed by the model’s cognitive dynamics is shaped by one’s current working conception of the world. This belief system guides behavior adaptively toward desirable pursuits and away from undesirable consequences. As people set goals, devise accordant courses of action, and anticipate outcomes, they act on this thread of beliefs. People operate on the environment, they monitor and analyze their actions, reflect on the consequences, and react to course-correct. These behaviors rely on self-awareness, self-reflection, and adaptive self-regulation. To explain and predict the fluent vagaries of social life, nuanced conceptions of interactive factors are conferred by SCT in the triadic model. A transformative contributor to adaptive self-regulation in SCT is perceived self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is a malleable belief formed by personal appraisal of how well a person can execute courses of action required to deal successfully with a given prospect. Self-efficacy does not signify people believe they can walk on water; it simply implies they believe they can enact the potential they already have.

Incorrectly or vaguely assigned deaths, defined as garbage-coded deaths, mask the true cause distribution. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has developed methods to create comparable, timely, cause-specific mortality estimates; an impactful data processing method is the reallocation of garbage-coded deaths to a plausible underlying cause of death. We identify the pattern of garbage-coded deaths in the world and present the methods used to determine their redistribution to generate more plausible cause of death assignments. Methods We describe the methods developed for the GBD 2019 study and subsequent iterations to redistribute garbage-coded deaths in vital registration data to plausible underlying causes. These methods include analysis of multiple cause data, negative correlation, impairment, and proportional redistribution. We classify garbage codes into classes according to the level of specificity of the reported cause of death (CoD) and capture trends in the global pattern of proportion of garbage-coded deaths, disaggregated by these classes, and the relationship between this proportion and the Socio-Demographic Index. We examine the relative importance of the top four garbage codes by age and sex and demonstrate the impact of redistribution on the annual GBD CoD rankings. Results The proportion of least-specific (class 1 and 2) garbage-coded deaths ranged from 3.7% of all vital registration deaths to 67.3% in 2015, and the age-standardized proportion had an overall negative association with the Socio-Demographic Index. When broken down by age and sex, the category for unspecified lower respiratory infections was responsible for nearly 30% of garbage-coded deaths in those under 1 year of age for both sexes, representing the largest proportion of garbage codes for that age group. We show how the cause distribution by number of deaths changes before and after redistribution for four countries: Brazil, the United States, Japan, and France, highlighting the necessity of accounting for garbage-coded deaths in the GBD.

Understanding the attributes that employers seek is critical in recruitment, retention, and educational design. In physiotherapy, there is a dearth of evidence on desirable attributes that employers seek from early-career physiotherapists. This study directly addresses this gap. The aims of this study were to identify the characteristics of the jobs advertised for early-career physiotherapists in Australia; determine which attributes were most desired when employing an early-career physiotherapist; and identify if there were differences in the attributes required based upon workplace location. Methods New graduate and early-career physiotherapy job advertisements were collected for six months from 1st October 2020 until 31st March 2021 from SEEK.com.au, a large online employment marketplace that operates across ten countries in the Asia Pacific and Latin America. Job advertisements needed to specify new graduate or early-career physiotherapist eligibility and be located within Australia. Data extraction were completed using QuestionPro ® . The Modified Monash Model was used to classify rurality of job location. Job advertisements were analysed descriptively and using content analysis to identify attributes. Results The search yielded 578 job advertisements with the greatest number collected in October 2020 (25.3%). Of the advertisements, 428 (74.0%) were in metropolitan locations (Modified Monash 1), 47 (8.1%) were in regional (Modified Monash 2), 99 (17.1%) were in rural locations (Modified Monash 3–5), and 4 (0.8%) were in remote locations (Modified Monash 6–7). Most roles were in private practice (63.3%) or aged care (21.7%). The top five attributes requested by employers were client focus, communication and interpersonal skills, team player, willingness to learn, and being able to build rapport, relationships, and networks. Academic results, resilience, and empathy were the least requested attributes. Differences in requested employability attributes increased with rurality. Conclusions This study addresses the current knowledge about attributes sought by employers for early-career physiotherapists. The most prevalent attributes requested were client focus and communication and interpersonal skills. This exploration of attributes can help to better prepare graduates for their first roles, align expectations, and increase understanding of priorities for entry level university programs, as well as identify priorities for support during transition to practice.

For example, hereditary spastic paraplegia is associated with >80 genes, with frequently only few affected individuals described for each gene. Herein, we characterize a large cohort of individuals with biallelic variation in ENTPD1 , a gene previously linked to spastic paraplegia 64 (Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 615683). Methods Individuals with biallelic ENTPD1 variants were recruited worldwide. Deep phenotyping and molecular characterization were performed.

Pathogenic variants in DPM1 and DPM2 are associated with muscle–eye–brain (MEB) disease, whereas DPM3 variants have mostly been reported in patients with isolated muscle disease—dystroglycanopathy. Thus far, only one affected individual with compound heterozygous DPM3 variants presenting with myopathy, mild intellectual disability, seizures, and nonspecific white matter abnormalities (WMA) around the lateral ventricles has been described. Here we present five affected individuals from four unrelated families with global developmental delay/intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe, microcephaly, seizures, WMA, muscle weakness and variable cardiomyopathy.

 Using both dictionary-based and topic modelling approaches, we examine whether and how credit analysts use borrowers’ qualitative disclosures to extract information pertaining to credit risk in making their assessments. We first decompose publicly-available ratings into qualitative factors (soft adjustments) and quantitative factors (hard adjustments). We find that credit analysts’ soft adjustments, but not the hard adjustments, reflect information in borrowers’ qualitative disclosures. Next, our results indicate that the association between firms’ qualitative disclosures and soft adjustments varies depending upon the rating agency’s reliance on public disclosure, access to management, and overall market uncertainty. Finally, we examine whether analysts’ use of credit risk-relevant information from borrowers’ qualitative disclosures increases the informativeness of credit rating downgrades. We find that the credit rating downgrades of borrowers that provide more qualitative disclosures are more informative than those who do not; however, the increase in informativeness diminishes after the Dodd-Frank Act, when legal liability and regulatory penalties for credit rating agencies increased.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1080/09638180.2022.2038227,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf188b54789649439318290425d17e6dc1545051,2022.0,Goal 16,0.0116375047278564,False,

Drawing on organizational learning literature, we develop a model to illuminate the mechanisms that can underlie time-varying risk taking tendency in entrepreneurship. In particular, we delineate conditions under which abrupt risk taking punctuates periods of risk-avoiding behaviors, a pattern that we call “intermittent risk taking.” We use serial entrepreneurs whose bouts with risk taking are often depicted as driven by an entrepreneurial itch to illustrate our model. In our conceptualization, decision makers engage in an interplay of experiential and vicarious learning as they move into and out of higher-risk self-employment (i.e., venture creation) with in-between stints in lower-risk wage-employment. Using a computational model to simulate the dynamics of this conceptualization, we find that vicarious learning from satisfied risk-avoiding peers can exert a pull that draws disappointed entrepreneurs into periods of risk avoidance (i.e., wage-employment). However, the moment that the satisfaction of these peers fails to convince, this pull wanes. In effect, the entrepreneur vicariously learns that the grass may not be greener on the other side which then leads them to return into self-employment. The itch for risk taking then recurs not necessarily because risky venture creation offers higher payoffs than risk-avoiding options but because decision makers come to see that risk avoidance may not be a satisfactory alternative either — a conceptualization that adds nuance to prior notions of varying risk tendencies and serial entrepreneurship.",Crossref,100.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1167243,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1167243,2023.0,Goal 8,0.04744510411624768,False,employment; employment opportunities; employment policies; entrepreneurship; labour market; productive employment; unemployment; women's employment

When a new market disrupts a firm’s standing routines, greater operating experience with these routines complicates adaptation and increases the firm’s uncertainty about the feasibility of entering, thereby delaying its entry. Yet, this entry uncertainty simultaneously prompts the firm to rely more heavily on learning from the observation of others entering which, in turn, hastens its entry. Patterns are opposite for firms that can leverage their standing routines into the new market. Here, greater operating experience and resultant momentum to extrapolate existing routines reduce a firm’s uncertainty about the feasibility of entry. This directly accelerates their entry but also diminishes the indirect, accelerating influence of observational learning. Because of these opposite dynamics, entry rates between firms with these different types of prior operating experience begin to diminish. Empirical analysis of entry patterns into the deregulation-created electric power trading market supports our theory and calls for modifications to previous expectations of prior operating experience exerting either a purely delaying or accelerating effect on entry, and, further, draws attention to the indirect pathways through which prior experience shapes entry patterns.",Crossref,100.0,10.1093/icc/dtab020,https://doi.org/10.1093/icc/dtab020,2021.0,Goal 4,0.009849788790208902,False,

Yet a signaling conflict can arise when a firm belongs to an organizational form that has a collective reputation for being unethical. In such circumstances, the firm's environmental performance may no longer credibly signal its underlying integrity capacity, leading markets to adjust downward the value they would otherwise place on the firm's environmental performance. Using longitudinal data on South Korean firms, we find that improvements in firm environmental performance lead to smaller increases in market values for firms belonging to a poorly reputed organizational form.

Several lantibiotic compounds had better MIC against C. difficile, compared to vancomycin, but not against other bacterial species tested.

The potential withdrawal by the large lender causes small investors to panic and to close positions even if the large lender does not. Facing funding problems, the borrower has to cut its activities, contributing to further shocks to the supply of market liquidity. The original shock is exacerbated, which reinforces withdrawals by all creditors. The model helps explain how the spreading of liquidity shocks from the broker–dealer sector to the hedge fund sector and the feedback contribute to a systemic crisis.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/jmcb.12411,https://doi.org/10.1111/jmcb.12411,2017.0,Goal 1,0.02880364446354675,False,

We build on compensatory control theory, which suggests that low personal control can lead people to prefer societal systems that impose order, to examine the mutual constitution of personal control and cultural tightness. Specifically, we tested whether individuals' lack of personal control increases their preference for tighter cultures as a means of restoring order and predictability, and whether tighter cultures in turn reduce people's feelings of personal control. Seven studies (five preregistered) with participants from the United States, Singapore, and China examine this cycle of mutual constitution. Specifically, documenting the correlational link between person and culture, we found that Americans lower on personal control preferred to live in tighter states (Study 1). Chinese employees lower on personal control also desired more structure and preferred a tighter organizational culture (Study 2). Employing an experimental causal chain design, Studies 3-5 provided causal evidence for our claim that lack of control increases desire for tighter cultures via the need for structure. Finally, tracing the link back from culture to person, Studies 6a and 6b found that whereas tighter cultures decreased perceptions of individual personal control, they increased people's sense of collective control. Overall, the findings document the process of mutual constitution of culture and psyche: lack of personal control leads people to seek more structured, tighter cultures, and that tighter cultures, in turn, decrease people's sense of personal control but increase their sense of collective control.

Recent years have witnessed a raging debate about whether to raise their minimum wages. Why do some decision-makers support raising wages and others do not? Ten studies (four preregistered) examined people's beliefs about the malleability of intelligence as a key antecedent. The more U.S. human resource managers (Study 1) and Indian business owners (Study 2) believed that people's intelligence can grow (i.e., had a growth mindset), the more they supported increasing low-wage workers' compensation. In key U.S. swing states (Study 3a), and a nationally representative sample (Study 3b), residents with a more growth mindset were more willing to support ballot propositions increasing the minimum wage and other compensation. Study 4 provided causal evidence. The next two studies confirmed the specificity of the predictor. People's beliefs about the malleability of intelligence, but not personality (Study 5a) or effort (Study 5b), predicted their support for increasing low-wage workers' compensation. Study 6 examined multiple potential mechanisms, including empathy, attributions for poverty, and environmental affordances. The relationship between growth mindset and support for raising low-wage workers' wages was explained by more situational rather than dispositional attributions for poverty. Finally, Studies 7a and 7b replicated the effect of growth mindset on support for increasing low-wage workers' compensation and provided confirmatory evidence for the mediator-situational, rather than dispositional, attributions of poverty.

If total donations exceed a prespecified funding target, the entrepreneur distributes nonmonetary rewards to contributors; otherwise, their donations are refunded. We study how to design such campaigns when contributors choose not just whether to contribute, but also when to contribute. We show that strategic contribution behavior—when contributors intentionally delay until campaign success is likely—can arise from the combination of nonrefundable (potentially very small) hassle costs and the risk of campaign failure, and can explain pledging patterns commonly observed in crowdfunding. Furthermore, such delays do not hurt the entrepreneur if contributors are perfectly rational, but they do if contributors are distracted , that is, if they might fail to return to the campaign after an intentional delay. To mitigate this, we find that an entrepreneur can use a simple menu of rewards with a fixed number of units sold at a low price, and an unlimited number sold at a higher price; this segments contributors over time based on the information they observe upon arrival. We show that, despite its simplicity, such a menu performs well compared to a theoretically optimal menu consisting of an infinite number of different rewards and price levels under many conditions.",Crossref,100.0,10.1002/nav.22081,https://doi.org/10.1002/nav.22081,2022.0,Goal 12,0.004605183196184951,False,

Consequently transient landscapes (i.e., not in topographic steady state) predominate, characterized by focused incision along extensional fault scarps and regional tectonic tilting of surface slopes across strike. Using a field-calibrated numerical model to explore the controls on landscape evolution across the Corinth rift, central Greece, we demonstrate that this tilting, although subtle, leads to a shift in dominant source area as well as a shift toward sediment-starved conditions within the basin. We show, by comparing model runs with and without imposing tectonic forcing, that the impact of active faulting on relief development along the most active Corinth rift margin locally increases erosion rates and footwall incision. However, the overall sediment flux from this margin is reduced because back-tilting lowers erosion rates in catchment headwaters. Conversely, the hanging-wall side of the rift, as it is downwarped, supplies relatively more sediment as rift-directed channel slopes increase even though the relief is decreasing. In summary, we show that tilting plays a key role in controlling the syn-rift sediment flux and, in a counterintuitive way, modifies the relationship between topographic relief and catchmentaveraged erosion rates. Our results provide a new perspective on the origin and timing of sediment starvation relative to structural development in rifts. INTRODUCTION Source-to-sink studies in rifts focus heavily on patterns of vertical motion along active normal faults (e.g., Cowie et al., 2000; Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000). Normal faulting not only increases maximum footwall relief and creates hanging-wall accommodation, but also commonly controls sediment entry points along the rift margin. In contrast, the flexural response to active normal faulting leads to differential uplift and/or subsidence, i.e., tilting, as a function of distance away from rift margins regardless of whether highor low-angle normal faults form (Bell et al., 2017). Hence, large areas of catchments may undergo changes in slope as part of the transient landscape response to active faulting (e.g., Cowie et al., 2006). Any resulting variation in sediment production in space or time affects the facies architecture of the syn-rift fill as well as the potential for feedback between surface mass transfer and tectonics and therefore the structural evolution of the rift (e.g., Maniatis et al., 2009). Here we perform a surface-process modeling experiment using a natural example of a transient landscape, the Corinth rift, central Greece, where a wealth of published observations of the entire source-to-sink system allows us to explore the impact of observed tectonic forcing on sediment flux. Previous modeling studies of idealized transient landscapes (e.g., Attal et al., 2008) show that over long time scales (~106 yr), tilting can lead to drainage-divide migration in extensional settings, but do not consider the impact on relief. By using Corinth as a test case, and focusing on a time scale over which drainage divide migration is minimal (~105 yr), we are able to address the following question: If tilting is as important as footwall uplift for relief development along rift margins, what are the consequences for sediment production and ultimately for rift-basin evolution? STUDY AREA AND METHODS The Corinth rift in central Greece initiated at ca. 5 Ma and cuts across the preexisting Hellenide fold-and-thrust belt (Leeder et al., 2008). Progressive growth and linkage of normal faults and northward migration of fault activity has resulted in the formation of an east-west–striking asymmetric marine half-graben, ~120 km long and up to 30 km wide (i.e., the Gulf of Corinth; Fig. 1). The syn-rift deformation has been the focus of numerous onshore and offshore studies (e.g., Bell et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2009), which demonstrate progressive localization of deformation during the Quaternary onto major north-dipping faults bounding the southern rift margin. We use the surface-processes model pyBadlands (Salles et al., 2018) to simulate landscape development and basin stratigraphy within the Corinth rift. The model integrates hillslope diffusion and river incision by means of a modified stream power law, allowing for balanced sediment transport and deposition under varying tectonic and climatic forcings. We calibrate our model using data for the last 130 k.y. of rift evolution. For this time period, the history of the basin is particularly well constrained. We use published Quaternary uplift and subsidence rates (Table DR2 and Fig. DR1 in the GSA Data Repository1) and fault geometry data (Nixon et al., 2016; Bell et al., 2017) to derive the three-dimensional spatial distribution of uplift and subsidence rates that are imposed 1GSA Data Repository item 2019094, Table DR1 (model input), Table DR2 (uplift/subsidence rates), Table DR3 (model calibration and sensitivity tests), Table DR4 (erosion rate data), Figure DR1 (displacement map), Figure DR2 (bedrock erodibility), and Figure DR3 (erosion rate analysis), is available online at http:// www .geosociety .org /datarepository /2019/, or on request from editing@ geosociety .org.

Onshore lithostratigraphic units are grouped based on elevation and slope to generate a bedrock erodibility map (Fig. DR2). We include a global sea-level curve to account for eustatic versus lacustrine fluctuations of the base level, and time-averaged climatic data to simulate spatial variations in mean precipitation. Transported sediment is deposited offshore or in depressions on land according to diffusion (Table DR1). The present-day topography is used as the initial surface in all of our model runs. We calculate time-averaged rates of erosion and sedimentation assuming that 130 k.y. is of sufficient length to average out effects of climatic variability on surface processes but is sufficiently short to capture the transient behavior of the landscape. Model calibration is based on comparing modeled sediment volumes with those obtained from a published interpretation of offshore seismic reflection data (Nixon et al., 2016). We estimate a total offshore (i.e., depositional) grain volume of ~80 km3 for the past 130 k.y. from the offshore data, which corresponds to ~120 km3 of onshore (i.e., eroded) volume after correcting for rock porosity onshore. We neglect dissolution in our model, as the deposited sediments are sands, silts, and clays generated by fluvial erosion of the rift margins (see the Data Repository). Additionally, we use geomorphic measures for the present-day and modeled landscapes plus hillslope gradient and curvature to validate our modeling results. Finally, sensitivity tests for erodibility, precipitation, sea level, and hillslope diffusion were performed to quantify the level of uncertainty in our results (Table DR3). RESULTS Modeled sediment volumes imply a timeaveraged sediment supply to the rift of ~9.5 × 105 m3/yr over the last 130 k.y. (Fig. 1). This value is in close agreement with the sediment volume inferred from the offshore data (i.e., 120 km3 / 130 k.y. = 9.2 × 105 m3/yr) (see the Data Repository). Furthermore, the modeled offshore depositional pattern is comparable to the results of Nixon et al. (2016) showing depocenters in the central part of the Gulf of Corinth that depict maximum sedimentation rates of ~2.5 mm/yr in the immediate hanging wall of the most active faults. Output from our calibrated model (Fig. 1) indicates that over 130 k.y. the time-averaged sediment supply from the southern margin of the rift accounts for roughly only half of the total supply (53%) to the offshore even though active tectonic uplift is concentrated along this margin. There is a strong linear correlation between catchment area and the sediment volume produced (R2 = 0.966; see inset in Fig. 1), and ~50% of the total drainage area lies along the northern, hanging-wall side of the rift and contributes the remaining 47%. Thus, although the southernmargin faults play an obvious role in controlling asymmetric basin subsidence and offshore depositional patterns (Fig. 1), their role in generating onshore relief and potentially enhancing sediment production is more complex. For example, large catchments (>240 km2), which supply the greatest amounts of sediment (>5 × 104 m3/yr; Figs. 1 and 2), occur along both margins and drain areas of preexisting high topography of the Hellenide orogen in the western part of the rift. In contrast, along the central part of the southern margin (i.e., zone C in Fig. 2), where relative uplift rates are highest (u̇ ≈ 2 mm/yr; Fig. 2A) and catchment-averaged erosion rates are also high (ė ≥ 0.3 mm/yr; Fig. 2C), the catchments are generally small (<100 km2) and contribute relatively little sediment (<1 × 104 m3/yr; Figs. 1 and 2B). Our model results also show that, along the southern margin, ė correlates with a combination of u̇ and maximum relief (Cmax, in m) (Figs. 2A and 2D). A multiple regression analysis that takes into account that u̇ and Cmax may also be correlated yields the following relation: ė = a Cmax + b u̇, where a = 1 × 10–4 yr–1 an",Semantic Scholar,35.77235772357723,10.1130/G45589.1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/338b1d5660da80e13ecafe29f5a3009c1ff81229,2019.0,Goal 17,0.02238187174082428,False,

 The majority consists of recombination lines arising from the ionized gas layer bordering the PDR. The line ratios are well matched by emissivity coefficients from H recombination theory, but deviate by up to 10 because of contamination by He i lines.

Optimal management of perioperative intravenous fluids may reduce mortality rates and improve outcomes from surgery. Previous small trials of cardiac-output guided haemodynamic therapy algorithms in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery have suggested this intervention results in reduced complications and a modest reduction in mortality. However, this existing evidence is based mainly on elective (planned) surgery, with little evaluation in the emergency setting. There are fundamental clinical and pathophysiological differences between the planned and emergency surgical setting which may influence the effects of this intervention. A large definitive trial in emergency surgery is needed to confirm or refute the potential benefits observed in elective surgery and to inform widespread clinical practice. Methods The FLO-ELA trial is a multi-centre, parallel-group, open, randomised controlled trial. 3138 patients aged 50 and over undergoing major emergency gastrointestinal surgery will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio using minimisation to minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring to guide protocolised administration of intra-venous fluid, or usual care without cardiac output monitoring. The trial intervention will be carried out during surgery and for up to 6 h postoperatively. The trial is funded through an efficient design call by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) programme and uses existing routinely collected datasets for the majority of data collection. The primary outcome is the number of days alive and out of hospital within 90 days of randomisation. Participants and those delivering the intervention will not be blinded to treatment allocation. Participant recruitment started in September 2017 with a 1-year internal pilot phase and is ongoing at the time of publication.

Despite the growing usage of exercise applications, the efficacy of in-exercise app features in driving usage and athletic outcomes remains poorly understood. To remain competitive, sports organizations now need to leverage tracking tools to efficiently allocate resources and streamline training regimens and interventions for their core assets (i.e., athletes). In response to these operational needs, we examine two specific forms of such in-exercise interventions, namely performance feedback and social feedback. We conducted an 18-month-long field study with 1,037 uniformed group servicemen to assess the effect of these feedback types on running and usage outcomes. Results from the field study provided evidence that these two app features improved the servicemen’s running times and frequency of application usage, on average. Contrary to the common belief that more features are better, the joint usage of two feedback features does not produce additive effects. Tests at more granular levels suggest that users who received both feedback types in exercise episodes exhibit overconfidence behavior by participating in fewer subsequent exercises. The receipt of both feedback may be redundant and can cause user annoyance. Heterogeneity tests revealed that while performance feedback benefited most runners, social features were effective only for already stronger runners.

Methodology/results: We use a differences-in-differences design, exploiting the staggered introduction of Tesla Supercharger stations across the United States. We combine data on Supercharger installations with mobile phone–based estimates of retailer foot traffic. We explore heterogeneity in the treatment effect, in terms of EV charger characteristics, visitor characteristics, establishment type, and local physical context. We estimate that establishments experience an average 4% increase in monthly visits following the installation of a Tesla Supercharger. These effects arise primarily for retailers that offer relatively quick services (e.g., fast food) and for those located very near to the charger (within 150 meters). The effects are also more pronounced when the Supercharger is one of the first EV chargers introduced into the local area.

In this work, we explore whether, when, and how using those features may impact retailer demand. We tackle this question via a multimethod study. We begin by conducting a controlled experiment on Prolific.co , presenting subjects with actual Google Places business profiles for a set of Black-owned restaurants in Chicago. We randomly vary the presence of Black- and women-owned labels in these profiles and assess subjects’ expectations of popularity and quality along various restaurant dimensions. Our results demonstrate that the Black-owned label, in particular, drives significant increases in all outcomes with the effects arising primarily from Black and democratically liberal subjects. Next, we conduct an archival analysis of the effect label adoption has on the physical foot traffic that retailers receive based on SafeGraph’s mobile patterns database. Our difference-in-differences estimations yield consistent results; we find evidence of a positive average effect on foot traffic volumes. Further, we show that a rise in visitors from liberal-leaning geographies drives these effects. We discuss implications for digital platform operators and retailers.

This scalable evaluation mechanism offers a collective benefit. However, contestants may also leverage it to achieve personal, competitive benefits. Our study examines this tension from a status-theoretic perspective, suggesting that the conflict between competitive and collective benefits, and the net implication for evaluation efficacy, is influenced by contestants’ status. On the one hand, contestants of lower status may be viewed as less skilled and hence more likely to make mistakes. Therefore, low-status contestants may attract more evaluations if said evaluations are driven predominantly by an interest in collective benefits. On the other hand, if evaluations are driven largely by an interest in personal, competitive benefits, a low-status contestant makes for a less attractive target and hence may attract fewer evaluations. We empirically test these competing possibilities using a dataset of coding contests from Codeforces. The platform allows contestants to assess others’ submissions and improve evaluations (a collective benefit) by devising test cases (hacks) in addition to those defined by the contest organizer. If a submission is successfully hacked, the hacker earns additional points, and the target submission is eliminated from the contest (a competitive benefit). We begin by providing qualitative evidence based on semi-structured interviews conducted with contestants spanning the status spectrum at Codeforces. Next, we present quantitative evidence exploiting a structural change at Codeforces wherein many contestants experienced an arbitrary status reduction unrelated to their performance because of sudden changes to the platform’s color-coding system around contestant ratings. We show that status-loser contestants received systematically more evaluations from other contestants, absent changes in their short-run submission quality. Finally, we show that the excess evaluations allocated toward affected contestants were less effective, indicating status-driven evaluations as potentially less efficacious.

To do so, we exploit the phased entry of the platform Grubhub into U.S. counties from 2005 to 2019 using a difference-in-difference approach. Results indicate that the availability of such delivery services leads to a significant reduction in time spent preparing meals within the home, with no concomitant change in dining out.

Integrating communication in addition to the inherited weakness of the power grid paves the way to countless number of security threats to target its communication networks, therefore ensuring secure data exchange is a key concern for AMI networks. In this regard, many schemes are proposed in the literature to secure this two‐way communication, however, very little effort has been focused on multicast transmissions carried out between the control center and a group of smart meters. In order to empower efficient, authentic, and confidential data exchange, this article proposes a new signcryption scheme for multicast downlink communication in edge envisioned AMI networks. The proposed scheme is constructed based on ciphertext‐policy attribute‐based encryption to attain secure fine‐grained access control for the multirecipient communication between the utility control center and a group of smart meters. The novelty of our scheme lies behind the fact that it is an elliptic curve cryptosystem that is pairing free, in opposite to most ABE schemes. Instead of the complex bilinear pairing operations, we exploited faster elliptic curve point multiplication operations to construct the proposed signcryption model. we demonstrate the strength of our protocol in defending against passive, collusion, reply, data modification, and signature forgery attacks.

Our sample of 6,200 market jumps yields several findings. First, policy news – mainly associated with monetary policy and government spending – triggers a greater share of upward than downward jumps in all countries. Second, the policy share of upward jumps is inversely related to stock market performance in the preceding three months. This pattern strengthens in the postwar period. Third, market volatility is much lower after jumps triggered by monetary policy news than after other jumps, unconditionally and conditional on past volatility and other controls. Fourth, greater clarity as to jump reason also foreshadows lower volatility. Clarity in this sense has trended upwards over the past century. Finally, and excluding U.S. jumps, leading newspapers attribute one-third of jumps in their own national stock markets to developments that originate in or relate to the United States. The U.S. role in this regard dwarfs that of Europe and China.

We found that after taking an introductory finance class, relative to a control class, students overclaimed more knowledge they did not have, that is, endorsed more familiarity with bogus finance terms and expressed more confidence under incentives in their ability to answer questions about these terms. This finding was replicated in a Psychology and Law class, compared with a control class, with overclaiming still elevated two years later. In two follow-up experiments, participants in a hypothetical consulting context were randomly assigned to introductory training on GPS or a control topic. Participants in the GPS condition overclaimed more knowledge of bogus GPS terms and were more confident in their knowledge of real material never covered in the training, controlling for test performance. These effects were explained by introductory education both increasing self-perceived expertise in the education domain and creating basic schematic understanding that accommodates plausible but incorrect interpretations of unknown content. Introductory education, then, does not necessarily improve learners’ skills at identifying lack of knowledge. Rather, it can lead to an illusion of knowledge for unknown material, causing learners to overestimate their “circle of competence.” This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

One of the most effective strategies for understanding information is to explain it, for instance to a hypothetical other (Pilots 1 and 2). Yet, we find that learners prefer equally effortful but less effective learning strategies, even when incentivized to perform well (Study 1). Critically, we propose and find that learners' reluctance to explain is tied to their subjective knowledge of the material; learners who feel less knowledgeable about what they learned are most reluctant to explain it, despite the strategy being as effective for them (Study 2). An intervention that increased subjective knowledge (by having learners answer a few easy questions) increased learners' choice to explain, which was mediated by learners believing that explaining would be more pleasant and effective (Study 3). Directly manipulating beliefs about how fun and effective explaining is also boosted learners' willingness to explain (Study 4). Finally, because Studies 1-4 incentivized performance financially, we replicated key results in the classroom with students, finding improved scores on a class quiz (Study 5). The paradoxical implication of these findings is that those who need effective learning strategies the most are the ones least likely to use them. Put together, we find that subjective knowledge plays a key role in learning decisions and that boosting subjective knowledge is a simple intervention that can improve learning-related choices.

Because long-term memory is better for valuable items than for neutral items, we asked whether the attentional boost effect is due to changes in the perceived value of items that are paired with targets. In three experiments, participants memorised a series of briefly presented images that depicted valuable (e.g., food) or neutral (e.g., children’s toys) items. Whenever an item appeared, a square flashed in its centre. Participants pressed a button if the square was a target colour but not if it was a distractor colour.

RSC Advances. doi:10.1039/c7ra12397c",2018,"Sanguanmith, (2018) Self-radiolysis of tritiated water","The effect of the azide ion N3− on the yield of molecular hydrogen in water irradiated with 60Co γ-rays (∼1 MeV Compton electrons) and tritium β-electrons (mean electron energy of ∼7.8 keV) at 25 °C is investigated using Monte Carlo track chemistry simulations in conjunction with available experimental data. N3− is shown to interfere with the formation of H2 through its high reactivity towards hydrogen atoms and, but to a lesser extent, hydrated electrons, the two major radiolytic precursors of the H2 yield in the diffusing radiation tracks. Chemical changes are observed in the H2 scavengeability depending on the particular type of radiation considered. These changes can readily be explained on the basis of differences in the initial spatial distribution of primary radiolytic species (i.e., the structure of the electron tracks). In the “short-track” geometry of the higher “linear energy transfer” (LET) tritium β-electrons (mean LET ∼5.9 eV nm−1), radicals are formed locally in much higher initial concentration than in the isolated “spurs” of the energetic Compton electrons (LET ∼0.3 eV nm−1) generated by the cobalt-60 γ-rays. As a result, the short-track geometry favors radical–radical reactions involving hydrated electrons and hydrogen atoms, leading to a clear increase in the yield of H2 for tritium β-electrons compared to 60Co γ-rays. These changes in the scavengeability of H2 in passing from tritium β-radiolysis to γ-radiolysis are in good agreement with experimental data, lending strong support to the picture of tritium β-radiolysis mainly driven by the chemical action of short tracks of high local LET. At high N3− concentrations (>1 M), our H2 yield results for 60Co γ-radiolysis are also consistent with previous Monte Carlo simulations that suggested the necessity of including the capture of the precursors to the hydrated electrons (i.e., the short-lived “dry” electrons prior to hydration) by N3−. These processes tend to reduce significantly the yields of H2, as is observed experimentally. However, this dry electron scavenging at high azide concentrations is not seen in the higher-LET 3H β-radiolysis, leading us to conclude that the increased amount of intra-track chemistry intervening at early time under these conditions favors the recombination of these electrons with their parent water cations at the expense of their scavenging by N3−.",Semantic Scholar,77.27272727272728,10.1039/c7ra12397c,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/626595f461ffa9cc87ba0c6be3976a01873ee758,2018.0,Goal 6,0.04663647649897137,False,

Although this result is well established, the applicability of this sudden drop in k(eaq−+eaq−)) above ∼150°C to neutral or slightly acidic solution, as recommended by some authors, still remains uncertain. In fact, the recent work suggested that in near-neutral water the abrupt change in k above ∼150°C does not occur and that k should increase, rather than decrease, at temperatures greater than 150°C with roughly the same Arrhenius dependence of the data below 150°C. In view of this uncertainty of k, Monte Carlo simulations were used in this study to examine the sensitivity of the density dependence of the yield of eaq− in the low–linear energy transfer (LET) radiolysis of supercritical water (H2O) at 400°C on variations in the temperature dependence of k. Two different values of the eaq− self-reaction rate constant at 400°C were used: one was based on the temperature dependence of k above 150°C as measured in alkaline water (4.2×108 M−1 s−1), and the other was based on an Arrhenius extrapolation of the values below 150°C (2.5×1011 M−1 s−1).

Only a small effect of k on the variation of G(eaq−)) as a function of density at 60 ps and 1 ns could be observed.

Allergen‐specific immunotherapy (AIT) can only modify the natural course of the disease. Conventional routes of HDM AIT are subcutaneous or sublingual. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) has a disadvantage of systemic hypersensitive reaction, and the sublingual immunotherapy has a disadvantage of local allergic reaction and low drug adherence. Objective To overcome the weak points of conventional AIT, we developed a HDM loaded biodegradable microneedle patch (MNP) for transdermal immunotherapy (TDIT). We aim to demonstrate the efficacy of TDIT in murine asthma model triggered by HDM compared with conventional SCIT. Methods To make HDM asthma mouse model, 5‐week‐old BALB/c female mice were sensitized and challenged by intranasal administration of HDM. The mice were divided into 5 groups: sham, asthma, low (10 µg) and high dose (100 µg) SCIT, and TDIT (10 µg). To make HDM loaded MNP, droplet‐born air blowing method was used. Airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic inflammation markers were analysed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, immunohistochemistry, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) analysis, and lung cytokine assays. Results Airway hyperresponsiveness was ameliorated by TDIT. Eosinophilic inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage was improved without adverse reactions.

The authors also investigate the efficacy of co-location as a strategy to enhance knowledge transfer from one organization to another. Design/methodology/approach To study the impact of national culture on production process moves, the authors develop and employ a team-based behavioral experiment within and between an individualist society (the United States) and a collectivist one (China). The authors also examine the impact of co-location on knowledge transfer effectiveness within and between these two unique cultures. Findings Interestingly, co-location has little impact on the performance of US recipient teams. Without co-location, Chinese recipient team performance lags significantly behind the US teams. However, firms can overcome these knowledge transfer challenges by co-locating source and recipient team members. These results suggest that firms should assess the national cultural context when considering co-location to manage their production move. There are contexts where co-location may be incredibly useful to facilitate an effective knowledge transfer (e.g. collectivist cultures like China) and contexts where this approach may not be as valuable (e.g. individualistic cultures such as the United States). Originality/value This research contributes to the academic literature in several ways. First, while past research demonstrates that national culture can be an essential barrier to information and knowledge sharing, this paper extends these findings showing that co-location may effectively overcome this barrier. After the authors offer and test the merits of co-location, they also establish the boundary conditions of this approach by showing that the effect of co-location on knowledge transfer is contingent on the cultural context. This contribution enhances our understanding of the relationship between national culture and knowledge sharing and has implications for managers developing approaches to transfer knowledge between cultures. Second, the authors develop and execute a novel cross-country experimental design.

Motivated by common forecasting practices in industry, our research examines whether forecasters recognize this difference between demand forecasts and demand plans. Based on a lab experiment informed by data from two large FMCG companies, we found that forecasters factor service levels into their demand forecasts, even when they are clearly instructed to predict the most likely demand and incentivized to minimize the forecast error.

Information criteria or cross-validation are common approaches of forecast model selection. Both methods compare forecasts with the respective actual realizations. However, no existing selection method assesses out-of-sample forecasts before the actual values become available—a technique used in human judgment in this context. Research in judgmental model selection emphasizes that human judgment can be superior to statistical selection procedures in evaluating the quality of forecasting models. We, therefore, propose a new way of statistical model selection based on these insights from human judgment. Our approach relies on an asynchronous comparison of forecasts and actual values, allowing for an ex ante evaluation of forecasts via representativeness. We test this criterion on numerous time series. Results from our analyses provide evidence that forecast performance can be improved when models are selected based on their representativeness.

Ramping up Production with the Use of Augmented Reality","Problem definition: Firms increasingly use augmented reality (AR) devices to improve their production ramp-up processes. These devices appear useful, yet little is known about their broader impact on worker productivity and behavior. Academic/practical relevance: Efficient production ramp-ups are particularly important when product life cycles are short. An ongoing debate among academics and practitioners pertains to how Industry 4.0, and AR devices in particular, can accelerate the ramp-up. The current study provides empirical evidence related to AR in the production ramp-up context, examines the strengths and weaknesses of AR, and tests four hypotheses, leading to a more nuanced view of AR use in the manufacturing ramp-up. Methodology: A framed field experiment in a manufacturing plant provides a test of how quickly workers can perform new tasks with and without AR support and how the use of AR affects their ability to suggest process improvements. Results: When faced with a new task, workers instructed by AR smart glasses use 43.8% less time to complete the task compared with a control group that relies on paper-based instructions. However, workers that use AR glasses consistently use 23% more time than the control group when both groups repeat the task without either AR or paper-based instructions. Task difficulty moderates this relationship; workers assigned to a more difficult task benefit the most from AR instructions. After the devices are removed, workers instructed based on paper improve their productivity faster through learning than those instructed by AR. In addition, the former group suggests better process improvements than the latter one. Managerial implications: Although these results indicate substantially higher productivity resulting from AR devices, they also support the view that, once instructed through AR devices, workers come to rely on this new technology without fully internalizing the task. This failure to internalize their task then leads workers to suggest less useful process improvements.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2021.1070,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.1070,2022.0,Goal 9,0.01848627494646473,False,industry

To this end, they commonly employ two different and somewhat contradictory intervention approaches. One approach uses punitive tactics to coerce firms to change, while the other approach uses supportive tactics to encourage change. Using the context of government agencies promoting environmental improvements in firms, we examine whether such punitive (e.g., regulatory inspections with possible sanctions) and supportive (e.g., environmental assistance, improvement recommendations) tactics can be administered in a complementary manner. Using a unique and novel longitudinal data set collected from two state-level environmental agencies in Minnesota, we analyze over 1,000 supportive environmental improvement (EI) projects in combination with intermittent (but currently uncoordinated) punitive tactics. One key finding from our research is that the timing, severity, and relatedness of punitive tactics is critical for directing managerial attention and thus improving the efficacy of supportive tactics (i.e., EI implementation). Contingent on their timing, inspections can increase EI implementation rates by up to 60% but can also reduce implementation rates by up to 50% compared with EIs in facilities that do not experience inspections. Classifying regulatory inspections as (1) either clean or adverse and (2) either related or unrelated allows us to further explain the influence of such punitive tactics on EI implementation.

However, surprisingly little research examines the relationship between such inspections and future product quality. In this paper, we study how well plant inspection outcomes predict the hazard of a future recall and analyze how investigator experience affects this predictive relationship. Using secondary data spanning a seven-year period in the medical device industry and a recurrent-event Cox proportional hazard model, our analysis shows that inspection outcomes reliably predict future product recalls. However, inspection outcomes become an unreliable predictor of recalls with an increase in site-specific investigator experience. Through post hoc analysis, we also show that the hazard of a recall at a plant increases with site-specific experience, independent of the inspection outcome. Compared to the first visit by an investigator, the recall hazard increases by 21% the second time the investigator visits a specific plant, and by 57% on the third visit.

Human judgment is of practical importance in this setting. Our goal is to investigate what type of decision support, in particular historical and/or contextual predictors, should be provided to human forecasters to improve their ability to detect and exploit linear and nonlinear cue–criterion relationships in the task environment. Using a field experiment on new product forecasts in the music industry, our analysis reveals that when forecasters are concerned with predictive accuracy and only managerial judgments are employed, providing both types of decision support data is beneficial. However, if judgmental forecasts are combined with a statistical forecast, restricting the decision support provided to human judges to contextual anchors is beneficial. We identify two novel interactions demonstrating that the exploitation of nonlinearities is easiest for human judgment if contextual data are present but historical data are absent. Thus, if the role of human judgment is to detect these nonlinearities (and the linearities are taken care of by some statistical model with which judgments are combined), then a restriction of the decision support provided makes sense. Implications for the theory and practice of building decision support models are discussed.",Crossref,92.06349206349206,10.1016/j.jom.2015.02.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jom.2015.02.001,2015.0,Goal 16,0.02477631533093888,False,

There is a differential in prostate cancer mortality between black and white men. Advances in precision medicine have shifted the research focus toward underlying genetic differences. However, non-biologic factors may play a large role in these observed disparities.


OBJECTIVE
To measure the relative importance of race compared to healthcare and social factors on PCa specific mortality.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Database, we identified 514,878 PCa cases diagnosed at age ≥ 40 between 2004-2012. We also selected a subset of cases matching black men to white men by age, stage, and birth year. We stratified patients by age (40-54, 55-69, 70+) and disease stage resulting in 18 groups. Applying random forest methods with variable importance measures, we analyzed 15 variables and their interactions across four categories of factors (tumor characteristics, race, healthcare factors, and social factors) and their relative importance for PCa specific mortality.


RESULTS
Tumor characteristics at time of diagnosis were the most important factors for PCa mortality. Across all groups, race was less than 5% as important as tumor characteristics, and only more important than healthcare and social factors for 2/18 groups. Although race had a significant impact, healthcare and social factors, known to be associated with racial disparities, had greater or similarly important effects across all ages and stages.


CONCLUSION
Eradicating disparities in prostate cancer survival will take a multi-pronged approach including advances in precision medicine. Disparities will persist unless healthcare access and social equality is achieved among all populations.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),95.5223880597015,10.1097/ju.0000000000000416,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45fed53a37d95111437237477679284e28cae265,2019.0,Goal 1,0.05699467065322388,True,poverty alleviation

Methods We conducted a single‐centre retrospective review, over a 6‐year period (2010–2015), to identify men with RTOG grade 4 UAE s after RT for PC a. RT was classified as combined therapy (radical prostatectomy [ RP ] followed by external beam radiotherapy [ EBRT ], EBRT + low‐dose‐rate [ LDR ] brachytherapy, EBRT + high‐dose‐rate [ HDR ] brachytherapy or other combinations of RT ) or monotherapy RT . UAE s were classified as outlet (urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture, prostate necrosis, or recto‐urethral fistula) or bladder (contraction, necrosis, fistula, ureteric stricture or haemorrhage) UAE s. Results We identified 73 men with a mean age of 73 years. Of these, 44 (60%) received combined therapy, consisting of RP + EBRT ( n = 19), HDR brachytherapy + EBRT ( n = 19), LDR brachytherapy + EBRT ( n = 5), and other combined RT ( n = 1).

High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) can serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars.

We report, for the first time, on a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM - Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase – when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction – during which significant changes in absorption are expected. Methods. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. Results. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributable to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K α doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1 together with the presence of already known Fe K β and Ni K α lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of 10 2 km s −1 are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. Conclusions.

Ultraluminous and hyper-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs and HLXs) are among the brightest astrophysical objects in the X-ray sky. While ULXs are most likely to host stellar-mass compact objects accreting at super-Eddington rates, HLXs are compelling candidates for accreting intermediate-mass black holes. However, HLXs are predominantly found in distant galaxies ( d ≳ 100 Mpc), where the chances of source confusion and misidentification with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or other transient X-ray phenomena are high. Aims. Our goal is to produce a clean sample of HLXs, by removing possible contaminants, and to characterise the spectral properties of the remaining population. This sample can then be used to determine whether different types of astrophysical objects coexist within the same class. Methods. Starting with a set of 115 HLXs detected by XMM-Newton , we identified and removed contaminants (AGNs, X-ray diffuse emission detected as point-like, and tidal disruption event candidates) and retrieved 40 sources for which XMM-Newton spectra are available. We fit them with an absorbed power law model and determined their unabsorbed luminosities and hardness ratios. We constructed the hardness-luminosity diagram and compared the results with the spectral properties of the HLX prototype, ESO 243-49 HLX-1. Then we conducted a deeper analysis on a selection of promising candidates. Results. The resulting HLX population spans a luminosity range from 1 × 10 41 erg s −1 to nearly 10 43 erg s −1 and is homogeneously spread in hardness between 0.5 and 5. Half of the population display hardness ratios higher than a typical AGN and could be considered an extension of the ULX population at higher energies. We found four very soft outliers, which are characterised by steep power law spectra and no X-ray emission above 1–2 keV, similarly to ESO 243-49 HLX-1. Those with multi-epoch archival data display changes in luminosity of up to nearly two orders in magnitude. Conclusions. We show that sources currently identified as HLXs can be more diverse than ULXs and disentangling among these different types of objects is not trivial with the data currently available. New observations would be beneficial to expand the current sample and uncover the true nature of many objects of this class, some of which show very similar characteristics to ESO 243-49 HLX-1.",Crossref,86.62420382165605,10.1051/0004-6361/202555122,https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202555122,2025.0,Goal 7,0.008425516496103968,False,

The XMM-Newton observatory has accumulated a vast archive of over 17 000 X-ray observations over the last 25 years. However, the standard data processing pipelines may fail to detect certain types of transient X-ray sources, due to their short-lived or dim nature. Identifying these transient sources is important for understanding the full range of temporal X-ray behaviour, as well as understanding the types of sources that could be routinely detected by future missions such as Athena . Aims. The aim of this work is to reprocess XMM-Newton archival observations using newly developed dedicated software in order to identify neglected and missed transient X-ray sources that were not detected by the existing pipeline. Methods. We used a new approach that builds upon previous methodologies, by transforming event lists into data cubes, which are then searched for transient variability in short time windows. Our method enhances the detection capabilities in the Poisson regime by accounting for the statistical properties of sparse count rates, and allowing the search for transients in previously discarded periods of high background activity. Results. Our reprocessing efforts identified 32 247 variable sources at the three-sigma level and 4083 sources at the five-sigma level in 12 926 XMM archival observations. We highlight four noteworthy sources: a candidate quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), a new magnetar candidate, a previously undetected Galactic hard X-ray burst, and a possible X-ray counterpart to a Galactic radio pulsar. Conclusions. Our method demonstrates a new, fast, and effective way to process event list data from XMM-Newton , which is efficient in finding rapid outburst-like or eclipsing behaviour.

Inferring spectral parameters from X-ray data is one of the cornerstones of high-energy astrophysics, and is achieved using software stacks that have been developed over the last 20 years and more. However, as models get more complex and spectra are obtained with higher resolutions, these established software solutions become more feature-heavy, difficult to maintain and less efficient. Aims. We present jaxspec , a Python package for performing this task quickly and robustly in a fully Bayesian framework. Based on the JAX ecosystem, jaxspec allows the generation of differentiable likelihood functions compilable on core or graphical process units (GPUs), enabling the use of robust algorithms for Bayesian inference. Methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of jaxspec samplers, in particular the no U-turn sampler, using a composite model and comparing what we obtain with the existing frameworks. We also demonstrate its ability to process high-resolution spectroscopy data using original methods by reproducing the results of the Hitomi collaboration on the Perseus cluster, while solving the inference problem using variational inference on a GPU. Results. We obtain identical results when compared to other software and approaches, meaning that jaxspec provides reliable results while being ~10 times faster than existing alternatives. In addition, we show that variational inference can produce convincing results even on high-resolution data in less than 10 minutes on a GPU. Conclusions. With this package, we aim to pursue the goal of opening up X-ray spectroscopy to the existing ecosystem of machine learning and Bayesian inference, enabling researchers to apply new methods to solve increasingly complex problems in the best possible way.

Over recent decades, astronomy has entered the era of massive data and real-time surveys. This is improving the study of transient objects – although they still contain some of the most poorly understood phenomena in astrophysics, as it is inherently more difficult to obtain data to constrain the proposed models. Aims. In order to help detect these objects in their brightest state and build synergies with multi-wavelength real-time surveys, we have built a quasi-real time automatic transient detection system for the XMM-Newton pipeline: the Search for Transient Objects in New detections using Known Sources (STONKS) pipeline. Methods. STONKS detects long-term X-ray transient events by automatically comparing new XMM-Newton detections to any available archival X-ray data at this position, sending out an alert if the variability between observations (defined as the ratio between the maximum flux and the minimum flux or upper limit) is over 5. This required an initial careful cross-correlation and flux calibration of various X-ray catalogs from different observatories ( XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift , ROSAT, and eROSITA). A Bayesian framework was put into place to solve any ambiguous associations. We also systematically computed the XMM-Newton upper limits at the position of any X-ray source covered by the XMM-Newton observational footprint, even without any XMM-Newton counterpart. The behavior of STONKS was then tested on all 483 observations performed with imaging mode in 2021. Results. Over the 2021 testing run, STONKS provided a daily alert rate of 0.7 −0.5 +0.7 alerts per day, about 80% of them corresponding to serendipitous sources. Among the detected variable serendipitous sources, there are: several highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and flaring stars, as well as new X-ray binary and ultra-luminous X-ray source candidates, some of which are present here. STONKS also detected targeted tidal disruption events, ensuring its ability to detect other serendipitous events. As a byproduct of our method, the archival multi-instrument catalog contains about one million X-ray sources, with 15% of them involving several catalogs and 60% of them having XMM-Newton (pointed or slew) upper limits. Conclusions. STONKS demonstrates a great potential for revealing future serendipitous transient X-ray sources, providing the community with the ability to follow-up on these objects a few days after their detection with the goal of obtaining a better understanding of their nature.

Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating thermal X-ray bursts associated with accreting massive black holes, the precise underlying physical mechanisms of which are still unclear. Aims. We present a new candidate QPE source, AT 2019vcb (nicknamed Tormund by the Zwicky Transient Facility Collaboration), which was found during an archival search for QPEs in the XMM-Newton archive. It was first discovered in 2019 as an optical tidal disruption event (TDE) at z = 0.088, and its X-ray follow-up exhibited QPE-like properties. Our goals are to verify its robustness as QPE candidate and to investigate its properties to improve our understanding of QPEs. Methods. We performed a detailed study of the X-ray spectral behaviour of this source over the course of the XMM-Newton archival observation. We also report on recent Swift and NICER follow-up observations to constrain the source’s current activity and overall lifetime, as well as an optical spectral follow-up. Results. The first two Swift detections and the first half of the 30 ks XMM-Newton exposure of Tormund displayed a decaying thermal emission typical of an X-ray TDE. However, the second half of the exposure showed a dramatic rise in temperature (from 53.5 −7.7 +9.2 eV to 113.8 −2.7 +2.9 eV) and 0.2–2 keV luminosity (from 3.2 −1.0 +1.6 × 10 42 erg s −1 to 1.19 −0.05 +0.05 × 10 44 erg s −1 ) over ∼15 ks. The late-time NICER follow-up indicates that the source is still X-ray bright more than three years after the initial optical TDE. Conclusions. Although only a rise phase was observed, Tormund’s strong similarities with a known QPE source (eRO-QPE1) and the impossibility to simultaneously account for all observational features with alternative interpretations allow us to classify Tormund as a candidate QPE. If confirmed as a QPE, it would further strengthen the observational link between TDEs and QPEs. It is also the first QPE candidate for which an associated optical TDE was directly observed, constraining the formation time of QPEs.",Crossref,94.94949494949495,10.1051/0004-6361/202346440,https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202346440,2023.0,Goal 13,0.003409818675820586,False,

It’s a distressing feeling for patients and continues to be the cause of postoperative complications such as bleeding, delayed healing, and wound infection. This scoping review aims to identify effective PONV prophylaxis strategies during orthognathic surgery that have emerged in the past 15 years. Methods We searched Pubmed, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, and Embase from 2008 to May 2023. Studies meeting the following criteria were eligible for inclusion: (1) recruited patients undergo any orthognathic surgery; (2) evaluated any pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic method to prevent PONV. Studies meeting the following criteria were excluded: (1) case series, review papers, or retrospective studies; (2) did not report our prespecified outcomes. Results Twenty-one studies were included in this review. Pharmacological methods for PONV prevention include ondansetron and dexamethasone (3 studies), peripheral nerve block technique (4 studies), dexmedetomidine (1 study), pregabalin (2 studies), nefopam (2 studies), remifentanil (1 study), propofol (2 studies), and penehyclidine (1 study). Non-pharmacologic methods include capsicum plaster (1 study), throat packs (2 studies) and gastric aspiration (2 studies). Conclusions Based on current evidence, we conclude that prophylactic antiemetics like dexamethasone, ondansetron, and penehyclidine are the first defense against PONV. Multimodal analgesia with nerve block techniques and non-opioid analgesics should be considered due to their notable opioid-sparing and PONV preventive effect. For the non-pharmacological methods, throat packs are not recommended for routine use because of their poor effect and serious complications. More prospective RCTs are required to confirm whether gastric aspiration can prevent PONV effectively for patients undergoing orthognathic surgery.",Semantic Scholar,20.0,10.1186/s12871-024-02510-z,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59d63eb6a1f8fdf43958f37c4acb8f3b60525198,2024.0,Goal 16,0.008114797116802453,False,

Experts remain concerned that nonmeritorious securities class actions—those that will be dismissed or settled for nuisance amounts—cause reputational damage. Although several prior studies show reputational costs for nonmeritorious cases, they generally use indirect measures based on returns or total market losses, which are mechanically associated with securities litigation elements. In contrast, we use a relatively direct reputation measure from Fortune 's “Most Admired Companies” list. We find significant reputational damage after meritorious litigation, with the strongest cases having the largest effects. However, we find no evidence of reputational damage after nonmeritorious litigation. We also find that Fortune 's reputational damage measure is associated with more negative returns around the litigation filing date. We show possible mechanisms for our results, as initial legal filings contain information allowing market participants to assess case merits. Our results imply that reputational damage is primarily due to fraud, which securities litigation helps reveal to the market, rather than litigation itself. Thus, reputational damage is not an issue in over 70% of securities class actions due to the high frequency of nonmeritorious cases.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1911-3846.12907,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12907,2023.0,Goal 17,0.007081955363394872,False,

Specifically, we explore the factors associated with shareholder tax litigation and its effect on the future tax behavior of the sued firm and its peers. We find that sued firms have lower cash and GAAP effective tax rates (ETRs) and engage in extreme tax avoidance before litigation. After litigation, they decrease tax avoidance activities, relative to matched control firms. Peer firms in the same industry as sued firms similarly reduce their level of tax avoidance and the likelihood of extreme tax avoidance after the litigation, relative to control firms. Additional analyses suggest that sued firms change their tax avoidance behavior, rather than merely their tax financial reporting. Finally, the spillover results are strongest for peer firms with the most tax avoidance (i.e., the lowest cash ETRs) when the sued firm's alleged misconduct is revealed.This article is protected by copyright.

Stock option backdating provides a unique opportunity to study this issue because it is possible to estimate misstatements with publicly available information to a high level of confidence, and the extensive media coverage of backdating notified boards of directors of the significant risk of misstatement. After identifying firms that materially misstated earnings due to stock option backdating with 95 percent (99 percent) probability, we find that only 11.5 percent (16.1 percent) of these firms subsequently restated. Restating firms are larger, have greater board independence, higher litigation risk and ROA, a lower market‐to‐book ratio, less discretionary accruals, and are more likely to have a CFO that was not involved in backdating. Restating firms are also more likely to disclose other adverse news, face securities litigation, and turn over the CFO than firms that appear to materially backdate but do not restate.

The question of how to maximise engagement within this core frontline, often semi-skilled, workforce is therefore crucial, and it cannot necessarily be approached in the same way as a white-collar, highly educated workforce.

Using a sample of insurance claims from about 500 plans, I find that in HMOs, spending on anti-cholesterol drugs is 19% lower than in other insurance plans. This spending difference could reflect the strong cost-control incentives generated by capitation, but it could also reflect the selection of healthy, price-sensitive patients into HMOs, or it could simply reflect lower prices. To understand the difference, I estimate a model of physician prescribing and patient refill decisions. Patients in HMOs are nearly twice as sensitive to copays as are other patients, consistent with selection of healthy patients into HMOs. Even after adjusting for this selection, however, HMO physicians remain highly sensitive to drug procurement costs.

Under prior guidance (SFAS 13), we predict and find firms with high financing cost sensitivities to leverage have greater incentive to finance investments with operating leases. Under the new lease accounting standard (ASU 2016-02), we predict and find this leverage incentive remains but is reduced, consistent with the FASB’s objective to limit opportunities to structure lease contracts for balance sheet purposes. Under ASU 2016-02, we also predict and find that the leverage incentive encourages firms to reduce operating lease liabilities by decreasing the duration of minimum lease payments. Lastly, we predict and find that firms use fewer operating leases under both SFAS 13 and ASU 2016-02 when managers’ income objectives exclude depreciation and/or interest expense. These findings suggest reporting incentives remain post ASU 2016-02 that encourage firms to structure leases to achieve accounting outcomes.

We predicted that mate change is a stressful event with impacts on health condition and those effects are higher during unfavorable years with food depletion. Our study showed that gannets changing mate increase parental effort only during years of low food abundance, with consequences on health condition (increased body mass loss, higher protein catabolism and higher oxidative damage during chick rearing period).

For example, divorce has been proposed to be an adaptive behavioral strategy in social monogamous species, as a response to poor conditions and low breeding success. Here, we studied divorce at the population and individual levels in northern gannets ( Morus bassanus , hereafter gannets) nesting on Bonaventure island (Quebec, Canada). At the population level, we used Granger’s method for detecting and quantifying temporal causality between time series (from 2009 to 2019) of divorce rate and breeding success of gannets ( n = 809) and we evaluated the relationship between breeding success and biomass of their two principal prey (Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus , and Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus ). Our results indicated that breeding success is mainly influenced by the spawning-stock biomass of Atlantic mackerel, and a decrease in breeding success is followed by an increase in divorce rate with a 1-year lag. However, the effect of the interaction between breeding success and year on the proportion of individuals that divorced showed significant inter-annual variation. At the individual level, our results support the adaptive strategy hypothesis of divorce. Indeed, gannets that changed partners did so following a reproductive failure, and there was an increase in breeding success 1 year following the divorce. Being central place foragers, opportunities for dispersal and adaptation are often limited for breeding seabirds in a context of low food abundance.

The study of differential migration offers unique opportunities to identify such mechanisms and allows comparisons of the costs and benefits of migration. The purpose of this study was to compare the characteristics of short and long-distance migrations, and fitness consequences, in a long-lived seabird species. We combined demographic monitoring (survival, phenology, hatching success) of 58 Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) breeding on Bonaventure Island (Canada) and biologging technology (Global Location Sensor or GLS loggers) to estimate activity and energy budgets during the non-breeding period for three different migration strategies: to the Gulf of Mexico (GM), southeast (SE) or northeast (NE) Atlantic coast of the U.S. Survival, timing of arrival at the colony and hatching success are similar for short (NE, SE) and long-distance (GM) migrants. Despite similar fitness consequences, we found, as expected, that the overall energetic cost of migration is higher for long-distance migrants, although the daily cost during migration was similar between strategies. In contrast, daily maintenance and thermoregulation costs were lower for GM migrants in winter, where sea-surface temperature of the GM is 4-7o C warmer than SE and NE. In addition, GM migrants tend to fly 30 min less per day in their wintering area than other migrants. Considering lower foraging effort and lower thermoregulation costs during winter for long-distance migrants, this suggests that the energetic benefits during the winter of foraging in the GM outweigh any negative consequences of the longer-distance migration.

Information on connectivity over large areas with high resolution source information provides for both local detail and regional context. The emerging capacity to apply circuit theory to create maps of omnidirectional connectivity provides an opportunity for improved and quantitative depictions of forest connectivity, supporting the formation and testing of hypotheses about the density of animal movement, ecosystem structure, and related links to natural and anthropogenic forces. In this research, our goal was to delineate regions where connectivity regimes are similar across the boreal region of Canada using new quantitative analyses for characterizing connectivity over large areas (e.g., millions of hectares). Utilizing the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of forests (EOSD) circa 2000 Landsat-derived land-cover map, we created and analyzed a national-scale map of omnidirectional forest connectivity at 25m resolution over 10000 tiles of 625 km2 each, spanning the forested regions of Canada. Using image recognition software to detect corridors, pinch points, and barriers to movements at multiple spatial scales in each tile, we developed a simple measure of the structural complexity of connectivity patterns in omnidirectional connectivity maps. We then mapped the Circuitscape resistance distance measure and used it in conjunction with the complexity data to study connectivity characteristics in each forested ecozone. Ecozone boundaries masked substantial systematic patterns in connectivity characteristics that are uncovered using a new classification of connectivity patterns that revealed six clear groups of forest connectivity patterns found in Canada. The resulting maps allow exploration of omnidirectional forest connectivity patterns at full resolution while permitting quantitative analyses of connectivity over broad areas, informing modeling, planning and monitoring efforts.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0169428,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00767a32f008089806a288ee1ef424dd1ca3a2d1,2017.0,Goal 15,0.0852153329918488,True,forest ecosystems; terrestrial ecosystems

This increased muscle work rate can manifest itself in core body temperature (Tb) increase of 1–2°C in birds during flight. Therefore, episodic body cooling may be mandatory in migratory birds. To elucidate the thermoregulatory strategy of a short-distance migrant, common eiders (Somateria mollissima), we implanted data loggers in the body cavity of wild birds for 1 year, and report information on Tb during their entire migration for 19 individuals. We show that the mean body temperature during flight (TbMean) in the eiders was associated with rises in Tb ranging from 0.2 to 1.5°C, largely depending on flight duration. To understand how eiders are dealing with hyperthermia during migration, we first compare, at a daily scale, how Tb differs during migration using a before-after approach. Only a slight difference was found (0.05°C) between the after (40.30°C), the before (40.41°C) and the migration (40.36°C) periods, indicating that hyperthermia during flight had minimal impact at this time scale. Analyses at the scale of a flight cycle (flight plus stops on the water), however, clearly shows that eiders were closely regulating Tb during migration, as the relationship between the storage of heat during flight was highly correlated (slope = 1) with the level of heat dumping during stops, at both inter-individual and intra-individual levels. Because Tb at the start of a flight (TbStart) was significantly and positively related to Tb at the end of a flight (TbEnd), and the maximal attained Tb during a flight (TbMax), we conclude that in absence of sufficient body cooling during stopovers, eiders are likely to become increasingly hyperthermic during migration. Finally, we quantified the time spent cooling down during migration to be 36% of their daily (24 h) time budget, and conclude that behavioral body cooling in relation to hyperthermia represents an important time cost.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.3389/fphys.2017.00532,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d07361ba65ffd2b10764e874b3261a9a0c5a053,2017.0,Goal 10,0.037702045750356,False,

Short‐range connectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases recolonization of habitat fragments. Long‐range connectivity across habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate‐driven range shifts. We present a method for identifying a multipurpose network of forest patches that promotes both short‐ and long‐range connectivity. Our method uses both graph‐theoretic analyses that quantify network connectedness and circuit‐based analyses that quantify network traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities on the landscape. We illustrate our approach in the agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain ranges, that surrounds the metropolis of Montreal, Canada. We established forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in our study area. All connectivity analyses were based on the same empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels that facilitated short‐ and long‐range connectivity requirements had low spatial correlation. The trade‐off between connectivity requirements in the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional conservation of long‐range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on the conservation of short‐range connectivity. Highest conservation priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered throughout the study area that provide connectivity within the agroecosystem. Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many species. Our approach can be tailored to local, regional and continental conservation initiatives to protect essential species movements that will allow biodiversity to persist in a changing climate.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/2041-210x.12470,https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.12470,2015.0,Goal 15,0.1763787927111695,True,biodiversity conservation; biodiversity loss; forest conservation; global biodiversity; global biodiversity crisis; habitat degradation; local communities and conservation; wildlife conservation

Here, we test the idea that hyperthermia might constrain flight duration (FD) in a short-distance migrant using remote biologging technology to measure heart rate, hydrostatic pressure and body temperature in 19 migrating eider ducks ( Somateria mollissima ), a short-distance migrant. Our results reveal a stop-and-go migration strategy where migratory flights were frequent (14 flights day −1 ) and short (15.7 min), together with the fact that body temperature increases by 1°C, on average, during such flights, which equates to a rate of heat storage index (HSI) of 4°C h −1 . Furthermore, we could not find any evidence that short flights were limited by heart rate, together with the fact that the numerous stops could not be explained by the need to feed, as the frequency of dives and the time spent feeding were comparatively small during the migratory period. We thus conclude that hyperthermia appears to be the predominant determinant of the observed migration strategy, and suggest that such a physiological limitation to FD may also occur in other species.

Instead of assuming a normal distribution with an unknown population average and standard deviation level of skill, in this paper, investors are initially ignorant about how mutual fund skill is distributed but learn about it from the performance history of existing mutual funds. As a panel of fund returns is observed, our investor reduces his level of ignorance by grouping together similarly skilled funds into sub-populations where the funds belonging to a particular sub-population all have the same average level of ability and variation around this average ability. Applying this Bayesian learning to the gross returns of a panel of 5,136 domestic equity, mutual funds, our investor finds the skill level among mutual funds to be distributed across three distinct sub-populations each with a different average level of performance and variance. The sub-population with the lowest probability of occurrence is a group whose average performance exceeds a passive four-factor portfolio by approximately six percent per annum. The next most likely sub-population is a group of funds who on average underperform the passive portfolio by 0.4 percent a year. The third and most probable group beats the passive portfolio by roughly the average fee charge by a fund by returning its investors on average 1.8 percent a year.

Using videos of structured interviews of candidates and judgements on standard performance criteria by multiple recruiting experts, we develop an AI prediction model of salesforce “skill” by extracting theory-relevant objective measures of interviewee performance embedded in videos. Using the model, we address two issues: First, to aid interpretability of the AI model, we assess what mode of unstructured data from the interview (text, audio and video information) and what specific behaviors (eg, certain body language or style of conversation) drive AI performance. We find that “interactive conversations” as measured by the number of back and forth between buyer and seller from video data and “willingness to listen” as measured by share of buyer speaking time and the ability to handle buyer objections are most predictive of interviewee sales skills. Second, while research has suggested that AI can serve to augment human decision making, there is relatively limited work on how AI-human hybrid models together improve performance on tasks. We use a Bayesian approach to combine AI prediction with human judgments and we assess predictive performance of the hybrid AI-human model with respect to a pure human panel benchmark. We find that human judgement has limited incremental benefit over AI for screening but improves selection significantly.

Carotid artery webs (CaW) are non-inflammatory intraluminal shelf-like projections into the internal carotid artery (ICA) bulb that are associated with complex flow and cryptogenic stroke.
Optimize 4D flow MRI for measuring the velocity field of complex flow in the carotid artery bifurcation model that contains a CaW.
A 3D printed phantom model created from computed tomography angiography (CTA) of a subject with CaW was placed in a pulsatile flow loop within the MRI scanner. 4D Flow MRI images of the phantom were acquired with five different spatial resolutions (0.50–2.00 mm3) and four different temporal resolutions (23–96 ms) and compared to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution of the flow field as a reference. We examined four planes perpendicular to the vessel centerline, one in the common carotid artery (CCA) and three in the internal carotid artery (ICA) where complex flow was expected. At these four planes pixel-by-pixel velocity values, flow, and time average wall shear stress (TAWSS) were compared between 4D flow MRI and CFD.
An optimized 4D flow MRI protocol will provide a good correlation with CFD velocity and TAWSS values in areas of complex flow within a clinically feasible scan time (~ 10 min).
Spatial resolution affected the velocity values, time average flow, and TAWSS measurements. Qualitatively, a spatial resolution of 0.50 mm3 resulted in higher noise, while a lower spatial resolution of 1.50–2.00 mm3 did not adequately resolve the velocity profile. Isotropic spatial resolutions of 0.50–1.00 mm3 showed no significant difference in total flow compared to CFD. Pixel-by-pixel velocity correlation coefficients between 4D flow MRI and CFD were > 0.75 for 0.50–1.00 mm3 but were < 0.5 for 1.50 and 2.00 mm3. Regional TAWSS values determined from 4D flow MRI were generally lower than CFD and decreased at lower spatial resolutions (larger pixel sizes). TAWSS differences between 4D flow and CFD were not statistically significant at spatial resolutions of 0.50–1.00 mm3 but were different at 1.50 and 2.00 mm3. Differences in temporal resolution only affected the flow values when temporal resolution was > 48.4 ms; temporal resolution did not affect TAWSS values.
A spatial resolution of 0.74–1.00 mm3 and a temporal resolution of 23–48 ms (1–2 k-space segments) provides a 4D flow MRI protocol capable of imaging velocity and TAWSS in regions of complex flow within the carotid bifurcation at a clinically acceptable scan time.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),87.4074074074074,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13239-023-00667-1,2023.0,Goal 16,0.01734898533784263,False,

Standard of care involves intensive supportive therapy to prevent secondary injury. To date, there is no randomized control study demonstrating benefit of early evacuation of supratentorial ICH. Methods The Early Minimally Invasive Removal of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ENRICH) Trial was designed to evaluate the minimally invasive trans-sulcal parafascicular surgery (MIPS) approach, a technique for safe access to deep brain structures and ICH removal using the BrainPath ® and Myriad ® devices (NICO Corporation, Indianapolis, IN). ENRICH is a multi-centered, two-arm, randomized, adaptive comparative-effectiveness study, where patients are block randomized by ICH location and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) to early ICH evacuation using MIPS plus standard guideline-based management vs. standard management alone to determine if MIPS results in improved outcomes defined by the utility-weighted modified Rankin score (UWmRS) at 180 days as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include clinical and economic outcomes of MIPS using cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The inclusion and exclusion criteria aim to capture a broad group of patients with high risk of significant morbidity and mortality to determine optimal treatment strategy. Discussion ENRICH will result in improved understanding of the benefit of MIPS for both lobar and deep ICH affecting the basal ganglia. The ongoing study will lead to Level-I evidence to guide clinicians treatment options in the management of acute treatment of ICH.

Early triage and treatment after TBI have been shown to improve outcome. Identifying patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) via baseline computed tomography (CT) , however, has not been validated previously in a prospective dataset. We hypothesized that acute CT findings of elevated ICP, combined with direct ICP measurement, hold prognostic value in terms of six-month patient outcome after TBI. Data were obtained from the Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury, Experimental Clinical Treatment (ProTECTIII) multi-center clinical trial. Baseline CT scans for 881 participants were individually reviewed by a blinded central neuroradiologist. Five signs of elevated ICP were measured (sulcal obliteration, lateral ventricle compression, third ventricle compression, midline shift, and herniation). Associations between signs of increased ICP and outcomes (six-month functional outcome and death) were assessed. Secondary analyses of 354 patients with recorded ICP monitoring data available explored the relationships between hemorrhage phenotype/anatomic location, sustained ICP ≥20 mm Hg, and surgical intervention(s). Univariate and multi-variate logistic/linear regressions were performed; p < 0.05 is defined as statistically significant. Imaging characteristics associated with ICP in this cohort include sulcal obliteration (p = 0.029) and third ventricular compression (p = 0.039). Univariate regression analyses indicated that increasing combinations of the five defined signs of elevated ICP were associated with death, poor functional outcome, and time to death. There was also an increased likelihood of death if patients required craniotomy (odds ratio [OR] = 4.318, 95% confidence interval [1.330–16.030]) or hemicraniectomy (OR = 2.993 [1.109–8.482]). On multi-variate regression analyses, hemorrhage location was associated with death (posterior fossa, OR = 3.208 [1.120–9.188] and basal ganglia, OR = 3.079 [1.178–8.077]). Volume of hemorrhage >30 cc was also associated with increased death, OR = 3.702 [1.575–8.956]). The proportion of patient hours with sustained ICP ≥20 mm Hg, and maximum ICP ≥20 mm Hg were also directly correlated with increased death (OR = 6 4.99 [7.731–635.51]; and OR = 1.025 [1.004–1.047]), but not with functional outcome. Poor functional outcome was predicted by concurrent presence of all five radiographic signs of elevated ICP (OR = 4.44 [1.514–14.183]) and presence of frontal lobe (OR = 2.951 [1.265–7.067]), subarachnoid (OR = 2.231 [1.067–4.717]), or intraventricular (OR = 2.249 [1.159–4.508]) hemorrhage. Time to death was modulated by total patient days of elevated ICP ≥20 mm Hg (effect size = 3.424 [1.500, 5.439]) in the first two weeks of hospitalization. Sulcal obliteration and third ventricular compression, radiographic signs of elevated ICP, were significantly associated with measurements of ICP ≥20 mm Hg.

We propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach for QSM with built‐in parameter estimation, and incorporate the nonlinear formulation of the dipole inversion to achieve a robust recovery of the susceptibility maps. Theory From a Bayesian perspective, the image wavelet coefficients are approximately sparse and modeled by the Laplace distribution. The measurement noise is modeled by a Gaussian‐mixture distribution with two components, where the second component is used to model the noise outliers. Through probabilistic inference, the susceptibility map and distribution parameters can be jointly recovered using approximate message passing (AMP). Methods We compare our proposed AMP with built‐in parameter estimation (AMP‐PE) to the state‐of‐the‐art L1‐QSM, FANSI, and MEDI approaches on the simulated and in vivo datasets, and perform experiments to explore the optimal settings of AMP‐PE. Reproducible code is available at: https://github.com/EmoryCN2L/QSM_AMP_PE . Results On the simulated Sim2Snr1 dataset, AMP‐PE achieved the lowest NRMSE, deviation from calcification moment and the highest SSIM, while MEDI achieved the lowest high‐frequency error norm. On the in vivo datasets, AMP‐PE is robust and successfully recovers the susceptibility maps using the estimated parameters, whereas L1‐QSM, FANSI and MEDI typically require additional visual fine‐tuning to select or double‐check working parameters.

Using case examples, this article aims to familiarize the general radiologist with interpreting automated CTP software data output in the context of contemporary stroke management, providing a discussion of CTP acquisition and postprocessing, a stepwise guide for CTP quality assurance and troubleshooting, and a framework for avoiding clinically significant CTP interpretative pitfalls in commonly encountered clinical scenarios. Interpreting radiologists should apply the outlined approach for quality assurance and develop a comprehensive search pattern for the identified pitfalls, to ensure accurate CTP interpretation and optimize patient selection for reperfusion.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2214/ajr.21.26139,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/362a696539dac1afc3bd17074f4505fc1b13eef1,2021.0,Goal 17,0.00311673835314361,False,

Clinical vestibular syndromes may perturb this network, resulting in deficits across a variety of functional domains. Here, we leverage structural and functional neuroimaging to characterize this extended network in healthy control participants and patients with post‐concussive vestibular dysfunction (PCVD). Then, 27 healthy control subjects (15 females) and 18 patients with subacute PCVD (12 female) were selected for participation. Eighty‐two regions of interest (network nodes) were identified based on previous publications, group‐wise differences in BOLD signal amplitude and connectivity, and multivariate pattern analysis on affective tests. Group‐specific “core” networks, as well as a “consensus” network comprised of connections common to all participants, were then generated based on probabilistic tractography and functional connectivity between the 82 nodes and subjected to analyses of node centrality and community structure. Whereas the consensus network was comprised of affective, integrative, and vestibular nodes, PCVD participants exhibited diminished integration and centrality among vestibular and affective nodes and increased centrality of visual, supplementary motor, and frontal and cingulate eye field nodes. Clinical outcomes, derived from dynamic posturography, were associated with approximately 62% of all connections but best predicted by amygdalar, prefrontal, and cingulate connectivity. No group‐wise differences in diffusion metrics or tractography were noted.

 We aimed to assess early COVID-19 pandemic-associated changes in brain MRI examination frequency and acuity of imaging findings acuity.
 
 Methods
 Using a natural language processing model, we retrospectively categorized reported findings of 12,346 brain MRI examinations performed during 6-month pre-pandemic and early pandemic time periods across a large metropolitan health system into three acuity levels: 1, normal or near normal; 2, incidental or chronic findings not requiring a management change; and 3, new or progressive findings requiring a management change. Brain MRI frequency and imaging finding acuity level were compared over time.
 
 Results
 Between March and August of 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (early pandemic), our health system brain MRI examination volumes decreased 17.0% (6,745 vs. 5,601). Comparing calendar-matched 6-month periods, the proportion of higher acuity findings increased significantly (p <0.001) from pre-pandemic (22.5%, 43.6% and 34.0% in acuity level 1, 2, and 3, respectively) to early pandemic periods (19.1%, 40.9%, and 40.1%). During the second three months of the early pandemic period, as MRI volumes recovered to near baseline, the proportion of higher acuity findings remained high (42.6% vs. 34.1%) compared with a similar pre-pandemic period. In a multivariable analysis, Black (B coefficient, 0.16) and underinsured population (B coefficient, 0.33) presented with higher acuity findings (p < 0.05).

 As the volume of brain MRI examinations decreased during the early COVID-19 pandemic, the relative proportion of examinations with higher acuity findings increased significantly.

It is overlooked as a separate entity and often dismissed if no coexistent signs of classic FMD changes are observed. We aim to evaluate the frequency of classic FMD in high-yield vascular territories in patients with symptomatic CaW. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of a symptomatic CaW database of 2 comprehensive stroke centers (spanning September 2014–October 2020). The diagnosis of a CaW during a stroke workup was defined as the presence of a shelf-like linear filling defect in the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb on computed tomography angiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of undetermined cause after a thorough evaluation. Neck computed tomography angiography and renal conventional angiography images were independently evaluated by two readers blinded to the laterality and clinical details to inspect the presence of underlying classic FMD. Results: Sixty-six patients with CaW were identified. Median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 42–57), and 74% were women. All patients had neck computed tomography angiography (allowing for bilateral vertebral and carotid evaluation), whereas 47 patients had additional digital subtraction angiography (which evaluated 47 carotids ipsilateral to the stroke and 10 contralateral carotids).

Before and after the 8-week meditation period, we acquired fMRI scans of participants’ resting state, and participants completed a self-report measure of mindfulness. We used a 2 × 2, within- and between-group factorial design and leveraged a whole-brain connectome approach to examine changes in within- and between-network connectivity across the entire brain, and to examine whether changes in connectivity were associated with app use or to changes in self-reported mindfulness. Results Meditation practitioners exhibited significantly stronger connectivity between the frontoparietal network and the left and right nucleus accumbens and between the default mode (DMN) and salience networks, among other regions. Mindfulness practice time was correlated with increased connectivity between the lateral parietal cortex and the supramarginal gyrus, which were also positively correlated with increased scores on the “Describing” subscale of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire between baseline and post-meditation. These findings are consistent with previous research indicating that mindfulness-based interventions alter functional connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and other networks both during meditation and at rest, as well as increased connectivity in systems important for emotion and reward.

In subdural hematoma (SDH) >50cm3, ABC/2 and CAV produce significantly different volume measurements (p < 0.0001), although the difference was not significant for smaller SDH or intra-axial lesions. The disparity between ABC/2 and CAV measurements varied significantly with hematoma size for both intra- and extra-axial lesions (p < 0.0001). Across all lesions, volume was significantly associated with outcome using either method (p < 0.001), but CAV measurement was a significantly better predictor of outcome than ABC/2 estimation for SDH. Among large traumatic SDH, ABC/2 significantly overestimates lesion volume compared with measurement based on precise bleed topology. CAV also offers significantly better prediction of patient functional outcofme and mortality.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1089/neu.2020.7209,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d574135b27229f075a34667d32e7bbc40bbed1c,2020.0,Goal 3,0.01221831195992415,False,

The purpose of this article was to determine whether the radiographic and CT appearance of ballistic projectiles predicts their composition and to characterize the translational, rotational, and temperature effects of a 1.5-T MRI magnetic field on representative bullets. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Commercially available handgun and shotgun ammunition representing projectiles commonly encountered in a clinical setting was fired into ballistic gelatin as a surrogate for human tissue, and radiographs and CT images of these gelatin blocks were obtained. MR images of unfired bullets suspended in gelatin blocks were also obtained using T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Magnetic attractive force, rotational torque, and heating effects of unfired bullets were assessed at 1.5 T. RESULTS. Fired bullets were separated into ferromagnetic and nonferromagnetic groups based on the presence of a debris trail and deformation of the primary projectile in the gelatin blocks. Whereas ferromagnetic bullets showed mild torque forces and marked imaging artifacts at 1.5 T, nonferromagnetic bullets did not have these effects. Heating above the Food and Drug Administration limit of 2°C was not observed in any of the projectiles tested. CONCLUSION. Patients with ballistic embedded fragments are frequently denied MRI because the bullet composition cannot be determined without shell casings. We found that radiography and CT can be used to identify nonferromagnetic projectiles that are safe for MRI. We also present an algorithm for determining the triage of patients with retained bullets.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2214/ajr.20.23648,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45b92880fb530ab4eded1034d97342346f3bb37e,2020.0,Goal 2,0.02612156101685014,False,

Identifying effective solutions and interventions to cultivate resilience among health care trainees is critical. Although less is known about the mental health needs of physician assistants (PAs) or PA students, accumulating research indicates that they experience similarly alarming rates of burnout, depression, and emotional exhaustion. Mobile app–delivered mindfulness meditation may be an effective part of salubrious programming to bolster long-term resilience and health among PA students. Objective This study aims to examine the impact of app-delivered mindfulness meditation on self-reported mental health symptoms among PA students. A secondary aim is to investigate changes in brain connectivity to identify neurobiological changes related to changes in mental health symptoms. Methods We recruited PA students enrolled in their third semester of PA school and used a longitudinal, randomized, wait-list–controlled design. Participants randomized to the mindfulness group were provided 1-year subscriptions to the 10% Happier app, a consumer-based meditation app, and asked to practice every day for 8 weeks. Before randomization and again after completion of the 8-week program, all participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as self-report assessments of burnout, depression, anxiety, and sleep impairment. App use was acquired as a measure of mindfulness practice time. Results PA students randomized to the mindfulness group reported improvements in sleep impairment compared with those randomized to the wait-list control group (ηp2=0.42; P=.01). Sleep impairment decreased significantly in the mindfulness group (19% reduction; P=.006) but not in the control group (1% reduction; P=.71). There were no other significant changes in mental health for those randomized to app-delivered mindfulness. Across all students, changes in sleep impairment were associated with increased resting-state functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (a component of the default mode network) and the superior temporal gyrus, as well as between areas important for working memory. Changes in connectivity predicted categorical conversion from impaired to nonimpaired sleep in the mindfulness group. Conclusions This pilot study is the first to examine app-based mindfulness for PA students’ mental health and investigate the impact of mindfulness on PA students’ brain function. These findings suggest that app-delivered mindfulness may be an effective tool to improve sleep dysfunction and that it may be an important part of the programming necessary to reduce the epidemic of suffering among health profession trainees.",Crossref,100.0,10.2196/24208,https://doi.org/10.2196/24208,2021.0,Goal 3,0.1162842886099926,True,health resilience

The largest lesion was identified as IPH or contusion in 273 cases. Five subjects lost to follow-up were excluded. Volumes were estimated using ABC/2, and then by blinded research associates using CAVE (3D Slicer, v4. 5). The relationship between ABC/2 vs CAVE and outcomes, defined by mortality, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE-E), and Disability Rating Scale (DRS), was assessed using ordinal linear regression and area under the curve (AUC)(Python, v3. 6.5). 6-month disability was defined as GOSE≤ 5 or DRS≥ 6.
Results: Across 42 IPHs and 226 contusions, lesion volume was significantly related to outcome using both ABC/2 and CAVE: mortality (p< 0.0001), GOS-E (p< 0.0001), DRS (p< 0.001). Presence of edema was not associated with mortality (p= 0.47) or disability (p= 0.34). CAVE and ABC/2 methods were both predictive of mortality (AUC 0.715 vs 0.713, diff= 0.002, 95% CI [-0.046, 0.047]) and long-term disability (AUC 0.677 vs 0.678, diff= 0.001, 95% CI [-0.038, 0.047]), without significant differences between methods. However, CAVE was significantly more predictive of mortality in the contusion subgroup vs the IPH subgroup (AUC 0.724 vs 0.668, diff= 0.056, 95% CI [0.003, 0.117]), while ABC/2 was not (AUC 0.721 vs 0.699, diff= 0.022, 95% CI [-0.002, 0.088]).
Conclusions: The prognostic value of CAVE does not differ significantly from that of ABC/2 within analyses across intra-axial lesion subtypes.

We aimed to assess the detectability of cortical and deep GM MS lesions using DIR and FLAIR on 3T clinical exams and evaluate the relationship between deep GM lesions and brain atrophy. METHODS One hundred fifty consecutive MS patients underwent routine brain MRI that included 3D DIR and 2D T2 FLAIR on the same 3T scanner. Three neuroradiologists independently reviewed all exams for cortical and deep GM lesions. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and FMRIB software library (FSL)‐FIRST pipelines were used to determine normalized whole brain and deep GM volumes. RESULTS A total of 65 cortical and 98 deep lesions were detected on DIR versus 24 and 20, respectively, on FLAIR. Among all 150 patients, the number and percentage of patients with GM lesions on DIR and FLAIR were as follows: cortical 43 (28.7%) versus 24 (16.0%) ( P P P = .02), globus pallidus 9 (6.0%) versus 3 (1.3%) ( P = .02), and caudate 5 (3.3%) versus 1 (0.7%) ( P = .125).

This study describes a scoring system designed to communicate the potential need for surgical decompression in TBI patients. The scoring system, named the Surgical Intervention for Traumatic Injury (SITI), was designed to be objective and easy to use. Methods The SITI scale uses radiographic and clinical findings, including the Glasgow Coma Scale Score, pupil examination, and findings noted on computed tomography. To examine the scale, we used the patient database for the Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury III (ProTECT III) trial, and retrospectively applied the SITI scale to these patients. Results Of the 871 patients reviewed, 164 (18.8%) underwent craniotomy or craniectomy, and 707 (81.2%) were treated nonoperatively. The mean SITI score was 5.1 for patients who underwent surgery and 2.5 for patients treated nonoperatively (P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.887. Conclusion The SITI scale was designed to be a simple, objective, clinical decision tool regarding the potential need for surgical decompression after TBI. Application of the SITI scale to the ProTECT III database demonstrated that a score of 3 or more was well associated with a perceived need for surgical decompression.

OBJECTIVE To assess the utilization rate and diagnostic yield of imaging tests routinely obtained in identifying a structural cause for AN-SAH. METHODS In this retrospective multicenter study, consecutive adult patients admitted with nontraumatic, AN-SAH between 01/2010 and 12/2015 were included. Patients with intraparenchymal, subdural, or epidural hematomas in addition to SAH were excluded. Outcomes studied included utilization rate, diagnostic yield, and median time from admission for the following imaging tests: initial computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and any repeat DSA or CTA performed either during initial admission or at long-term follow-up. RESULTS A total of 752 patients were included (mean age, 53 yr; 54% male). Initial CTA and DSA were performed in 89% and 100% of patients, respectively. Brain MRI was performed in 75% of patients and was positive in 0.7% of cases. Cervical spine MRI was performed in 61% of patients and was positive in 0.2% of cases.

Purpose To explore QSM oximetry during acetazolamide (ACZ) challenge, hypothesizing that detectable OEF alterations will reflect hemodynamic compromise in unilateral cerebrovascular disease (CVD) patients. Study Type Retrospective. Subjects Fourteen unilateral CVD patients, and 24 healthy controls (HC). Field Strength/Sequence Multiecho gradient echo (GRE) and T 1 ‐weighted images at 3T. Assessment We constructed QSM images and R2* maps from multiecho GRE images. QSM‐OEF maps were generated from the susceptibility difference between venous blood and background brain tissue. Intrasubject diseased/contralateral hemisphere OEF ratios in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories were calculated. Intravascular susceptibility in the straight sinus (SS) and MCA was also measured. Statistical Tests The result significance was determined using t ‐tests and Pearson's correlation. Results Mean and standard deviation for the patient diseased/contralateral OEF ratios were 1.15 ± 0.14 at baseline and 1.23 ± 0.17 post‐ACZ. Disease group R2* ratios were 0.95 ± 0.05 at baseline and 1.03 ± 0.08 post‐ACZ. Left/right OEF and R2* ratios for the HC group were 0.98 ± 0.06 and 0.99 ± 0.038, respectively.

Although MCI may be subdivided into amnestic or vascular types as well as into single or multiple cognitive domain involvement, most prior studies using advanced diffusion imaging have not accounted for these categories. The purpose of the current study was to determine if the pattern of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics in patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) correlate to specific cognitive domain impairments. METHODS Nineteen consecutive patients with aMCI referred for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included. All subjects underwent neurocognitive testing. A z ‐score was calculated for each domain and a composite of all four domains. Brain MRI included standard structural imaging and diffusion imaging. Volumetric, DTI, and DKI metrics were calculated and statistical analysis was performed with adjustments for multiple measures and comparisons. RESULTS Statistically significant correlations between diffusion metrics and cognitive z ‐scores were detected: visuospatial‐visuoconstructional z ‐scores only correlated with alterations in the corpus callosum splenium, executive functioning z ‐scores with the corpus callosum genu, memory testing z ‐scores with the left hippocampus, and composite z ‐scores with the anterior centrum semiovale. CONCLUSION Neuroimaging studies of patients with aMCI to date have assumed a population with homogeneous cognitive impairment. Our results demonstrate selective patterns of regional diffusion metric alterations correlate to specific cognitive domain impairments.

Common clinical decision tools for C-spine imaging in the setting of trauma include the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) and the Canadian Cervical Spine Rule for Radiography (CCR). While NEXUS and CCR have served to decrease the amount of unnecessary imaging of the C-spine, overutilization of CT is still of concern.MethodsA retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed of the electronic medical record (EMR) database at an urban, Level I Trauma Center over a 6-month period for patients receiving a C-spine CT. The primary outcome of interest was prevalence of cervical spine fracture. Secondary outcomes of interest included appropriateness of C-spine imaging after retrospective application of NEXUS and CCR. The hypothesis was that fracture rates within this patient population would be extremely low.ResultsNo C-spine fractures were identified in the 460 patients who met inclusion criteria. Approximately 29% of patients did not warrant imaging by CCR, and 25% by NEXUS. Of note, approximately 44% of patients were indeterminate for whether imaging was warranted by CCR, with the most common reason being lack of assessment for active neck rotation.ConclusionsCervical spine CT is overutilized in the setting of simple assault, despite established clinical decision rules. With no fractures identified regardless of other factors, the likelihood that a CT of the cervical spine will identify clinically significant findings in the setting of “simple” assault is extremely low, approaching zero.

This study assessed the added value of cervical spine MRI in identifying a cause for nontraumatic AN-SAH. METHODS Consecutive patients 18 years of age or older who presented with nontraumatic SAH between February 1, 2009, and October 31, 2014, with negative cerebrovascular catheter angiography and subsequent cervical MRI were studied. Patients with intraparenchymal, subdural, or epidural hemorrhage; recent trauma; or known vascular malformations were excluded. All cervical MR images were reviewed by two blinded neuroradiologists. The diagnostic yield of cervical MRI was calculated. A literature review was conducted to identify studies reporting the diagnostic yield of cervical MRI in patients with AN-SAH. The weighted pooled estimate of diagnostic yield of cervical MRI was calculated. RESULTS For all 240 patients (mean age 53 years, 48% male), catheter angiography was performed within 4 days after admission (median 12 hours, interquartile range [IQR] 10 hours). Cervical MRI was performed within 19 days of admission (median 24 hours, IQR 10 hours). In a single patient, cervical MRI identified a source for SAH (cervical vascular malformation).

The SITI scale ranks specific radiographic and clinical findings to assess the possible need for urgent surgical intervention. The scale includes: GCS (GCS> 12= 0 points, GCS 9-12= 1 point, and GCS< 9= 2 points), pupil examination (unilateral enlarged pupil= 2 points), computed tomography findings (midline shift< 5 mm= 0 points, 5-10 mm= 2 points, and> 10 mm= 4 points), the presence of temporal pathology (1 point), and epidural hematoma (hematoma= 10 mm= 2 points). To validate the scale, the patient database for the Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury III Trial (PROTECT III) was used, and 871 patients were included in the analysis. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ie area under the curve analysis) to further validate the SITI scale.
RESULTS:
Of the 871 patients reviewed, 159 underwent craniotomy, and 712 were treated nonoperatively. The mean SITI score was 5.3 for operative patients and 2.4 for nonoperative patients (P<. 001). We found that, applying a cutoff at a SITI score of 3 or greater, resulted in an area under the curve of 0.887.
CONCLUSION:
The SITI scale was designed to be a simple, objective system for communication between clinical services regarding the potential need for surgical decompression for TBI. Application of the SITI scale to the PROTECT III database demonstrates that a SITI score of 3 or more correlated well with the patient receiving a craniotomy.

METHODS
Retrospective cross-sectional study of 3,753 consecutive adult patients presenting to an urban Level I emergency department who received C-spine CT scans were obtained over a 6-month period.

Emerging paradigms propose patient subselection using imaging biomarkers derived from CT, CTA, and CT perfusion. We evaluated the performance of a fully-automated computational tool, hypothesizing enhancements compared with qualitative approaches. The correlation between imaging variables and clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke is reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with acute ischemic stroke and MCA or ICA occlusion undergoing multidetector CT, CTA, and CTP were retrospectively evaluated. CTP was processed on a fully operator-independent platform (RApid processing of PerfusIon and Diffusion [RAPID]) computing automated core estimates based on relative cerebral blood flow and relative cerebral blood volume and hypoperfused tissue volumes at varying thresholds of time-to-maximum. Qualitative analysis was assigned by 2 independent reviewers for each variable, including CT-ASPECTS, CBV-ASPECTS, CBF-ASPECTS, CTA collateral score, and CTA clot burden score. Performance as predictors of favorable clinical outcome and final infarct volume was established for each variable. RESULTS: Both RAPID core estimates, CT-ASPECTS, CBV-ASPECTS, and clot burden score correlated with favorable clinical outcome (P < .05); CBF-ASPECTS and collateral score were not significantly associated with favorable outcome, while hypoperfusion estimates were variably associated, depending on the selected time-to-maximum thresholds. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated disparities among tested variables, with RAPID core and hypoperfusion estimates outperforming all qualitative approaches (area under the curve, relative CBV = 0.86, relative CBF = 0.81; P < .001).

The impact of counterfeit products in online marketplace remains largely unexplored, in part due to the difficulty of identifying fake items. By leveraging public sales and review data on Amazon, we apply natural language processing techniques to extract the likelihood of encountering a counterfeit product when purchasing from an Amazon ASIN listing. We focus on two product categories, men’s fragrance and cell phone wireless chargers, both of which are known to be significantly impacted by online counterfeiting. We adopt a BLP-type choice model with random coefficients to investigate how the probability of a counterfeit product encounter affects user demand, and how the intensity of counterfeiting affects the demand for likely authentic products.

The Impact of Carpool on Ride-hailing Platforms","The introduction of a new product to existing product lines typically gives rise to two opposing effects to the firm–market expansion (eg obtain more market shares from competitors or create new demand) and cannibalization (eg competition with other products offered by the same firm). However, in a multi-sided network, effects of new product introduction may become more substantiated or complex due to network effects. In this study, we consider the introduction of carpool rides on a ride-hailing app and evaluate the causal impacts on both riders’ and drivers’ welfare. We use a unique and proprietary dataset with fine-grained trip-level information provided by the leading ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing and exploit a natural experiment of the introduction of carpool rides on this platform. We estimate the economic impacts on both riders and drivers, including earnings, working hours, travel distance, spending and usage intensity, and behavioral changes such as changes in travel patterns due to the introduction of carpooling. Our study provides empirical evidence that DiDi Carpool significantly increases overall spending, orders, and travel distance and reduces unit cost for riders, and drivers’ earnings and working hours also increase. We also show the existence of cannibalization effects between DiDi Carpool and DiDi Express that riders’ spending on and usage of DiDi Express decline after the launch of DiDi Carpool. Meanwhile, Carpooling services improve the platform’s efficiency by reducing the geographic dispersion of drivers’ pick-up locations and encourage riders to explore a wider range of city landscapes.

It is essential for policymakers to understand the economic and societal impacts that these platforms pose, as well as the effects of the regulatory responses that have been implemented thus far. This study aims to address these questions by empirically investigating how Airbnb’s entry generates financial liquidity and mitigates financial delinquencies for households affected. Our findings indicate that Airbnb’s entry generates a positive shock to household liquidity, resulting in a reduction of mortgage loan and auto loan delinquencies by 2.56% and 7.53%, respectively. However, we also discovered that the effects of Airbnb’s entry can be offset by local regulations, particularly those more stringent ones that restrict unapproved guest stays without hosts’ presence. Further, with substantial heterogeneous analyses, we uncover that Airbnb’s entry effects are stronger among communities with higher social capital, more job opportunity, a higher non-white ratio, a lower Gini coefficient, a lower investment property ratio, and a lower homestead exemption. We also discovered that the effects of regulating Airbnb on financial delinquencies were stronger in areas where the majority voted for the Democratic Party. Furthermore, with individual-level evidence, our investigation into the mechanisms of Airbnb’s entry and regulations on debt repayments revealed that Airbnb hosts who generated liquidity through the platform made larger, more frequent, and earlier loan repayments, while regulations resulted in a drop in loan repayments. We also contrasted Airbnb hosts with Uber drivers in loan repayments and found a unique pattern of Airbnb hosts repaying long-term debts with collateral.

This paper empirically investigates how algorithm-driven price volatility influences the occupancy rates of more than 105,000 rental properties in New York City listed on Airbnb. Because properties on Airbnb can be booked up to 12 months in advance, we compile two price-volatility measures: a property’s frequency of price changes across travel dates on a given booking date (ie, volatility over travel dates) and a property’s frequency of price changes across booking dates on a given travel date (ie, volatility over temporal distances). For both measures, the occupancy rates increase from flat pricing to a certain degree of dynamic pricing. However, the occupancy rates start to decrease when prices become too volatile, controlling for the magnitudes of price-level variation. A series of mechanism checks suggest the price volatility across travel dates leads to quality concerns, whereas the price volatility across temporal distances leads to fairness concerns.

Combining insights from exploratory interviews and surveys with ride-hailing drivers (N= 64) and cognitive appraisal theory, we predicted that pay variability is most likely to result in voluntary turnover when (a) workers were more frequently earning lower-than-average paychecks,(b) felt limited control over their earnings, and (c) their household was dependent upon their paycheck. Using matched survey and archival data from a sample of truck drivers (N= 711) from a national transportation company, we subsequently found that pay variability is positively associated with the likelihood of turnover, but this relationship significantly varied with the predicted contextual moderators. Additional quantitative analyses demonstrated that this relationship was observed even among the highest performing drivers and, surprisingly, likely resulted in less annual pay for those who left.

Although studies have identified challenges to these initiatives for women entering occupations, we uncover a performance recognition penalty for incumbent workers originating from the process of occupational diversification. As women incrementally enter a male-dominated occupation, a conflict arises between the changing gender composition at the work-unit level and the masculine “ideal worker” prototype embedded in the occupation. We propose that this conflict will lower the performance expectations of the work unit, decreasing the individual likelihood of performance recognition for each worker in the unit. Using detailed panel data on police officers, we found that an officer’s individual likelihood of being nominated for a performance award consistently declined when their police unit proportionately increased in women officers. Both men and women managers enacted this penalty, with men managers penalizing men subordinates more than women subordinates. This pattern remained for awards recognizing exceptional performance, regardless of gender-typing of the unit or its work tasks, and considering officer tenure and attrition from the unit.

Drawing on role stress theory, we propose that these characteristics alter the degree to which the cognitive resources appropriated by financial precarity interfere with the resource requirements of a person's work role.

In the current research, we explain the challenge of pursuing passion by conceptualizing passion as an attribute with temporal variation. Viewed through a daily lens, we argue that self-regulation plays a critical role in understanding the challenges underlying the daily maintenance of passion. More specifically, we hypothesize that—unless employees adequately regulate their passion on any given day—higher levels of passion will lead them to invest more time and energy into their work, decreasing their psychological detachment from work after the workday, and consequently resulting in higher levels of emotional exhaustion the next day. Higher levels of emotional exhaustion on a given day subsequently prompt a greater need for recovery, shifting employees’ focus away from devoting time and energy into work, thereby eroding their passion on the following day. Two daily-diary studies covering 30 and 10 consecutive working days provided support for our predictions (N total = 798; k total = 15,702). Employees who felt more in charge of their passion on any given day engaged in self-regulation during their workday, increasing their psychological detachment from work and subsequently being less likely to suffer the detrimental consequences of higher daily passion.

The rapid growth in data and advances in computing are transforming risk management and insurance. Modern predictive techniques, including the rise of machine learning, are expanding and changing the ability to classify risk. New technologies also enable new methods of transferring risk, underwriting, and claims handling, changing and sometimes challenging the nature of traditional insurance products and practices. The special issue encouraged research on the relevance and impact of these trends on risk management and insurance activities. The four articles in this special issue touch on a number of these points. Two of the articles, authored by Zhuo Jin and Chamal Gomes and by Hong Li, Qifan Song, and Jianxi Su, re-spectively, develop approaches to detecting fraud and misrepresentation in insurance applications using advanced machine learning techniques. A third article, authored by Guillen et al.(2021), shows how telematics data can be used to extend pay-how-you drive schemes to penalize"" near-miss"" events. The fourth article, authored by Gregor Weiss, Simon Fritzsch, and Philipp Scharner, investigates the relation between digitalization and the market value of insurers. In this introduction, we set the stage and provide a brief overview and outlook of digital transformation and technology in insurance to highlight the contributions of the four studies.

This allows us to further simulate the microinsurers’ financial results. We find that the risk-adjusted subsidy could significantly improve the loss ratio by almost 40%, and the Ordinary Least Squares model is preferred among the four model forms we test. We contribute to the literature by demonstrating that this method is feasible, and further, by illustrating the potential effect of such a subsidy on micro health insurer outcomes.

In particular, reputation creation, enhancement, and protection are critical to an organization’s success, yet highly challenging given the wide ranging and somewhat opaque nature of the concept. These qualities call for a strong ERM approach to reputation that is holistic and integrative, yet existing knowledge of how to do so is limited.
– The paper evaluates and synthesizes existing reputation literature in developing an enterprise-wide reputation risk management framework incorporating necessary steps, processes, and considerations. We address risk strategy, risk assessment, risk governance, and risk culture as key elements of ERM and conclude with suggestions for future research.
– The results suggest several important ideas which are of great relevance when integrating reputation risk management into an ERM framework. Among these are the importance of: identifying and understanding the purpose of key stakeholders, appreciating the multidimensional and layered effect of events on organizational reputation and monitoring the influence of technological advances.

This research examines consumer response to a brand's launching of an upgraded product and identifies the consumer's ownership status of a previous version of the product as a key dimension that can influence their reaction. Contrary to common intuition, the research demonstrates that while the release of an upgraded product is received positively by nonowners of a previous version, this is not always the case for owners. The authors propose that owners respond unfavorably because the new upgrade increases perceived distance between the owners and the brand as the brand progresses forward with the enhanced products. That is, when the new product replaces an existing product the consumers own, consumers perceive that the brand is moving away from them. This negative effect of an upgrade is attenuated if the owners are provided with an extra source of connection to the brand.

In a stylized behavioral model and five experiments, we generate new insight into when and why this combination of tasks can lead to overconfidence (specifically, overestimating the demand). We theorize that cognitive limitations lead to noisy interpretations of signal information, which itself is noisy. Because people are statistically naive, they directly use their noisy interpretation of the signal information as their forecast, thereby underaccounting for the uncertainty that underlies it. This process leads to unbiased forecast errors when considering products in isolation, but leads to positively biased forecasts for the products people choose to launch due to a selection effect. We show that this selection-driven overconfidence can be sufficiently problematic that, under certain conditions, choosing the product randomly can actually yield higher profits than when individuals themselves choose the product to launch. We provide mechanism evidence by manipulating the interpretation noise through information complexity—showing that even when the information is equivalent from a Bayesian perspective, more complicated information leads to more noise, which, in turn, leads to more overconfidence in the chosen products.

How can we structure feedback to help improve their decision making? Methodology/results: We use a behavioral model to theorize how a diagnosis anchoring and insufficient adjustment heuristic may lead to an over-rationing bias, and we hypothesize when this bias is greatest. We then propose that feedback for rejected patients—above and beyond feedback for admitted patients—is critical for mitigating this bias. This is because feedback for only admitted patients may suffer from a type of path dependency that prevents decision makers from receiving the most helpful disconfirming feedback. We provide evidence supporting these hypotheses using preregistered experiments in which medical students, Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, or Prolific workers manage admissions for simulated hospital units.

Essentially, customers get stuck with low-quality opinions and low purchase likelihoods after unusually bad experiences. However, high-quality opinions after unusually good experiences are quickly corrected. The authors show that dynamic pricing can help mitigate this effect.

The debiasing technique has individuals record estimates of demand outcomes (REDO): participants explicitly record a self‐generated estimate of every demand realization, allowing them to record a different value than the number of sales in periods with stockouts.

In reality, however, individuals are subject to cognitive limitations and make systematic errors. We leverage established psychology on sample naivete to model individuals’ forecasting errors and biases in a way that is portable to operations models. The model has one behavioral parameter and embeds perfect rationality as a special case. We use the model to mathematically characterize point and error forecast behavior, reflecting an individual’s beliefs about the mean and variance of a random variable. We then derive 10 behavioral phenomena that are inconsistent with perfect rationality assumptions but supported by existing empirical evidence. Finally, we apply the model to two operations settings, inventory management and queuing, to illustrate the model’s portability and discuss its numerous predictions. For inventory management, we characterize order decisions assuming behavioral demand forecasting. The model predicts that even under automated cost optimization, one should expect a pull-to-center effect. It also predicts that this effect can be mitigated by separating point forecasting from error forecasting. For base stock models, it predicts that safety stocks are too small (large) for short (long) lead times. We also express the steady-state behavior of a queue with balking, assuming rational joining decisions but behavioral wait-time forecasts.

It enables firms to continue operating while finding a solution to an unexpected event that causes a supply disruption or demand surge. While extremely valuable when actually deployed, stockpiles incur large holding costs and usually provide no benefits until such a time. To help to reduce this cost, this study presents a new approach for managing stockpiles. We show that if leveraged intelligently, stockpiles can also help an organization better meet its own regular demand by enabling a type of virtual pooling we call virtual stockpile pooling (VSP). The idea of VSP is to first integrate the stockpile into several locations’ regular inventory buffers and then dynamically reallocate the stockpile among these locations in reaction to the demand realizations to achieve a kind of virtual transshipment. To study how to execute VSP and determine when it can provide the most value, we formulate a stylized multi‐location stochastic inventory model and solve for the optimal stockpile allocation and inventory order policies. We show that VSP can provide significant cost savings: in some cases nearly the full holding cost of the stockpile (i.e., VSP effectively maintains the stockpile for free), in other cases nearly the savings of traditional physical inventory pooling. Last, our results prescribe implementing VSP with many locations for large stockpiles, but only a few locations for small stockpiles.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12573,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12573,2016.0,Goal 9,0.0114089335967077,False,supply chain disruptions

To build supply chain capabilities, organizations face a choice between two fundamentally different sourcing strategies—reactive capacity and safety stock. We develop a framework to guide the joint sourcing strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost under a target service level. A salient feature of our modeling framework is a novel demand model that captures important continuous-time, non-Markovian characteristics of demand surge trajectories. In addition to the total magnitude as typically modeled in the literature, we define several other metrics of surges, including duration, intensity, compactness, peak position, volatility, and frequency. The resulting optimization problem is challenging because it requires evaluating, for any sample path, whether surge demand can be satisfied at every point in time—a refined feature that traditional models do not have. To identify the optimal strategy, we first characterize the optimal production and deployment policy for any given strategy and then transform the original problem into two equivalent but more tractable problems.

What competitive inventory policy behavior arises under these various payment-timing arrangements? Academic/practical relevance: Technology advancements are increasing the variety of payment triggers between supply chain stages. However, traditional multiechelon inventory models, which were originally developed for vertically integrated systems, do not explicitly account for payments flowing up the supply chain nor issues of payment timing between stages. Methodology: We introduce an analytical modeling methodology to incorporate financial inventory costs generated by payment-timing arrangements between stages in multiechelon inventory models. We also combine these methods with established inventory theory to study competitive inventory policies in a two-echelon system. Results: Under a class of payment-timing contracts, we show how to express payment flows at each stage in terms of standard physical inventory metrics and the demand-arrival process. We also show how to calculate the average inventory costs for each stage under given inventory policies and payment-timing contracts. In the two-echelon base-stock model, we first show that the cost of decentralization under standard wholesale price contracts is significantly driven by too much inventory at the supplier; it is not exclusively driven by too little inventory at the retailer as in the selling-to-the-newsvendor literature. We show that wholesale price contracts with a type of popular consignment payment timing still leads to too little inventory at the retailer. However, we prove there exists a wholesale price contract with partial consignment timing that can achieve the centralized inventory levels at both the supplier and the retailer.

To evaluate the relative importance of treatment outcomes to patients with low-risk thyroid cancer (TC).


SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA
Overuse of total thyroidectomy (TT) for low-risk TC is common. Emotions from a cancer diagnosis may lead patients to choose TT resulting in outcomes that do not align with their preferences.


METHODS
Adults with clinically low-risk TC enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional, longitudinal cohort study from 11/2019-6/2021. Participants rated treatment outcomes at the time of their surgical decision and again 9 months later by allocating 100 points amongst 10 outcomes. T-tests and Hotelling's T2 statistic compared outcome valuation within and between subjects based on chosen extent of surgery (TT vs. lobectomy).


RESULTS
Of 177 eligible patients, 125 participated (70.6% response) and 114 completed the 9-month follow-up (91.2% retention). At the time of the treatment decision, patients choosing TT valued the risk of recurrence more than those choosing lobectomy and the need to take thyroid hormone less (P<0.05). At repeat valuation, all patients assigned fewer points to cancer being removed and the impact of treatment on their voice, and more points to energy levels (P<0.05). The importance of the risk of recurrence increased for those who chose lobectomy and decreased for those choosing TT (P<0.05).


CONCLUSION
The relative importance of treatment outcomes changes for patients with low-risk TC once the outcome has been experienced to favor quality of life over emotion-related outcomes. Surgeons can use this information to discuss the potential for asthenia or changes in energy levels associated with total thyroidectomy.",Semantic Scholar,97.10144927536231,10.1097/SLA.0000000000006347,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/58191c47d7e59073c53535df0277c73e568af39c,2024.0,Goal 7,0.06129360912735929,True,energy for healthcare

We document that the majority of employees chose dominated plans, which resulted in excess spending equivalent to 24% of chosen plan premiums. Low-income employees were significantly more likely to choose dominated plans, and most employees did not switch into more financially efficient plans in the subsequent year.

Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax.

We exploit a natural experiment in the U.S. and find that firms facing an increase in required book-tax conformity increase leverage relative to other firms. We also provide evidence of an increase in the cost of equity (but not of debt) capital for firms facing an increase in required book-tax conformity, relative to control firms, and show that these increases in cost of equity capital are positively associated with an increase in leverage.

However, estimating how each alliance member's centrality affects alliance performance is challenging because the end market might value each partner's contribution differently. We solve this empirical question with a two‐sided matching model that accounts for the partners' endogenous selection and estimates the effect of each side's centrality and input quality on performance. We implement the method in the novel context of the Thoroughbred horse industry, in foal‐sharing alliances between buyers and suppliers. We find that buyer centrality has a larger marginal effect on the alliance performance than the supplier centrality because buyers, who on average are less central in our context, are more likely to diffuse valuable information to the end market. Managerial Summary Alliance partners often struggle with identifying what their contributions and their partner's contribution are to the alliance performance. We use a new method to identify each side's contribution to their alliance. Our findings offer a few recommendations to firms forming similar alliances. First, we find that the less central partner in the business network has greater impact on the alliance performance due to their ability to diffuse more valuable information to the market.

We examine the role of prior industry experience in the startups' next stage—its hiring of new employees. We tackle two empirical challenges—the mutual aspect of hiring and the effect of unobserved variables on employees' earnings using a two‐sided matching model. Our results reveal that even firms founded by entrepreneurs without industry experience can attract new employees with such experience if the founders start with a large entrepreneurial team. Further, startups provide new hires with an earnings premium for their industry experience. Our approach illustrates the benefits of matching models over traditional regressions. Managerial summary Growing startups face the question of who to hire and how much to compensate the new hires. Simultaneously, prospective new hires ask which startup to join and how much their salary will be. We explore these questions using a novel method that tackles the mutual selection process. In the context of five technological manufacturing industries, we find that having industry experience within founding teams may not be necessary to attract new hires with high quality if the startup can signal its own quality through other means such as having a larger founding team. Our results indicate that startups prefer employees with industry experience for which startups offer a wage premium. Thus, employees seeking startup employment benefit from gaining industry experience prior to joining a startup.

By considering all possible matches, we find that firms select each other based on the unique quality of their resources and status positively influences the match for the higher status firm while status negatively influences the match for the lower status firm. The paper uses a two-sided matching model with Bayesian estimation to account for endogeneity of the mutual selection in the alliance. Once the partner selection is controlled for, the performance outcome of the alliance is affected by the quality of the resources and the network centrality of both partners, contrary to prior work which suggests the network position of the lower status firm decreases performance. Our results indicate that firms seek overlapping assurance from the equity alliance and the networks of each of the partners to prevent opportunism in their alliance. Importantly, despite the asymmetric effect of each party’s networks on the match, their unique network positions contribute to a positive outcome for the alliance.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/ambpp.2017.16650abstract,2017.0,Goal 12,0.009315946737902953,False,

However, it is difficult to estimate how each alliance member's centrality affects alliance performance because the end market might value each partner's contribution differently. We solve this empirical question with a two-sided matching model that accounts for the partners’ endogenous selection and estimates the effect of each side's centrality and input quality on performance. We implement the method in the novel context of the Thoroughbred horse industry, in foal-sharing alliances between buyers and suppliers. We find that the buyer centrality has a larger marginal effect on the alliance performance than the supplier centrality because buyers, who on average are less central in our context, are more likely to diffuse valuable information to the end market.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2826704,2020.0,Goal 9,0.0111001306124322,False,

Some researchers propose that the transition to entrepreneurship may be explained by established firms undervaluing knowledge created by employees, whereas other scholars maintain that firm strategies may lead to the underutilization of knowledge. We ask the question of which of these drivers is more pronounced as an explanation of employee entrepreneurship and what technological factors matter in this relationship. Analyzing a unique data set, we find that the likelihood of employee entrepreneurship increases with the inventor’s assessment of the value of a patent for an invention developed while at the incumbent firm but dramatically decreases when the invention protected by the patent is commercialized by the firm, licensed to third parties, interdependent with other firms’ inventions protected by patents, or technologically broad. We also find that conditional on high valuation by the inventor, a matching high valuation by the firm further increases the likelihood of transitioning to entrepreneurship. In combination, we show that a situation when both the inventor and the firm consider the invention valuable but the firm ends up not commercializing the invention is more predictive of employee entrepreneurship than simple differences in assessing the value of the invention. The study refines our understanding of the drivers of entrepreneurship by underscoring the “strategic” explanation of employee entrepreneurship.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/orsc.2014.0937,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2014.0937,2015.0,Goal 8,0.01559379901002301,False,entrepreneurship

Manufacturing & Service Operations Management. doi:10.2139/ssrn.2698192",2016,"Cachon, (2016) The Role of Surge Pricing on a Service Platform with Self-Scheduling Capacity","Recent platforms, like Uber and Lyft, offer service to consumers via ""self-scheduling"" providers who decide for themselves how often to work. These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a ""surge pricing"" policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform's profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage or both, and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity.

Standard setters intended KAMs to increase the usefulness of the audit report by requiring the partner‐led engagement team to disclose engagement‐specific information about the most significant judgments they made during the audit. However, stakeholders expressed widespread concern that audit firms' longstanding efforts toward standardization would result in generic KAMs at the audit firm level and provide partners little opportunity or incentive for engagement‐specific reporting. We evaluate this high‐stakes tension between standard setters' goals for audit reporting and auditors' deep‐rooted practices by leveraging data from the United Kingdom, which has required partner identification since 2009 and expanded audit reports since 2013. We find that clients sharing the same partner receive KAMs that are 10% more textually similar than clients with different partners. In contrast, clients sharing the same audit firm receive KAMs that are just 2% more textually similar than clients with different audit firms. This implies that partner decision styles are more important in influencing KAM outcomes than audit firm styles. Collectively, our results suggest that partners make unique KAM reporting judgments, countering concerns that audit firms' efforts toward standardization will yield boilerplate KAMs. This evidence extends the literature on expanded audit reporting and partner decision styles and provides valuable insights into a contemporary issue in audit regulation with broader implications for understanding dynamics within the profession.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1911-3846.12902,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12902,2023.0,Goal 5,0.009832587306903473,False,

Three hundred twenty-six radiomics features were extracted from each thrombus on both NCCT and CTA images. Linear discriminative analysis was applied to select features most strongly associated with early recanalization with IV alteplase. These features were then used to train a linear support vector machine classifier. Thrombus radiomics features derived from NCCT and CTA are more predictive of recanalization with IV alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke with proximal occlusion than previously known thrombus imaging features such as length, volume, and permeability. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombus characteristics identified on non-contrast CT (NCCT) are potentially associated with recanalization with intravenous (IV) alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Our aim was to determine the best radiomics-based features of thrombus on NCCT and CT angiography associated with recanalization with IV alteplase in AIS patients and proximal intracranial thrombi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With a nested case-control design, 67 patients with ICA/M1 MCA segment thrombus treated with IV alteplase were included in this analysis. Three hundred twenty-six radiomics features were extracted from each thrombus on both NCCT and CTA images. Linear discriminative analysis was applied to select features most strongly associated with early recanalization with IV alteplase. These features were then used to train a linear support vector machine classifier. Ten times 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the accuracy of the trained classifier and the stability of the selected features.

Imaging Neuroscience. doi:10.1162/imag_a_00156",2024,"Kirk, (2024) Preliminary evidence for altered brain-heart coherence during anxiogenic movies","Abstract During states of anxiety, fundamental threat circuitry in the brain can increase heart rate via alterations in autonomic balance (increased sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawal) and may serve to promote interoceptive integration and awareness of cardiac signals. Moreover, evidence indicates pathological anxiety could be associated with increased communication between the brain and the heart. Yet, this phenomenon remains not well understood. For instance, studies in this area have been conducted within the confines of tightly controlled experimental paradigms. Whether anxiety impacts brain-heart communication outside of such experimental settings, and in relatively more naturalistic contexts, is less clear. Here, we used a suspenseful movie fMRI paradigm to study induced anxiety (n = 29 healthy volunteers; Caltech Conte dataset; Kliemann et al., 2022). We predicted that brain responses across an anxiety-relevant “defensive response network” (amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate, and anterior insula; Abend et al., 2022) would show increased coherence with heart rate as participants watched a suspenseful movie clip compared to a non-suspenseful movie clip. Counter to our predictions, we found decreased coherence between heart rate and brain responses during increased anxiety, namely in amygdala-prefrontal circuitry. We suggest these alterations may be underpinned by parasympathetic withdrawal and/or decreased interoceptive awareness during suspenseful movie-watching.",Crossref,100.0,10.1162/imag_a_00156,https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00156,2024.0,Goal 12,0.006549050731411758,False,

Nevertheless, in our planned exploratory analyses, we saw a relationship between threat vigilance behavior (but not self‐reported anxiety) and intrinsic amygdala‐periaqueductal gray connectivity.

Using a unique combination of methods and techniques, we explored a dose–response function: Can experienced fear intensity be encoded in fear sweat? Specifically, fear experience was quantified using multivariate pattern classification (combining physiological data and subjective feelings with partial least-squares-discriminant analysis), whereas a photo-ionization detector quantified volatile molecules in sweat. Thirty-six male participants donated sweat while watching scary film clips and control (calming) film clips. Both traditional univariate and novel multivariate analysis (100% classification accuracy; Q 2 : 0.76; R 2 : 0.79) underlined effective fear induction. Using their regression-weighted scores, participants were assigned significantly above chance (83% > 33%) to fear intensity categories (low–medium–high).

We develop a broad set of hypotheses about cross-channel effects based on channel richness and influence roles (informative, persuasive). To test the hypotheses, we model the effects (own and cross) of channel marketing efforts on shopping outcomes in different channels through a simultaneous equation system. We estimate these models using data from the auto insurance industry that comprises the exclusive agent, the independent agent, the Web, and the call center channels. Our results offer novel insights. They show that cross-channel effects and elasticities are significant and asymmetric. While the effect of marketing efforts in a channel on shopping outcomes in a dissimilar (with a different primary influence role) channel is positive (e.g., exclusive agent, the Web, and the call center channels are complementary), the magnitudes of the cross-channel effects are asymmetric.

Analysis of sex-related differences in the diagnostic performance of a market-approved convolutional neural network for skin cancer detection","Background
Advances in biomedical artificial intelligence may introduce or perpetuate sex and gender discriminations. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have proven a dermatologist-level performance in image classification tasks but have not been assessed for sex and gender biases that may affect training data and diagnostic performance. In this study, we investigated sex-related imbalances in training data and diagnostic performance of a market-approved CNN for skin cancer classification (Moleanalyzer Pro®, Fotofinder Systems GmbH, Bad Birnbach, Germany).
Methods
We screened open-access dermoscopic image repositories widely used for CNN training for distribution of sex. Moreover, the sex-related diagnostic performance of the market-approved CNN was tested in 1549 dermoscopic images stratified by sex (female n = 773; male n = 776).
Results
Most open-access repositories showed a marked under-representation of images originating from female (40%) versus male (60%) patients. Despite these imbalances and well-known sex-related differences in skin anatomy or skin-directed behaviour, the tested CNN achieved a comparable sensitivity of 87.0% [80.9%–91.3%] versus 87.1% [81.1%–91.4%], specificity of 98.7% [97.4%–99.3%] versus 96.9% [95.2%–98.0%] and ROC-AUC of 0.984 [0.975–0.993] versus 0.979 [0.969–0.988] in dermoscopic images of female versus male origin, respectively. In the sample at hand, sex-related differences in ROC-AUCs were not statistically significant in the per-image analysis nor in an additional per-individual analysis (p ≥ 0.59).

Design and training of artificial intelligence algorithms for medical applications should generally acknowledge sex and gender dimensions.

To identify disease-driven regulatory circuits of IL-13Rα2, transcriptomic/pathological analysis was performed in skin from patients with AD, psoriasis, healthy subjects, and murine AD model. Functionality was investigated in sensory neurons, keratinocytes and animal model, by using knockdown (KD), calcium imaging, RNA-seq, cytokine arrays, pharmacological assays, and behavioural investigations. In our study, an upregulated IL-13Rα2 expression was revealed in skin of AD patients, but not psoriasis, in a disease activity-dependent manner. In cultured human keratinocytes, IL-13 increased IL-13Rα2 transcription levels, and this were downregulated by IL-13Rα1KD. IL-13Rα2KD reduced transcription levels of EDNRA, CCL20, CCL26.

However, given the inherent variability of oil and natural gas markets, operators pursue production strategies that maximize profitability over resource extraction efficiency. This study focuses on evaluating the implications of contrasting pressure drawdown strategies on the long-term production and resulting economics for a real, producing unconventional gas well in the Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin using a techno-economic analysis approach. Our research combines elements of well-specific horizontal well design, production forecasting, equipment sizing and capital cost estimation, operating cost estimation, and revenue and tax calculations. Gas production forecast outlook scenarios were generated under varying pressure drawdowns using two approaches: 1) a novel physics-informed machine learning workflow and 2) traditional reservoir simulation. A discounted cash flow model was used to evaluate the resulting economic implications for each drawdown scenario—generating output for exploring the coupled effect of factors like the timing and volume of gas production, prevailing economic and market conditions for natural gas, and overall estimated ultimate recovery on profitability metrics such as internal rate of return and net present value. Results show that there is potential to maximize the cumulative gas produced in the specific case study well by employing a lower pressure drawdown. Conversely, the greatest profitability is achieved using rapid drawdown as signified by a small, specific subset of our outlook scenarios. On an averaging basis, we find that the combinations of highest cumulative producing and most profitable scenarios occur under lower drawdowns with long (>40 years) producing timeframes, but require higher relative gas price and lower discounting considerations. The machine learning predictive outlooking capability proved effective for enabling rapid generation of a multitude of scenario forecasts. As a result, a variety of prominent example cases could be generated to strike the balance of greater productivity and economic return given their associated producing features and economic conditions when compared to similar producing scenarios—critical insight that offers improved decision support for unconventional oil and gas operations.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.jgsce.2023.204972,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgsce.2023.204972,2023.0,Goal 8,0.03968576314077467,False,

Intradural extramedullary spinal dissemination of intracranial SFT/HPC is extremely rare. There is a paucity of data available to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of intraspinal dissemination of intracranial SFT/HPC. Herein, we presented a case of intracranial SFT/HPC with intraspinal metastasis. The resected tumor specimens were enrolled in a clinical sequencing program, including whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. By comparing genomic sequencing data of the intracranial tumors with intraspinal metastasis, we established the somatic mutational profiles of these tumors. Clonality analysis revealed a distinct subclonal structure in the intracranial tumor and its intraspinal metastasis, which might reflect the possibility of intratumoral clonal selection and evolution during the process of tumor dissemination. Through bioinformatics analysis and Sanger sequencing validation, a DSTYK mutation (Met296Ile) was identified as a candidate driver of intraspinal metastasis in this SFT/HPC case. Further, an intracranial tumor-derived SFT/HPC cell line, HPC3, was established to explore the mechanisms of the DSTYK mutation in promoting SFT/HPC metastasis. Based on the HPC3 cell model, we found that the DSTYK mutation promoted cell migration and invasion of HPC3 cells via activation of ERK1/2 signaling, which was inhibited by the MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244. The DSTYK mutation was also shown to upregulate the expression of two metastasis-related molecules: MMP2 and MMP9 in HPC3 cells; however, this effect was attenuated by AZD6244 treatment.

Methods Programs Biomed.. doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.03.005",2017,"Zou, (2017) Semi-automatic segmentation of femur based on harmonic barrier","Background and Objective: Segmentation of the femur from the hip joint in computed tomography (CT) is an important preliminary step in hip surgery planning and simulation. However, this is a time-consuming and challenging task due to the weak boundary, the varying topology of the hip joint, and the extremely narrow or blurred space between the femoral head and the acetabulum. To address these problems, this study proposed a semi-automatic segmentation framework based on harmonic fields for accurate segmentation.
Methods: The proposed method comprises three steps. First, with high-level information provided by the user, shape information provided by neighboring slices as well as the statistical information in the mask, a region selection method is proposed to effectively locate joint space for the harmonic field. Second, incorporated with an improved gradient, the harmonic field is used to adaptively extract a curve as the barrier that separates the femoral head from the acetabulum accurately. Third, a divide and conquer segmentation strategy based on the harmonic barrier is used to combine the femoral head part and body part as the final segmentation result.
Results: We have tested 40 hips with considerately narrow or disappeared joint spaces. The experimental results are evaluated based on Jaccard, Dice, directional cut discrepancy (DCD) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and we achieve the higher Jaccard of 84.02%, Dice of 85.96%, area under curve (AUC) of 89.3%, and the lower error with DCD of 0.52mm. The effective ratio of our method is 79.1% even for cases with severe malformation. The results show that our method performs best in terms of effectiveness and accuracy on the whole data set.

Herein, we propose that overclaiming is also contextually dependent on the informational environment. We find a robust assimilation effect of informational familiarity; people claim more knowledge of concepts that do not exist when they appear among familiar (versus unfamiliar) concepts (Studies 1–4). This effect is mediated by a self-inference process, whereby familiarity with real concepts leads people to infer they are knowledgeable on the topic, which in turn leads them to infer they also know nonexistent concepts ostensibly related to the topic (Studies 5–7).

Supporting this hypothesis, we find that the more a person knows about a topic, the less likely they are to “overclaim” knowledge of nonexistent terms in that topic. Moreover, such expertise protects against overclaiming especially when people are most prone to overclaim – when they view themselves subjectively as experts. We find support for these conclusions in an internal meta-analysis (17 studies), in comparisons of experts and novices in medicine and developmental psychology, and in an experiment manipulating expertise. Finally, we find that more knowledgeable people make knowledge judgments more automatically, which is related to less false familiarity and more accurate recognition. In contrast, their less knowledgeable peers are more likely to deliberate about their knowledge judgments, potentially thinking their way into false familiarity.

However, if the manufacturer has exclusive product advertising authority, as compared to the case in which both channel members can advertise product, the manufacturer’s exclusive product advertising authority can lead to a decreased product advertising provision as well as a decreased price advertising provision; and it may even hurt the manufacturer while benefiting the retailer.

Two versions of the model are developed: one in which buyers visit homes randomly and another where search is directed by seller reserve prices. The analysis demonstrates that granular shocks and microstructure frictions—arising from the interaction of idiosyncratic and infrequent transactions, search frictions, and auctions-based pricing—generate persistent volatility, even in large markets such as Los Angeles. The paper also identifies systematic weekly patterns in housing activity, which account for up to 60% of monthly variation in sales and listings due to calendar composition. Recognizing and filtering out these predictable fluctuations ensures that the model targets economically meaningful sources of volatility.

However, it is also typically assumed that employees are reluctant to invest in firm-specific skills because such investments may come at the cost of developing general skills, thereby reducing their attractiveness in the labor market. This creates a theoretical paradox: Employee investment in firm-specific human capital is crucial for value creation and appropriation, yet there is believed to be global underinvestment in firm-specific skills. We argue that the logic behind this theory depends on the assumption that firm-specific human capital is accurately and objectively perceived among labor market participants and that relaxing this assumption significantly limits conclusions that can be drawn about competitive advantage. The key takeaway is that perceptions of firm specificity, even if inaccurate, can be more important than objective firm-specific human capital in determining the likelihood that firm-specific human capital can be a source of sustained advantage. By relaxing the assumption of strong-form labor market efficiency, we develop propositions regarding how firms can facilitate and manage perceptions of firm specificity, thereby increasing the likelihood that a competitive advantage can be sustained.

The resulting reduction in relevant board industry experience and competitor interlocks is likely to affect firm outcomes. In their advisory role, competitor-interlocked directors with more industry experience have historically produced higher profit margins, likely due to superior R&D investment advice.

Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than non-targeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4 to 1.8 percent of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax.

Social Science Research Network. doi:10.2139/ssrn.4566408",2023,"Daniels, (2023) Congestion in the Age of Uber: Medallion Management and Taxi Hailing Technology","Problem Definition: The introduction of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) into ride-hailing markets poses a challenge for congestion-sensitive regulators. Many large cities have historically been served exclusively by street-hailing taxis, which, to operate, require one of a limited number of medallions issued by a regulator. TNCs differ from taxis in two important ways: (i) the regulator does not control their supply of self-scheduling drivers, and (ii) they use a more efficient hailing technology (""e-hailing""). We study how the use of two existing regulatory powers -- issuing medallions and restricting taxi hailing technology -- can address congestion caused by the TNC.
Methods: To minimize congestion, the regulator decides how many medallions to issue and whether to improve taxi hailing by allowing taxis to e-hail. The regulator’s optimization is influenced by the equilibrium behavior of TNC drivers, who choose whether to drive, and passengers, who choose to patronize taxis or the TNC and for whom the regulator must ensure sufficiently fast pickups.
Results: In many cities, the regulator's existing powers are sufficient to mitigate congestion caused by the TNC. This is accomplished by improving taxi hailing and reducing the number of medallions in circulation. However, in other cities, improving taxi hailing leads to more congestion. We find that improving taxi hailing can encourage more TNC drivers to drive, offsetting the gains from making taxis more efficient. Finally, we show that the regulator never prefers a TNC monopoly and often prefers a competitive market.
Managerial Implications: This work provides concrete recommendations to regulators, identifying when to increase or decrease the number of medallions in circulation and/or improve taxi hailing in response to the presence of a TNC. Our results caution that regulators should be wary of the seeming efficiency of improving taxi hailing, which may increase overall congestion.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.4566408,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4566408,2023.0,Goal 11,0.02346925158844557,False,traffic congestion

We provide a novel characterization of the distribution of street hailing wait times, which we compare to the established wait distribution with central dispatch. While central dispatch delivers substantially shorter wait times on average in practical applications, street hailing more frequently offers short wait times. We construct a model where operational frictions from matching are the primary driver of competition between taxis and Uber for two types of wait-sensitive passengers. The first type -- constrained passengers -- requires a ride within a limited time frame and prefers the ride-hailing service more likely to meet this constraint. The second type -- unconstrained passengers -- does not adhere to a rigid schedule and prefers the ride-hailing service with shorter expected wait. We derive the status quo equilibrium where taxis use street hailing and Uber uses central dispatch and ask whether taxis can capture more market share by centralizing their dispatch. Doing so is not definitively beneficial for taxis.

To achieve this, they often rely on donations of physical goods, which can not only further the mission of the NPO, but also give new life to used goods destined for the landfill. However, not all donations are wanted or needed - the NPO may be space constrained or the donation may be of poor quality. Accepting unwanted donations imposes non-trivial operational costs on the NPO or its downstream partners. Nonetheless, NPOs often hesitate to reject unwanted items, fearing negative repercussions for future donations. To better understand these repercussions, we study how donors respond to rejection using a controlled experiment. Subjects repeatedly choose whether to complete a real-effort task that generates a donation, which is rejected with a fixed probability whose value is unknown to them. We measure subjects' donation decisions and beliefs about the probability that their donations are accepted. We compare these measures against a for-profit experimental condition wherein the subject, not an NPO, receives the payment generated by the real-effort task. Our results identify a mechanism by which rejections affect donations: via a reduction in donors' beliefs about future success.

We empirically measure the impact of expanding access to gigs on worker welfare, with a focus on low-income families.

Academic/Practical Relevance: Understanding the welfare implication of access to gigs informs workers considering working gigs and regulators empowered to protect them. Additionally, firms who rely on this working arrangement may find themselves exposed to increased worker turnover and regulatory intervention if gigs negatively impact worker welfare.

Methodology: We analyze a novel data set documenting the financial health of a sample of low-income families. We are interested in the likelihood that a family experiences hardship, meaning they fail to pay their bills on time. We leverage the sequential launch of Uber's UberX service across locations to identify the impact of the associated increase in access to gigs on hardship via a difference-in-differences design. The granularity of our data allows exploration of possible mechanisms for our results.

Results: We find that UberX increases hardship among the low-income population, primarily by decreasing overall take-home pay (i.e. annual income less expenses). This is despite a corresponding reduction in income volatility, generally a boon to low-income families who have insufficient savings to weather unexpected dips in earnings.

Managerial Implications: These results caution that gigs can be harmful to the most vulnerable members of society, bolstering the position of Uber drivers suing for employee status and governments seeking to regulate the gig economy.

Surgery. doi:10.1016/j.surg.2022.05.002",2022,"Chiu, (2022) The relative importance of treatment outcomes to surgeons' recommendations for low-risk thyroid cancer","Background
The treatment of low-risk thyroid cancer is controversial. We evaluated the importance of treatment outcomes to surgeons’ recommendations.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey asked thyroid surgeons for their treatment recommendations for a healthy 45-year-old patient with a solitary, low-risk, 2-cm papillary thyroid cancer. The importance of the 10 treatment outcomes (survival, recurrence, etc.) to their recommendation was evaluated using constant sum scaling, a method where 100 points are allocated among the treatment outcomes; more points indicate higher importance. The distribution of points was compared between surgeons recommending total thyroidectomy and surgeons recommending lobectomy using Hottelling’s T2 test.
Results
Of 165 respondents (74.3% response rate), 35.8% (n = 59) recommended total thyroidectomy and 64.2% (n = 106) lobectomy. The importance of the 10 treatment outcomes was significantly different between groups (P < .05). Surgeons recommending total thyroidectomy were most influenced by the risk of recurrence (19.1 points; standard deviation 16.5) and rated this 1.6-times more important than those recommending lobectomy. Conversely, surgeons recommending lobectomy placed high emphasis on need for hormone replacement (14.3 points; standard deviation 15.4), rating this 3.1-times more important than those recommending total thyroidectomy.
Conclusion
Surgeons who recommend total thyroidectomy and those who recommend lobectomy differently prioritize the importance of cancer recurrence and thyroid hormone replacement. Understanding how surgeons’ beliefs influence their recommendations is important for ensuring patients receive treatment aligned with their values.

Journal of Risk and Uncertainty. doi:10.1007/s11166-020-09327-4",2020,"Jaspersen, (2020) Linking subjective and incentivized risk attitudes: The importance of losses","The “general risk question” (GRQ) has been established as a quick way to meaningfully elicit subjective attitudes toward risk and correlates well with real-world behaviors involving risk. However, little is known about what aspects of attitudes toward financial risk are captured by the GRQ. We examine how answers to the GRQ correlate with different preference motives and biases toward financial risk using an incentivized choice task (n = 1,730). We find that the GRQ has meaningful correlation with loss aversion and attitudes toward variation in financial losses, but much weaker to non-existent correlations with attitudes toward variation in financial gains, likelihood insensitivity, and certainty preferences. These results suggest that practical applications using the GRQ as an index for financial risk preferences may be most appropriate in settings where decisions rest on attitudes toward financial losses.",Crossref,0.0,10.1007/s11166-020-09327-4,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11166-020-09327-4,2020.0,Goal 17,0.02357817038551821,False,

Reference-dependent models predict that the risk attitudes people have toward these types of lotteries will depend on what reference point they use. In this paper, we consider whether a job-application setting in the laboratory can give rise to strong loss aversion and application avoidance. We test for this in a real-effort experiment where we observe application decisions for a job paying a bonus conditional on different levels of an application fee. We also implement a neutral monetary lottery with the same consequential decisions. Our experimental evidence reveals substantial reluctance to take on risk in job applications, but to an extent similar to that found in lottery entry decisions. We do not find support for application avoidance.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.socec.2019.02.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2019.02.009,2019.0,Goal 1,0.01409853837470472,False,

We exploit a field experiment that randomized access to savings accounts among a largely unbanked population of Nepalese villagers. One year after the accounts were introduced, we administered lottery-choice and intertemporal-choice tasks to the treatment and control groups. We find that the treatment is more willing to take risks in the lottery-choice task and is more responsive to changes in experimental interest rates in the intertemporal-choice task. The results on time discounting are less conclusive, but suggest that the treatment group is more willing to delay receiving money. These results suggest that access to formal savings devices has a positive feedback loop for poor families by increasing their willingness to take risks and to delay gratification.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.01.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.01.001,2016.0,Goal 1,0.02455294759748752,False,
