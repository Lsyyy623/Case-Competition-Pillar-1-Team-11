Behavior in Long-Run Projects and Elicited Time PreferencesManagerial and Decision Economics,"Akin, Z. & Yavas, A",2025,,"We investigate behavior in long-run projects and its relationship with experimentally elicited time preferences. Participants engage in a longitudinal project requiring sustained real effort, with their time preferences estimated through monetary outcomes. We observe a tendency to front-load real effort, with choices reflecting both present and future bias, the former being more prevalent and severe. We also find evidence of naive choice reversals. However, there is no support for the quasi-hyperbolic discounting model in monetary choices, and its predictions do not align with real effort allocation patterns. Nevertheless, discount rate and present bias parameters derived from monetary outcomes demonstrate predictive power over real effort allocation.",,0.0,,,Goal 5,0.004648727544077836,False,
"Housing Markets: Auctions, Microstructure Noise, and Weekly PatternsJournal of Banking and Finance","Arefeva, A",2025,,"This paper examines the drivers of housing market volatility through dynamic search-and-matching models that incorporate auctions. Two versions of the model are developed: one in which buyers visit homes randomly and another where search is directed by seller reserve prices. The analysis demonstrates that granular shocks and microstructure frictions—arising from the interaction of idiosyncratic and infrequent transactions, search frictions, and auctions-based pricing—generate persistent volatility, even in large markets such as Los Angeles. The paper also identifies systematic weekly patterns in housing activity, which account for up to 60% of monthly variation in sales and listings due to calendar composition. Recognizing and filtering out these predictable fluctuations ensures that the model targets economically meaningful sources of volatility. Together, granular shocks, microstructure frictions, and weekly patterns explain 70%–80% of sales and listings volatility, with the remainder driven by exogenous shocks. These findings underscore the importance of auctions, granular shocks, microstructure frictions, and weekly patterns in understanding housing market dynamics.",,0.0,,,Goal 1,0.02036941184286666,False,
Auditor Task PrioritizationContemporary Accounting Research,"Dierynck, B. & Peters, C",2025,,"We study how auditors prioritize their tasks and how differential task prioritization affects auditors' judgment performance. We leverage Conservation of Resources theory to build our predictions and test these predictions using three experiments with over 350 professional auditors. The first two experiments focus on investigating whether task prioritization affects auditors' judgment performance. Across two settings, we manipulate task order and find that prioritizing an easy task leads to lower judgment performance than prioritizing a difficult task. In our third experiment, we give auditors discretion over task ordering and find that they tend to prioritize easy tasks over difficult tasks. Easy task prioritization is further exacerbated under higher time pressure and is least prevalent in conditions where time pressure is lower and psychological ownership is enhanced.",,0.0,,,Goal 15,0.01577848008000159,False,

Employer Credit Checks: Poverty Traps versus Matching EfficiencyReview of Economic Studies,"Corbae, D. & Glover, A",2025,,"We develop a framework to understand pre-employment credit screening as a signal from credit markets that alleviates adverse selection in labour markets. In our theory, people differ in both their propensity to default on debt and the profits they create for firms that employ them; in our calibrated economy, highly productive workers have a low default probability. This leads firms to create more jobs for those with good credit, which creates a poverty trap: an unemployed worker with poor credit has a low job finding rate, but cannot improve her credit without a job. This manifests as an endogenous loss in present-discounted wages that is typically taken as exogenous in quantitative models of consumer default. Banning employer credit checks eliminates the poverty trap, but pools job seekers and reduces matching efficiency: average unemployment duration rises by 2 days for high productivity workers and falls by 13 days for low-productivity workers.",Crossref,0.0,10.18651/rwp2023-01,https://doi.org/10.18651/rwp2023-01,Goal 8,0.07564513092195033,True,precarious employment
Risk-Free Rates and Convenience Yields Around the WorldJournal of Finance,"Diamond, W. & Van Tassel, P",2025,,"This paper constructs risk-free interest rates implicit in index option prices for 10 of the major G11 currencies. We compare these rates to the yields of government bonds to provide international estimates of the convenience yield earned by safe assets. Average convenience yields across countries are highly correlated with the average interest rate in each country, ranging from 2 basis points in low-rate Switzerland to 61 basis points in high-rate Australia, with the moderate-rate US providing a middling 34 basis points. For each country, a covered interest parity (CIP) deviation constructed from its option-implied rates and those of the US is negative, with these negative CIP deviations growing sharply in periods of financial distress, including the 2020 covid crisis when convenience yields themselves remained moderate. We conclude that riskfree discount rates in the US are especially low due to its central position in the global financial system, particularly during financial crises, but that US safe assets do not earn an unusually large convenience yield in addition.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.4216822,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4216822,Goal 17,0.03463540576062216,False,

The Effect of Public RPI and Public Goals on PerformanceJournal of Management Accounting Research,"Ahn, S. & Choi, J. & Yatsenko, D",2025,,"Recent studies find public relative performance information (RPI) may reduce performance. A common thread in these studies is the presence of other public information besides public RPI. We contribute to this line of research by demonstrating that the effects of public RPI on performance are weaker when employees set public performance goals than when they do not set any performance goals. We theorize this attenuating effect occurs because public RPI facilitates social comparisons between participants’ goals and their performance, and participants who set public performance goals seek to be known as goal attainers and garner favorable status in the eyes of their peers. Consistent with our theory, we find public RPI leads participants to set easier public performance goals and to be more likely to attain them. Collectively, these results reinforce the need for firms to consider what other information is made public when providing public RPI.",,0.0,,,Goal 11,0.03076763627431079,False,
Firm Leverage and Stock Price Crash Risk: The Chinese Real Estate Market and Three-Red-Lines PolicyJournal of Real Estate Finance and Economics,"Chu, X. & Deng, Y. & Tsang, D",2025,,"This study examines the relationship between firm leverage and stock price crash risk, where extant literature shows mixed findings on the impact of leverage on stock price crashes. Utilizing the Chinese real estate industry setting with high debt financing, we show that leverage is significantly positively associated with stock price crash risk. We further examine how the relationship between leverage and stock price crash risk is attributed to the unique Chinese institutional and economic environment. We show that the effect of leverage on stock price crash risk is concentrated in regions of low social trust, low marketization, and low economic growth. We next consider China’s new guidance of the “three red lines” that governs firms’ debt financing policies, and we find that, among the three-red-line debt measures, the liability-to-asset ratio is the most significant determinant of crash risk. We also examine the implementation of the guidance in August 2020 with a difference-in-difference research design, and we show that the new guidance has significantly reduced stock price crash risk for high-leverage firms. Overall, our results show consistent evidence of stock price crash risk increases for Chinese real estate firms that have shown overreliance on debt financing.

The portfolio setting allows us to provide strong evidence that misreporting happens in the early stages of intermediation by lenders.

The Impact of Co-location on Production Knowledge Transfer in Collectivist and Individualist CulturesInternational Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Kent, P. & Siemsen, E. & Shao, X",2024,,"Firms often shift production within and between countries. Such a change in the location of a process is fraught with challenges, requiring the firm to ramp-up production at the new site. Firms can overcome this hurdle by thoughtfully managing the transfer of production knowledge associated with the move. One approach to do so is co-location – moving people from the source location to the destination to ensure that team members at the destination can benefit from learnings at the source. But the transfer of tacit knowledge inherent in such a co-location approach faces different challenges across various national cultures. We employ a team-based behavioral experiment to examine knowledge transfer effectiveness within and between an individualist society (the United States) and a collectivist one (China). We look at co-location and its impact on knowledge transfer within and between these two unique cultures. We can overcome knowledge transfer challenges for Chinese recipient teams by co-locating source and recipient team members. However, co-location has little impact on the performance of US recipient teams. These results suggest that firms should assess the national cultural context when considering co-location to manage their production move. Co-location may be incredibly useful to facilitate an effective knowledge transfer in some contexts (e.g. collectivist cultures like China). This approach may not be as helpful in other contexts (e.g. individualistic cultures like the United States).",,0.0,,,Goal 12,0.01715456128293122,False,

Such delays may or may not cause delays in the overall project completion time. If an overall project delay results, the project manager incurs a penalty based on the terms of the contract established with the customer.

We argue that as uncertainty increases, the choice of commercialization mode will increasingly be driven by differences in subjective judgments of the idea’s value, with firms having an advantage in assessing the true value of their employee’s ideas relative to market because of their firm-specific nature. Building on this insight, we develop a formal model of commercialization choice that maps idea characteristics to commercialization outcomes—spinouts, internal commercialization, market mobility, or abandonment—while also predicting how these relationships will be moderated by the cost of startups, the value of the idea, and the institutional context, as well as how value will be created and appropriated within each mode. In particular, the model distinguishes between four different types of employee spinouts, including the previously neglected case where the employer sees value in an idea and wants to commercialize it, but the employee still prefers to start their own firm. We thus offer a more nuanced view of employee entrepreneurship, based on differences in subjective judgment under uncertainty, the firm-specific nature of employee knowledge, and appropriability regimes.",,0.0,,,Goal 9,0.01029039237876631,False,
AI-human hybrids for Marketing Research: Leveraging LLMs as CollaboratorJournal of Marketing,"Arora, N. & Chakraborty, I. & Nishimura, Y",2024,,"The authors’ central premise is that a human–LLM (large language model) hybrid approach leads to efficiency and effectiveness gains in the marketing research process. In qualitative research, they show that LLMs can assist in both data generation and analysis; LLMs effectively create sample characteristics, generate synthetic respondents, and conduct and moderate in-depth interviews. The AI–human hybrid generates information-rich, coherent data that surpasses human-only data in depth and insightfulness and matches human performance in data analysis tasks of generating themes and summaries. Evidence from expert judges shows that humans and LLMs possess complementary skills; the human–LLM hybrid outperforms its human-only or LLM-only counterpart. For quantitative research, the LLM correctly picks the answer direction and valence, with the quality of synthetic data significantly improving through few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation.

The belief that actual FSHC constrains mobility undergirds itscritical role in resource-based theory. However, this rests on a strong assumption ofinformation efficiency that market actors correctly assess how specific an individual’sskills are, and price it appropriately. Emerging theoretical viewpoints dispute this,pointing out labor market imperfections and substantial difficulty in observing FSHC.We therefore develop theory about how perceived FSHC may relate positively to mobilityby articulating a role for well-known supply-side mechanisms such as job satisfaction,embeddedness, and preference for job autonomy. Using two archival surveys and twoprimary surveys collected in very different contexts (South Korea and the United States),we found support for our theory. Perceptions of FSHC were associated with increasedmobility and thiseffect was partially mediated byjob satisfaction and job embeddedness.The effect was augmented for workers who value autonomy in their jobs (and who aremore likely to exit if they perceived their skills as FSHC).

We then explore how managers may actively manipulate their counterpart’s perceptions to maximize their firm’s value capture. We theorize about when this may occur and the implications for contractual governance, value creation/capture, and repeated exchanges – each of which may vary from extant predictions. By applying both an expanded bounded rationality assumption (including cognitive distortions) and net value capture motivation symmetrically, we augment contract design research allowing it to predict when and how managers’ strategic behavior may impact exchange outcomes.

Financial Returns to Household Inventory ManagementJournal of Financial Economics,"Baker, S. & Johnson, S. & Kueng, L",2024,,"Households tend to hold substantial amounts of non-financial assets in the form of consumer goods inventories that are unobserved by traditional measures of wealth, about $725 on average for products covered by our sample. Such holdings can eclipse total financial assets among households in the lowest income quintile. Households can obtain significant financial returns from strategically shopping and managing these inventories. In addition, they choose to maintain liquid savings—household working capital—not just for precautionary motives but also to support this inventory management. We demonstrate that households earn high marginal returns from investing in household working capital, well above 20% at low levels of inventory, though these marginal returns decline rapidly as inventory increases. Nevertheless, average returns from inventory management are high—about 50% for the typical household—and affect household portfolio returns substantially for all but the top income and asset quintiles. We provide evidence from scanner and survey data that supports this conclusion. For many households, working capital is therefore an important asset class that has been largely ignored by the household finance literature, and inventory management provides them with an alternative to investing in risky financial markets at low levels of liquid wealth.",Crossref,0.0,10.3386/w27740,https://doi.org/10.3386/w27740,Goal 8,0.01993658294761666,False,
Correlation in State and Local Tax ChangesJournal of Public Economics,"Baker, S. & Janas, P. & Kueng, L",2024,,"Empirical research in public economics, including our own, often uses variation in state and local taxes as an empirical laboratory to estimate causal relationships. A key concern is that other taxes might change at the same time. To assess this concern, we develop a dataset of state (1977–2022) and local (2000–2022) tax rates and revenue from personal income, corporate income, property, sales, and excise taxes. This new dataset generates two key results. First, we find that taxes of different types tend to co-move within a jurisdiction: a tax change of one type can more than double the likelihood of a second tax type changing in the same year.

Actual Private Information Disclosure in Online Social Networking Sites: A Reflective–Impulsive ModelJournal of the Association for Information Systems,"J, Z. & Wang, W. & Khansa, L. & Kim, S",2024,,"People disclose their private information on social networking sites (SNS) despite their concerns about privacy invasion—a phenomenon referred to as the privacy paradox. Extant studies explaining this paradox have primarily used privacy calculus theory, which assumes that individuals rely on reflective factors to make decisions. This theory can easily predict the intention of private information disclosure (PID) but lacks the power to explain actual PID. This study follows the reflective-impulsive model, which encompasses reflective and impulsive systems to explain actual PID. We collected data from multiple sources to test our hypotheses. We surveyed users of a leading SNS in China, retrieved the messages and photos disclosed by the survey respondents, and invited their SNS “friends” to evaluate this retrieved content to measure the respondents’ PID. Results support the research model as follows: First, in the impulsive system, immediate rewards lead to impulsiveness (compared to long-term social rewards that inhibit impulsiveness), which, in turn, influences PID. Second, in the reflective system, task-focused coping responses mediate the effects of privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy on PID. Third, the effect of task-focused coping responses under the reflective system contrasts with impulsiveness—since the latter is not contingent on users’ privacy invasion experience. This study contributes to the information privacy literature by applying reflective-impulsive model to explain the actual PID of SNS users and by delineating the different contingent roles of users’ privacy invasion experience for both systems’ effects.",Crossref,0.0,10.17705/1jais.00889,https://doi.org/10.17705/1jais.00889,Goal 16,0.01872289856461449,False,privacy rights

Consumer Preferences and Firm Technology ChoiceInternational Journal of Research in Marketing,"Liu, Y. & Yildirim, P. & Zhang, Z",2024,,"Advances in technology change the way consumers search and shop for products. Emerging is the trend of home-shopping devices such as Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home, which allow consumers to search or order products. We investigate how consumer brand and technology preferences may interact with the functionalities of technology-enabled shopping (TES) devices to determine the channel structure and market competition.
In specific, we break the functionalities of the TES devices into two: (1) the shopping support functionality (SSF), and (2) the ordering convenience functionality (OCF). Via a series of experiments, we document that stronger brand preferences are negatively correlated with the willingness to use a TES device that offers SSF. However, there is no association with brand preferences and desire to use a TES device when it offers OCF.
We build an analytical model integrating the findings from these experiments, and then derive the equilibrium channel and pricing strategies for two competing retailers. Our findings show that the functionality of TES devices results in vastly different distribution and pricing strategies in retail markets. In particular, consumers’ heterogeneous valuation of the SSF results in a monopolistic adoption of TES devices by the retailers in equilibrium, and generates Pareto improvements for both. In contrast, when the TES devices offer OCF, in equilibrium, retailers adopt TES channels competitively, resulting in a prisoners' dilemma outcome. In the extensions, studying a third-party technology developer's decision to invest in OCF and SSF technologies, we show that the contrast between the channel strategies under the OCF and the SSF also impact the incentives to develop TES. We show that in some cases, in an effort to mitigate downstream retail competition, the provider may prefer not to offer the best possible OCF technology to consumers.

A Carnegie Perspective on Intermittent Risk Taking in EntrepreneurshipFrontiers in Psychology (Special Issue on Decision Making and Problem Solving in Organizations: Assessing and Expanding the Carnegie Perspective),"Kim, J. & Terlaak, A. & Yu, N",2023,,"Varying risk-taking tendency is an important area of inquiry for the Carnegie perspective. Drawing on organizational learning literature, we develop a model to illuminate the mechanisms that can underlie time-varying risk taking tendency in entrepreneurship. In particular, we delineate conditions under which abrupt risk taking punctuates periods of risk-avoiding behaviors, a pattern that we call “intermittent risk taking.” We use serial entrepreneurs whose bouts with risk taking are often depicted as driven by an entrepreneurial itch to illustrate our model. In our conceptualization, decision makers engage in an interplay of experiential and vicarious learning as they move into and out of higher-risk self-employment (i.e., venture creation) with in-between stints in lower-risk wage-employment. Using a computational model to simulate the dynamics of this conceptualization, we find that vicarious learning from satisfied risk-avoiding peers can exert a pull that draws disappointed entrepreneurs into periods of risk avoidance (i.e., wage-employment). However, the moment that the satisfaction of these peers fails to convince, this pull wanes. In effect, the entrepreneur vicariously learns that the grass may not be greener on the other side which then leads them to return into self-employment. The itch for risk taking then recurs not necessarily because risky venture creation offers higher payoffs than risk-avoiding options but because decision makers come to see that risk avoidance may not be a satisfactory alternative either — a conceptualization that adds nuance to prior notions of varying risk tendencies and serial entrepreneurship.",Crossref,0.0,10.3389/978-2-8325-5402-9,https://doi.org/10.3389/978-2-8325-5402-9,Goal 8,0.05039718246458559,True,employment; employment opportunities; employment policies; entrepreneurship; labour market; productive employment; unemployment; women's employment

In particular, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in social capital leads to a 0.13 standard deviation decrease in mortgage delinquency. The effect of social capital remains significant after controlling for location fixed effects and addressing endogeneity.

Specifically, this work demonstrates that even if parents do not take the racial demographics of schools into account, preference differences between Black and White parents for other school attributes can still result in segregation. These preference differences stem from motivational differences in pursuit of social status. Given that the de facto US racial hierarchy assigns Black people to a lower social status, Black parents are more motivated to seek schools that signal that they can improve their children's status. Simulations of parental school decisions at scale show that preference differences under an unmitigated school-choice policy lead to more segregated schools, impacting more than half a million US children for every 3-percentage-point increase in school-choice availability. In contrast, if Black and White parents have similar preferences, unmitigated school choice would reduce racial segregation.

Marketing Performance Assessment and Accountability: Process and OutcomesInternational Journal of Research in Marketing,"Morgan, N. & Jayachandran, S. & Hulland, J. & Kumar, B. & Katsikeas, C. & Somosi, A",2022,,"Marketing accountability, and how it may be achieved via performance assessment and metrics, have been central topics in both the marketing literature and practice (Katsikeas et al. 2016). Recent developments in digital channels, the accompanying explosion of data and emergence of marketing automation, the globalization of markets, and the rise of customer experience as a key firm priority have further magnified interest in and the importance of understanding how potential marketing outcomes are and can be achieved (CMO Survey, 2021; Mintz et al., 2021). As a result, gaining clarity on how to design and manage performance assessment systems to deal with these issues has never been more important. This paper argues that further progress in this research domain requires a deep understanding of the marketing performance assessment (MPA) process to provide both a catalyst and foundation for the next generation of research. Although there has been considerable research in the areas of marketing metrics and marketing accountability, much less attention has been paid to the MPA process that links them. Yet, the MPA process is essential to successful marketing management. To address this, we first review past research in this broad domain to answer the “Where have we been?” question that identifies theneed for a new conceptual model. Second, drawing on research findings both within the broad MPA domain and allied areas within and outside of marketing, we develop and detail a new conceptual model of the MPA process and use it to identify what really needs to be known but is currently unclear in this domain (i.e., “Where do we need to go?”). Third, we suggest how these areas of needed inquiry may best be investigated (i.e., “How do we get there?”) by identifying new perspectives, theories, data sources, and analysis approaches that may be productively employed in future research.",,0.0,,,Goal 9,0.01313557293410188,False,research and development; scientific research

Although numerous prior studies have examined individual adoption, use, and continued use of digital games, few attempts have been made to understand how people desire and strive to achieve goals. The objective of this study is to develop and test a model of individual achievement of goals in digital gaming. Drawing upon theories of goal-directed behavior, we propose a conceptual model describing goal setting, goal striving, goal attainment, and feedback evaluations in the context of mobile gaming. To empirically test the proposed model, we collected two sets of (cross-sectional and longitudinal) data from 407 users of Pokemon GO. The results generally indicate that goal-directed effort plays an important role in translating goal desire into goal attainment. In addition, we found prior game points and goal desire have interaction effects on goal-directed effort and the subsequent acquisition of game points. Finally, this study shows that action strategies such as in-game payment and deliberate planning have differential effects on goal-directed effort and satisfying experiences.

Supplier Encroachment with a Dual-Purpose RetailerProduction and Operations Management,"Wang, N. & Li, Z",2021,,"The development of e-commerce has greatly facilitated the practice that suppliers encroach upon the retail realm of downstream retailers through direct channels (e.g., online stores). The literature in this area has investigated profit-maximizing firms, but the role of other organizational structures is not well understood. This study studies supplier encroachment in which the retailer is a dual-purpose corporation that pursues his own profit as well as consumer surplus. We find that the retailer's pursuit of consumer surplus can not only intensify market competition and thus reducing the margin of direct selling, but also motivate the encroaching supplier to set a higher wholesale price compared with the case of no encroachment. The presence of a dual-purpose retailer reduces the effectiveness of using the wholesale price as a lever by the supplier. Therefore, encroaching upon a dual-purpose retailer can hurt the supplier. We examine whether a retailer can benefit from being a dual-purpose corporation and how the retailer's dual objectives affect consumer surplus. Interestingly, a dual-purpose retailer can earn a higher profit than a for-profit retailer as the dual-purpose structure helps deter encroachment (i.e., doing well by doing good). Also, consumer surplus in the case of a dual-purpose retailer can be lower than that with a for-profit retailer. This is because the commitment to be a dual-purpose retailer reduces supplier encroachment and thus reduces the total quantity sold to consumers.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.3504349,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3504349,Goal 17,0.007472539426494344,False,

When the Weak are Mighty: A Two-Sided Matching Approach to Alliance PerformanceStrategic Management Journal,"Fudge Kamal, D. & Honore, F. & Nistor, C",2021,,"Research Summary
Network centrality is an important determinant of alliance performance. However, estimating how each alliance member's centrality affects alliance performance is challenging because the end market might value each partner's contribution differently. We solve this empirical question with a two-sided matching model that accounts for the partners' endogenous selection and estimates the effect of each side's centrality and input quality on performance. We implement the method in the novel context of the Thoroughbred horse industry, in foal-sharing alliances between buyers and suppliers. We find that buyer centrality has a larger marginal effect on the alliance performance than the supplier centrality because buyers, who on average are less central in our context, are more likely to diffuse valuable information to the end market.

Managerial Summary
Alliance partners often struggle with identifying what their contributions and their partner's contribution are to the alliance performance. We use a new method to identify each side's contribution to their alliance. Our findings offer a few recommendations to firms forming similar alliances. First, we find that the less central partner in the business network has greater impact on the alliance performance due to their ability to diffuse more valuable information to the market. Second, our results suggest that product input quality that is relatively unknown impacts alliance performance more than low and average quality. Alliance partners may benefit more from experimenting with unknown inputs. Third, more central actors may reduce spending on mass communications if valuable information comes to the market through their less central partners.",,0.0,,,Goal 9,0.01006458603865471,False,

The Lived Reality of Public Accounting InternsThe Journal of Accounting Education,"Covaleski, M. & Earley, C. & Zehms, K",2021,,"This study examines the lived reality of public accounting interns, including perceived benefits, costs, and competing frictions that are collectively relevant to the norms and social structures in this labor market.

Labor market frictions include variation in perceptions of success versus failure for interns, coupled with sustainability implications for the hiring model of firms.

Charting a Path between Firm-Specific Incentives and Human Capital-Based Competitive AdvantageStrategic Management Journal,"Kryscynski, D. & Coff, R. & Campbell, B",2021,,"Research Summary
Scholars have long recognized the theoretical and practical implications of firm-specific human capital. However, we highlight that firm-specific incentives (i.e., worker incentives that provide more utility to workers in the focal firm than similar incentives available at other employers) provide an important pathway to competitive advantages that has not been comprehensively examined in the extant organizational research. We address this gap by (a) defining firm-specific incentives and showing why they are different from incentive conceptualizations and typologies in the extant literature, (b) articulating potential origins of firm-specific incentives, and (c) formally proposing the conditions under which firm-specific incentives facilitate human capital-based competitive advantages. In so doing, we develop a cohesive theoretical framework of incentive-based competitive advantage that integrates across multiple literatures.

Managerial Summary
Just as companies differentiate their products by creating unique value for customers, they also create unique value for their employees. Some companies do this by offering employee incentives, perks, and benefits that are highly unique to the company and difficult for other companies to imitate. These unique incentives, perks, and benefits can help these companies to attract, motivate, and retain top talent at a financial discount and, accordingly, can help these companies realize competitive advantages over their rivals.

Reinforcement Learning and Mortgage Partial Prepayment BehaviorPacific-Basin Finance Journal,"Deng, Y. & Gu, Q. & He, J",2021,,"An agent can learn from previous experience to make decisions. Several important studies claim that reinforcement learning plays a key role in explaining the evolution of the individual learning process. This paper studies the likelihood of mortgage partial prepayments and the process through which mortgage borrowers learn from making partial prepayment decisions in the residential mortgage market in China. Learning dynamics are measured by studying the mortgage partial prepayment behavior of individual borrowers. A longitudinal discrete choice model of the choice of the mortgage payment is presented and estimated using a rich set of mortgage loan history data from a leading mortgage lender in China. The results indicate that path dependency and reinforcement learning arise whenever a borrower's “partial prepayment” decision depends not only on current-stage variables and his/her individual characteristics but also on the learning experience (both from himself/herself and others). Borrowers with more partial prepayment experience in previous stages have a higher probability of making the same decision in the future. Moreover, learning dynamics are not monotonic, and recent experience plays a larger role than distal experience in determining a partial prepayment decision.",,0.0,,,Goal 4,0.0222550038358094,False,

Yet, evidence on such behaviors is limited. In this paper, we use variation in the propensity to conduct improper transfers induced by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 to quantify the extent of strategic transfers. The Act discouraged asset offloading by introducing significant penalties for such actions. We estimate difference-in-differences models based on the hypothesis that individuals with high levels of self-reported nursing home risk (high risk) will alter transfers based on the Act’s changes, while other individuals remain unaffected. We find that over a two-year horizon, high risk individuals reduced transfers to children on the extensive margin by 10 percent and that the average total amount of transfers decreased by $1,700. We also conduct a triple-differences analysis to examine various forms of heterogeneity. We find that the reduction in transfers we document comes from high risk individuals who are less financially literate, suggesting that more financially sophisticated households either have other mechanisms to shield assets or are not sensitive to Medicaid eligibility.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.3165733,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3165733,Goal 13,0.01248804548672809,False,

Consumer Culture Theory: An Anthropological Contribution to Consumption StudiesThe Routledge Companion to Anthropology and Business,"Thompson, C",2020,,"Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) addresses the rich mosaic of consumer culture and the ways it affects four behavioral clusters of theoretical and practical interest: personal identity; social roles; collectivities and affiliations; and belief systems and values in the framework of global market capitalism.

The domain of consumption spans the acquisition, use, and disposition processes of things, experiences, services, images, and ideas. Not neglected is an examination of the various ideological currents through which consumers legitimate or alternatively contest consumer culture.

The basic CCT framework is a heuristic mapping of four clusters of theoretical and practical interests.

We find that staff auditors consistently underestimate the importance of raising issues compared to their supervisors, and they rely on social cues that are not diagnostic of issue importance in giving voice advice to peers. Finally, we predict and find that staff auditors tend to follow peer advice when it confirms their initial stance, and that an expectation of high (versus low) quality supervisor feedback increases their willingness to speak up. Most importantly, we find that contradictory peer advice only influences staff auditors’ willingness to speak up when leadership feedback is not expected to be of high quality. Together these results indicate that staff auditors seek out and follow voice advice from their peers, but appropriate leadership feedback practices can mitigate the negative impact of peer advice on upward communication.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.3342787,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3342787,Goal 5,0.01125295898109955,False,
Mean Service Metrics: Biased Quality Judgment and the Customer-Server Quality GapManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Batt, R. & Tong, J",2020,,"Problem definition: People often make service-quality judgments based on information about the quality of each server even though they care primarily about the quality each customer experiences. When and how do server-level quality metrics differ from customer-experienced ones? Can people properly account for these differences, or do they drive human judgment and decision biases? Academic/practical relevance: Biased judgments about service quality can cause governments to fund programs suboptimally, organizations to promote the wrong employees, and customers to make disappointing purchases. We further our understanding of the role that cognitive biases play in services and how to manage quality information in light of them. Methodology: We use a mathematical model to define the gap between server-level and customer-experienced quality metrics. We use secondary data in the context of the higher-education industry to quantify the customer–server quality gap in practice. We construct a behavioral model to derive hypotheses about how environmental factors impact the direction and magnitude of judgment biases. Controlled laboratory experiments test the hypothesized biases and mitigation techniques. Results: Our empirical study reveals that the two measures differ enough to drive significant differences in the rank order of school majors, teachers, and airports. Our experiments support our main conjecture that judgments and decisions about customer-experienced metrics are biased toward server-level metrics. Consequently, (1) judgments about customer-experienced quality are biased high/low when quality and server load are negatively/positively correlated, (2) judgments about a server’s absolute impact on customer experience are biased high/low when a server has a smaller/larger load than average, and (3) providing customer-experienced quality metrics mitigate these biases. Managerial implications: Our results help identify when and why service-quality metrics are likely to mislead judgments and bias decisions as well as who is likely to benefit from such biases. The results also guide system designers on how to report metrics when seeking to help support effective decision making.

We test this conceptualization using panel data on all US National Basketball Association players from 2000 to 2009.

Churn also affects how quickly firms respond to shocks in the value of their growth options (i.e. Tobin's~Q). Moreover, high churn firms tended to face steeper declines in consumer spending during the recent COVID-19 outbreak.

This paper aims to evaluate policymakers’ concerns about the lack of competition in highly concentrated markets for public company audits by examining the association between audit fees and the inequality of Big 4 market shares at both the USA national-industry and city-industry levels.

Findings
The findings support a U-shaped association between national-industry inequality and audit fees. As inequality initially increases, fees decrease; however, as inequality becomes increasingly large fees increase. The city-industry level analysis shows the opposite pattern. The results are consistent with capacity constraints at the national-industry level that are less binding at the city-industry level.",,0.0,,,Goal 10,0.1183837565122354,True,economic inequality

In response, many proponents of culturalist paradigms have adopted the vernacular of ‘thick data’ to defend their vulnerable position in the marketing research field.

In building this argument, I first discuss the relevant historical continuities and discontinuities that have shaped the big data myth and the thick data opportunism. Next, I argue that culturally oriented marketing researchers should promote a different ontological frame— the analytics of marketplace assemblages—to address how big data, or more accurately its socio-technical infrastructure, produces new kinds of emergent and hybrid market structures, modes of social aggregation, consumption practices, and prosumptive capacities.",,0.0,,,Goal 9,0.02563418019977053,False,
Intertemporal Substitution in Health Care Demand: Evidence from the RAND Health Insurance ExperimentJournal of Public Economics,"Lin, H. & Sacks, D",2019,,"Nonlinear cost-sharing in health insurance encourages intertemporal substitution because patients can reduce their out-of-pocket costs by concentrating spending in years when they hit the deductible. We develop a test for intertemporal substitution and apply it to data from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, where people were randomly assigned either to a free care plan or to a cost-sharing plan which had coinsurance up to a maximum dollar expenditure (MDE). Hitting the MDE—leading to an effective price of zero—has a bigger effect on health care demand than does being in free care, because people who hit the MDE face low current prices but high future prices, and so stock up on health care. As a result, short-lasting price changes induce nearly twice as big a response as do long-lasting changes. These findings help reconcile disparate estimates of the price elasticity of demand for health care in the existing literature. Failing to account for intertemporal substitution can lead researchers to overstate cost savings from high deductible health plans by 20% or more.",Crossref,0.0,10.3386/w22802,https://doi.org/10.3386/w22802,Goal 3,0.1298287858866846,True,health care costs
Dynamic Capital Allocation with Irreversible InvestmentsInsurance: Mathematics and Economics,"Bauer, D. & Kamiya, S. & Ping, X. & Zanjani, G",2019,,"Capital allocation models generally assume that the risk portfolio is constructed at a single point in time, when the underwriter has full information about available underwriting opportunities. However, in practice, opportunities are not all known at the beginning but instead arrive over time. Moreover, a commitment to an opportunity is not easy to change as time passes. Thus, to optimize a portfolio, the underwriter must make decisions on opportunities as they arrive while making use of assumptions about what will arrive in the future. This paper studies capital allocation rules in this setting, finding important differences from the static setting. The pricing of an opportunity is based on an expected future marginal cost of risk associated with that opportunity—one that will be fully understood only after the risk portfolio is finalized. The risk charge for today’s opportunity is thus a probability-weighted average of the product of the marginal value of capital in future states of the world and the amount of capital consumed by the opportunity in those future states. Our numerical examples illustrate how the marginal cost of risk for an opportunity is shaped by when it arrives in time, as well as what has arrived before it.",,0.0,,,Goal 10,0.0367382092326408,False,

Managing Patient Panels with Non-Physician ProvidersProduction and Operations Management,"Bavafa, H. & Savin, S. & Terwiesch, C",2019,,"In recent years, the drive to contain health care costs has increased scrutiny of the traditional mode of delivering primary care where a patient is treated only by his primary care physician.

In contrast to most currently used models, we treat patient demand for office visits as endogenous and managed by a physician via selection of a revisit frequency consistent with patient preferences. We model these preferences for the frequency of office visits using patients’ perception of their health status as well as the disutility associated with falling sick.

This additional product advertising authority can lead to the manufacturer’s higher but the retailer’s lower profit with increased overall channel profits. However, if the manufacturer has exclusive product advertising authority, as compared to the case in which both channel members can advertise product, the manufacturer’s exclusive product advertising authority can lead to a decreased product advertising provision as well as a decreased price advertising provision; and it may even hurt the manufacturer while benefiting the retailer.

The Price Ain’t Right?

Health spending per privately insured beneficiary differs by a factor of three across geographic areas and has a very low correlation with Medicare spending. For the privately insured, half of the spending variation is driven by price variation across regions and half is driven by quantity variation. Prices vary substantially across regions, across hospitals within regions, and even within hospitals. For example, even for a near homogenous service such as lower-limb MRIs, about a fifth of the total case-level price variation occurs within a hospital in the cross-section. Hospital market structure is strongly associated with price levels and contract structure. Prices at monopoly hospitals are 12 percent higher than those in markets with four or more rivals. Monopoly hospitals also have contracts that load more risk on insurers (e.g. they have more cases with prices set as a share of their charges). In concentrated insurer markets the opposite occurs – hospitals have lower prices and bear more financial risk.

The Elitist Doppelgänger Brand Image and Re-Affirmative Brand Myths: How Consumer–Brand Relationships are Constituted as an Art of LivingJournal of Marketing,"Thompson, C. & Kumar, A",2018,,"Emotional branding is widely heralded as a key to marketing success. However, little attention has been given to the risks posed by this strategy. This article argues that emotional-branding strategies are conducive to the emergence of a doppelgänger brand image, which is defined as a family of disparaging images and meanings about a brand that circulate throughout popular culture. This article's thesis is that a doppelgänger brand image can under-mine the perceived authenticity of an emotional-branding story and, thus, the identity value that the brand provides to consumers. The authors discuss how the tenets of emotional branding paradoxically encourage the formation and propagation of doppelgänger brand imagery. This article develops the counterintuitive proposition that rather than merely being a threat to be managed, a doppelgänger brand image can actually benefit a brand by providing early warning signs that an emotional-branding story is beginning to lose its cultural resonance.

Incentives and Pay for Performance in the WorkplaceAdvances in Motivation Science,"Gerhart, B",2017,,"I provide an overview of key developments in the literature on incentive pay and, more broadly, pay for performance (PFP) in workplace settings. These include the shift from a focus on pay level to an increased interest in PFP in economics and management, versus a decreasing interest in PFP and/or increased skepticism about the effectiveness of PFP in psychology. One part of the explanation for differing views on PFP may be that PFP, as actually used in workplace settings, differs from the type of PFP still mostly studied (individual incentive plans that use a formula to determine incentive payouts based on individual physical output) in psychology and, to a lesser extent, in economics. In work organizations, subjective assessments (ratings) and (often multiple) organization level measures of performance (e.g., revenues, profits) are commonly used as the basis for PFP payouts. We describe research on the use and effectiveness of both types of PFP plans with a particular emphasis on merit pay plans, which rely on subjective assessments of performance, given their wide use. We suggest that the types of PFP programs that are more common in US workplaces are less likely to suffer from the drawbacks of incentive pay (defined as individual incentive plans) often identified.

We exploit a natural experiment in the U.S. and find that firms facing an increase in required book-tax conformity increase leverage relative to other firms. We also provide evidence of an increase in the cost of equity (but not of debt) capital for firms facing an increase in required book-tax conformity, relative to control firms, and show that these increases in cost of equity capital are positively associated with an increase in leverage.

Observing that pregnancy-related care accounts for 40 percent of all claims and 36 percent of the total claims amount, we focus much of our attention on understanding the role of pregnancy in micro health insurance.

Second, managers’ understanding of the drivers of their customers’ satisfaction and loyalty are disconnected from those of their actual customers.

Perceived Firm-Specific Human Capital and TurnoverAcademy of Management Proceedings,"Akinsanmi, O. & Coff, R",2017,,"Drawing on human capital theory, strategy scholars have emphasized firm- specific human capital as a source of sustained competitive advantage. In addition to its role in value creation, FSHC is thought to limit rival imitation and rent appropriation by hindering employee mobility. However, recent research links employee perceptions of FSHC to lower organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Such workers may seem to be an unlikely source of competitive advantage. In this study, we explore micro-foundations of firm-specific human capital by theoretically and empirically examining how employee perceptions of firm-specific skills relate to subsequent turnover - extant literature suggests that turnover would be significantly reduced. We test our hypotheses using a large panel dataset tracking employment, attitudes and outcomes. We find that perceptions of firm specific skills increase the likelihood of subsequent turnover but do not appear to have any effect on wages when people move. That is, just because employees perceive their skills to be specific, does not necessarily mean that their actual external opportunities are constrained. These findings suggest that firm- specific human capital, as perceived by employees, may drive behavior in ways not anticipated by existing theory. This, in turn, may challenge the assumed relationship between firm-specific human capital and sustained competitive advantage.",Crossref,0.0,10.5465/amp.2014.0112,https://doi.org/10.5465/amp.2014.0112,Goal 8,0.02481165954907172,False,
What Leads to Prosocial Behaviors on Social Networking Services: A Tripartite ModelJournal of Management Information Systems,"Kuem, J. & Ray, S. & Siponen, M. & Kim, S",2017,,"The major challenge for social networking services (SNS) has been in getting users to exhibit prosocial behavior by active participation in creating and sharing content. We seek to integrate and reconcile the varying, and sometimes conflicting, explanations of prosocial behaviors at SNS. Rooted in postadoption behavior and commitment theory, our study offers three distinct mechanisms that regulate how one’s experience at an SNS translates into commitment that leads to prosocial behavior. In particular, satisfaction, affective commitment, and active participation substantiate a dedication-based mechanism; past investments, continuance commitment, and resulting inattention to alternatives form a constraint-based mechanism; and social support, normative commitment and users’ intentions to moderate comments are a third, obligation-based mechanism. We empirically tested this tripartite model against data collected from actual Facebook users. The results of our analysis supported the proposed relationships between each mechanism’s experiential factor, mediating type of commitment, and prosocial outcome. Intermechanism effects were rare between commitment mediators and outcomes, they were common between experiential antecedents and commitment factors.

This paper brings new data and analysis to the study of supply and demand conditions in nearly three dozen major cities. We first document the most accurate measures of land values, construction costs, and overall house prices. We then create and investigate a number of supply and demand metrics to see if price growth reasonably can be interpreted as reflecting local market fundamentals. Key results include the following:
(1)
Real house price growth has been high, averaging 10% per annum since 2006. However, there is substantial heterogeneity across markets, ranging from 2.8% (Jinan) to 19.8% (Beijing). House price growth is driven by rising land values, not by construction costs. Real land values have risen by 14.4% per annum on average. In Beijing, the increase has been by a remarkable 27.5% per year (or by 1036%) since 2004.
(2)
There is variation about the strong positive trend in house price and land value growth. Land values fell by nearly one-third at the beginning of the global financial crisis, but more than fully recovered amidst the 2009–2010 Chinese stimulus. More recent growth has been much more modest, with some markets beginning to decline. Quantities of land sales by local governments to private residential developers have dropped sharply since 2013. The most recent data show transactions volumes down by half or more. This should lead to a reduced supply of new housing units in coming years.
(3)
Market-level analysis of short- and longer-run changes in supply–demand balances finds important variation across markets. In the major East region markets of Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen which have experienced very high rates of real price growth, we estimate that the growth in households demanding housing units has outpaced new construction since the turn of the century. However, there are thirteen large markets, primarily in the interior of the country, in which new housing production has outpaced household growth by at least 30% and another eleven in which it did so by at least 10%. Regression results show that a one standard deviation increase in local market housing inventory is associated with a 0.45 standard deviation lower rate of real house price growth the following year.
(4)
There are no official data on residential vacancy rates in China, but some researchers have reported very high figures (17%+). We develop a new series at the provincial level which yields a much lower vacancy rate on average, but it has been rising—from 5.2% in 2009 to 7.8% in 2014.
(5)
The risk of housing even in markets such as Beijing which show no evidence of oversupply, is best evidenced by price-to-rent ratios. They are well above 50 in the capital city. Poterba's (1984) user cost model suggests these levels can be justified only if owners have sufficiently high expectations of future capital gains. Even a modest one percentage point drop in expected appreciation (or increase in interest rates) would result in a drop in prices of about one-third, absent an offsetting increase in rents.",,0.0,,,Goal 8,0.04178757080189989,False,

We find significant differences with external REITs being significantly more transparent relative to internal REITs, and these differences are reflected in the loan contract terms and loan syndicate structure of loans made to these two types of REITs. We find that the relatively more transparent externally advised REITs are offered more favourable loan contracts in terms of lower loan rates and lower likelihood of collateral requirement. Further, loans to external REITs have syndicates that are larger in size and the lead lender retains a smaller portion of the loan, reflecting lower information asymmetry.",Crossref,0.0,10.1007/s11146-016-9550-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11146-016-9550-7,Goal 16,0.007746792059496063,False,

Non-mortgage consumer credit growth also has a negative and robust effect on private saving rate, though its effect is smaller than that of mortgage credit. Business credit growth, on the other hand, has a positive impact on private saving rate. Our results provide strong support for the argument that the high growth rate of consumer credit is a primary reason for the recent decrease in private saving rate in Turkey. We also find that private saving rate displays strong persistence, and public saving rate partially crowds out private saving rate. In addition, per capita real income growth rate and macroeconomic uncertainty have positive impact on private saving rate.",,0.0,,,Goal 17,0.02653987043968852,False,

Cherry Picking Patients: Examining the Interval Between Patient Rooming and Resident Self AssignmentAcademic Emergency Medicine,"Patterson, B. & Batt, R. & Wilbanks, M. & Otles, E. & Westergaard, M. & Shah, M",2016,,"Objective: We aimed to evaluate the association between patient chief complaint and the time interval between patient rooming and resident physician self-assignment (""pickup time""). We hypothesized that significant variation in pickup time would exist based on chief complaint, thereby uncovering resident preferences in patient presentations.

Methods: A retrospective medical record review was performed on consecutive patients at a single, academic, university-based emergency department with over 50,000 visits per year. All patients who presented from August 1, 2012, to July 31, 2013, and were initially seen by a resident were included in the analysis. Patients were excluded if not seen primarily by a resident or if registered with a chief complaint associated with trauma team activation. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The outcome measured was ""pickup time,"" defined as the time interval between room assignment and resident self-assignment. We examined all complaints with >100 visits, with the remaining complaints included in the model in an ""other"" category. A proportional hazards model was created to control for the following prespecified demographic and clinical factors: age, race, sex, arrival mode, admission vital signs, Emergency Severity Index code, waiting room time before rooming, and waiting room census at time of rooming.

Results: Of the 30,382 patients eligible for the study, the median time to pickup was 6 minutes (interquartile range = 2-15 minutes). After controlling for the above factors, we found systematic and significant variation in the pickup time by chief complaint, with the longest times for patients with complaints of abdominal problems, numbness/tingling, and vaginal bleeding and shortest times for patients with ankle injury, allergic reaction, and wrist injury.

Conclusions: A consistent variation in resident pickup time exists for common chief complaints. We suspect that this reflects residents preferentially choosing patients with simpler workups and less perceived diagnostic ambiguity. This work introduces pickup time as a metric that may be useful in the future to uncover and address potential physician bias. Further work is necessary to establish whether practice patterns in this study are carried beyond residency and persist among attendings in the community and how these patterns are shaped by the information presented via the EHR.",Crossref,0.0,10.1111/acem.12895,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.12895,Goal 3,0.01316551142233264,False,

We find that although the loss profiles are subject to great uncertainties, the official figures fall significantly below the corresponding risk statistics based on our model.

The analysis is based on the Longitudinal Employer Household dynamics from the U.S. Census Bureau. Our findings indicate that, in the context of entrepreneurship, both startups and joiners rely heavily on signals of quality.

Micro-Foundations of Firm-Specific Human Capital: When Do Employees Perceive Their Skills to be Firm-Specific?Academy of Management Journal,"Raffiee, J. & Coff, R",2016,,"Drawing on human capital theory, strategy scholars have emphasized firm-specific human capital as a source of sustained competitive advantage. In this study, we begin to unpack the micro-foundations of firm-specific human capital by theoretically and empirically exploring when employees perceive their skills to be firm-specific. We first develop theoretical arguments and hypotheses based on the extant strategy literature, which implicitly assumes information efficiency and unbiased perceptions of firm-specificity. We then relax these assumptions and develop alternative hypotheses rooted in the cognitive psychology literature, which highlights biases in human judgment. We test our hypotheses using two data sources from Korea and the United States. Surprisingly, our results support the hypotheses based on cognitive bias—a stark contrast to expectations embedded within the strategy literature. Specifically, we find organizational commitment and, to some extent, tenure are negatively related to employee perceptions of the firm-specificity. We also find that employer-provided on-the-job training is unrelated to perceived firm-specificity. These results suggest that firm-specific human capital, as perceived by employees, may drive behavior in ways unanticipated by existing theory—for example, with respect to investments in skills or turnover decisions. This, in turn, may challenge the assumed relationship between firm-specific human capital and sustained competitive advantage. More broadly, our findings may suggest a need to reconsider other theories, such as transaction cost economics, that draw heavily on firm-specificity and implicitly assume widely shared and unbiased perceptions.",Crossref,0.0,10.5465/amj.2014.0286,https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2014.0286,Goal 16,0.01720047097301063,False,

We examine both reputation and peer review as forms of self-regulation. The U.S. government recently replaced peer review of public company auditors with PCAOB oversight. This change signaled the government's dissatisfaction with peer review's ability to discipline auditor behavior. However, the AICPA continues to utilize peer review to oversee audits of private companies. We start with individual reputation as a form of self-regulation. Similar to prior research, we find reputation formation facilitates high quality sporadically across markets. We then examine whether different implementations of peer review facilitate reputation formation and high quality. A peer review treatment that requires truthful peer reports does no better than reputation alone in promoting high quality. A peer review treatment that does not require truthful peer reports generates lower quality. Finally, a peer review treatment with no truth telling constraint, but the ability to punish transgressors, generates high quality at the same rate as the reputation only treatment. We observe that up to a third of peer based reports are intentionally inaccurate suggesting the reports are used strategically.

Do Property Taxes Affect Real Operating Decisions and Market Prices for Crude Oil?Contemporary Accounting Research,"Allee, K. & Lynch, D. & Petroni, K. & Schroeder, J",2015,,"This study investigates the effect of personal property taxes (PPTs) on real business decisions. Consistent with tax avoidance, we posit that PPTs are associated with decreases (increases) in inventory prior to (following) calendar year-end assessment dates. We empirically test this prediction using monthly crude oil inventory data. We find that in locations where crude oil inventory is subject to taxation, total and refinery-level crude oil inventories are reduced prior to assessment dates and increased in the following period, when compared to locations with no tax. The results provide empirical evidence that PPTs play a role in the operating decisions of firms. We also examine the pricing implications of these taxdriven changes in crude oil inventory and find that the market seemingly adjusts crude oil prices around assessment dates demonstrating that the market acts as if it understands these changes in crude oil inventory are not simply due to supply and demand effects.",Crossref,0.0,10.1111/1911-3846.12086,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12086,Goal 7,0.00767062490431788,False,

Toward a Theory of Perceived Firm-Specific Human CapitalAcademy of Management Perspectives,"Coff, R. & Raffiee, J",2015,,"Strategy research suggests that firm-specific human capital is a source of sustained competitive advantage, at least in part because it may constrain employee mobility. However, it is also typically assumed that employees are reluctant to invest in firmspecific skills because such investments may come at the cost of developing general skills, thereby reducing their attractiveness in the labor market. This creates a theoretical paradox: Employee investment in firm-specific human capital is crucial for value creation and appropriation, yet there is believed to be global underinvestment in firmspecific skills. We argue that the logic behind this theory depends on the assumption that firm-specific human capital is accurately and objectively perceived among labor market participants and that relaxing this assumption significantly limits conclusions that can be drawn about competitive advantage. The key takeaway is that perceptions of firm specificity, even if inaccurate, can be more important than objective firm-specific human capital in determining the likelihood that firm-specific human capital can be a source of sustained advantage. By relaxing the assumption of strong-form labor market efficiency, we develop propositions regarding how firms can facilitate and manage perceptions of firm specificity, thereby increasing the likelihood that a competitive advantage can be sustained. In doing so, we help reconcile some of the differing assumptions in micro and macro work on human capital and employee retention.",Crossref,0.0,10.5465/amp.2014.0112,https://doi.org/10.5465/amp.2014.0112,Goal 8,0.01788593158305568,False,
Market Positioning by Information Technology Vendors through ImitationInformation Systems Research,"Saraf, N. & Ruckman, K. & Sambamurthy, V",2015,,"Information technology (IT) services vendors operate in a highly competitive but also institutional environment that render their service-line offerings mutually observable. This suggests that imitation of rivals' decisions can be an efficient means for IT vendors when reconfiguring their service-line offerings. To explore how such imitation unfolds in this sector, we estimate a series of logistic regression models of 116 IT vendors' serviceline choices over three time periods. First, from the strategic imitation literature we identify the key imitation ""referents,"" which is a group of firms or a single firm with specific traits, and we test the relative influence of each referent. All of our analysis includes these referents as predictors of service-line choice. Next, we tested more nuanced models using theoretically guided subsamples as follows. One, based on information systems (IS) literature, we consider the IT vendors as embedded in three distinct ""institutional spheres,"" each corresponding to a knowledge domain, namely, technical, functional, and vertical industry domains. We separately examine imitation in each subsample corresponding to the three types of service lines. Two, based on strategy literature, we consider that the influence of the imitation referents differs when the choice under consideration is the addition of a new service line versus a withdrawal. Our results across all of these subsamples uncover a nuanced pattern of imitation that sometimes contrasts the full-sample results. The most prominent result is that although imitation is highly salient, the different imitation referents are not universally influential across all knowledge domains and between development versus withdrawal decisions. Specifically, the imitation of similar firms is widespread, whereas the imitation of largest firms or offering popular service-lines, which indicates bandwagon effects, are at play only selectively.

On-Demand Delivery Platforms and Restaurant SalesManagement Science,"Li, Z. & Wang, G",2025,,"Restaurants are increasingly relying on on-demand delivery platforms (e.g., DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats) to reach customers and fulfill takeout orders. Although on-demand delivery is a valuable option for consumers, whether restaurants benefit from or are being hurt by partnering with these platforms remains unclear. This paper investigates whether and to what extent the platform delivery channel substitutes restaurants’ own takeout/dine-in channels and the net impact on restaurant revenue. Empirical analyses show that restaurants overall benefit from on-demand delivery platforms—these platforms increase restaurants’ total takeout sales while creating positive spillovers to customer dine-in visits. However, the platform effects are substantially heterogeneous, depending on the type of restaurants (independent versus chain) and the type of customer channels (takeout versus dine-in). The overall positive effect on fast-food chains is four times as large as that on independent restaurants. For takeout, delivery platforms substitute independent restaurants’ but complement chain restaurants’ own takeout sales. For dine-in, delivery platforms increase both independent and chain restaurants’ dine-in visits by a similar magnitude. Therefore, the value of delivery platforms to independent restaurants mostly comes from the increase in dine-in visits, whereas the value to chain restaurants primarily comes from the gain in takeout sales. Further, the platform delivery channel facilitates price competition and reduces the opportunity for independent restaurants to differentiate with premium services and dine-in experience, which may explain why independent restaurants do not benefit as much from on-demand delivery platforms.

Regulating Powerful Platforms: Evidence from Commission Fee CapsInformation Systems Research,"Li, Z. & Wang, G",2025,,"Digital platforms have become increasingly dominant in many industries, bringing the concerns of adverse economic and societal effects (e.g., monopolies and social inequality). Regulators are actively seeking diverse strategies to regulate these powerful platforms. However, the lack of empirical studies hinders the progress toward evidence-based policymaking. This research investigates the regulatory landscape in the context of on-demand delivery, where high commission fees charged by the platforms significantly impact small businesses. Recent regulatory scrutiny has started to cap the commission fees for independent restaurants. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of platform fee regulation by utilizing regulations across 14 cities and states in the United States. Our analyses unveil an unintended consequence: independent restaurants, the intended beneficiaries of the regulation, experience a decline in orders and revenue, whereas chain restaurants gain an advantage. We show that the platforms’ discriminative responses to the regulation, such as prioritizing chain restaurants in customer recommendations and increasing delivery fees for consumers, may explain the negative effects on independent restaurants.

Growing Platforms by Adding Complementors without A ContractInformation Systems Research,"Mayya, R. & Li, Z",2025,,"Practitioner-Oriented Abstract Online platforms often face challenges in sustaining growth, especially in competitive markets such as food delivery. This paper examines a novel strategy in which platforms list nonpartnered restaurants, allowing consumers to order from them via third-party deliverers. Whereas these restaurants gain visibility without paying commissions, concerns arise about potential harm because of lack of control over menus and pricing. We analyze the impact of this strategy using data from Grubhub and a California policy change that banned nonpartnered listings. We find that being listed as nonpartnered boosts takeout revenue for these restaurants, particularly independent ones. Additionally, there’s a positive spillover effect on partnered restaurants. However, regulatory delisting reverses these gains, highlighting the delicate balance between platform growth strategies and regulatory actions. For platform owners, this study underscores the potential of noncontracted partnerships as a growth strategy, especially if there are third-party enablers on the platform such as deliverers. However, it also cautions against potential disruptions from regulatory changes, urging businesses to adapt their strategies accordingly. For restaurant owners, our finding emphasizes the importance of adapting to changes by enhancing operational readiness to capitalize on increased visibility. They should advocate for regulations that enhance their choices and overall transparency, not inadvertently decrease them. Policy-Oriented Abstract In the competitive landscape of online platforms, the pursuit of growth often necessitates innovative strategies. Whereas such strategies are deemed controversial and get pushbacks from some participants, how should policymakers respond? This research provides insights into such a scenario by investigating a novel growth strategy in which food delivery platforms onboarded nonpartnered restaurants, enabling consumer interactions without formal contracts, promising an increased visibility without commission fees. Leveraging data from Grubhub and a policy change in California, we find that being listed boosts takeout revenue significantly, especially for independent restaurants, with positive spillovers on partnered restaurants. However, delisting reverses these gains. For policymakers, these findings challenge the narrative that nonpartnered listings are inherently harmful. They highlight the potential of such arrangements to increase market access and revenue, particularly for independent businesses. However, the study also underscores the need for balanced regulation. Whereas protecting restaurants is crucial, overly restrictive policies can limit their choices and growth opportunities. We recommend a policy approach that empowers restaurants by requiring platforms to obtain explicit consent before listing them. Additionally, enhancing transparency around nonpartnered listings and associated fees can enable customers to make informed choices. This approach fosters a fair market, preserving the benefits of platform-enabled growth for all stakeholders.",Crossref,81.1881188118812,10.1287/isre.2023.0237,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2023.0237,Goal 2,0.04746939043335371,False,food markets; food policy solutions; food security
"Channel Structures for a Dual-Purpose Firm: Direct, Retail, or Hybrid?Production and Operations Management","Wang, N. & Li, Z",2025,,"The advance in e-commerce has provided firms with more options when designing their channel structures. The rise of “beyond profit” managerial doctrine has also added complexity to channel design. Extending the literature in distribution channels that focuses on for-profit firms, this paper develops a stylized model to examine the channel design problem for a socially responsible manufacturer who pursues a dual-purpose objective—the manufacturer values both profit and consumer surplus. We compare three channel structures: Direct selling (centralization), retailing only (decentralization), and the hybrid of both the direct and indirect channels. We show that double marginalization rooted in the retail channel can alleviate the manufacturer’s loss in profit due to her pursuit of consumer surplus. Thus, compared to direct selling, retailing only may lead to a higher profit for the manufacturer (even when the manufacturer’s direct channel is as efficient as the retail channel) and a higher conversion efficiency in boosting consumer surplus at the expense of the manufacturer’s profit. In the hybrid channel analysis, we show that the manufacturer’s pursuit of consumer surplus leads to upward distortion of direct sales. Facing competition from direct sales, the retailer becomes less sensitive to the wholesale price, and the manufacturer has to reduce the wholesale price significantly to boost the retailer’s order quantity, leading to serious downward wholesale price distortion when the consumer focus is high. Counterintuitively, we find that as the selling cost disadvantage in direct selling increases, the manufacturer with a higher consumer focus increases the wholesale price to rely more on direct selling. We also find that the hybrid structure may cause loss in profit due to price and quantity distortions, leading to lower manufacturer utility and conversion efficiency compared to the single-channel structures. We also provide several extensions to show the robustness of our main findings and offer further insights for channel design for dual-purpose organizations.",Crossref,93.93939393939394,10.1177/10591478251317454,https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478251317454,Goal 12,0.01174479022577432,False,

Integrating the expectation states theory and multidimensional perspectives of agentic perceptions, we found that fostering perceived leader competence attenuated the dominance penalty. Across four studies, including two multiwave, multisource field studies (Studies 1 and 3), a critical incident experiment (Study 2a), and a vignette experiment (Study 2b), we observed the dominance penalty at lower but not higher levels of perceived leader competence. Perceived leader status mediated these effects so that higher (vs. lower) levels of perceived leader dominance led to less favorable leader status and effectiveness evaluations for women (but not for men) leaders, and these gender differences were eliminated at higher levels of perceived leader competence.

Delinquent credit balances doubled in areas with the worst flooding, although nonflooded areas also had significant credit impairments. Only independent businesses showed signs of distress; subsidiaries of larger firms did not. Firms were largely uninsured and often were denied credit postdisaster.

Fair Lending in Car Financing: Unintended Racial Consequences of CFPB Supervision of Dealer MarkupsJournal of Marketing Research,"He, C. & Ozturk, O. & Chintagunta , P",2025,,"Over 80% of car buyers in the United States obtain a loan through a dealership. Dealers often mark up lender-provided interest rates (buy rates), but consumers cannot distinguish these markups from total rates. In 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau made an unprecedented public disclosure regarding its supervision of auto lenders, revealing racial disparities in dealer markups disadvantaging minority borrowers. The Bureau strongly recommended—but did not mandate—that lenders providing loans through dealers eliminate dealer discretion in markups by adopting flat dealer compensation per transaction. The authors examine the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing consumer financing, car payments, and the racial gap. Using detailed individual transaction-level data and a regression-discontinuity-in-time design, they find that dealer markups declined by 5.55 basis points after the intervention, saving $66.60 for a typical loan. However, the intervention also increased buy rates, resulting in no significant changes to consumers’ total interest rates and total payments. Dealers experienced a slight increase in financing profits but no significant change in vehicle profits. Importantly, the racial gap in dealer markups and total interest rates widened ; dealer markups decreased for both minorities and nonminorities, but they decreased more for nonminorities. The findings can illuminate the intended and unintended consequences of such government oversight and provide insights into their underlying mechanisms.",Crossref,80.97560975609755,10.1177/00222437251352482,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437251352482,Goal 10,0.01164761050524003,False,

Understanding mobile data cost is a global and industry-wide concern as the perception of this cost is common in both developed and developing countries, and even subtle behavioral shifts because of this cost can have significant impacts given the prevalence of mobile shopping. Using hotel search data, we find that consumers are approximately twice as price sensitive when using mobile data compared with Wi-Fi, leading to an average revenue reduction of $17 per hotel booking. Additionally, consumer search effort decreases across decision stages when using mobile data rather than Wi-Fi, showing that mobile data users pursue satisfactory options without extensive search effort, obtain less product information, and therefore rely more on price information, becoming more price sensitive. This study provides implications for mobile shopping environments in which limited mobile data plans are common, suggesting that firms should consider consumers’ connectivity types in marketing strategies, offer data subsidies to encourage more thorough searches, and develop customized recommendations and app versions for mobile data users and that policymakers should monitor potential price discrimination to protect consumer interests.",Crossref,97.70114942528735,10.1287/isre.2023.0450,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2023.0450,Goal 9,0.04738823083858762,False,
From Food Deserts to Fresh Food: The Role of Digital Accessibility in Nutrition Assistance ProgramsManagement Science,"He, C. & Li, Z",2025,,"One in 10 U.S. households experience food insecurity, with millions of low-income families lacking access to fresh food. In response, federal and state governments recently launched the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Online Purchasing Pilot (SNAP Online), enabling SNAP benefits to cover online food purchases. Although prior research suggests that the SNAP Online program may increase overall food consumption, its impact on fresh food consumption remains unclear. This research leverages NielsenIQ consumer panel data and employs a Difference-in-Differences approach to address this question. Our findings reveal that the SNAP Online program increases fresh food consumption among low-income households by 7.1%. However, the effect is minimal in areas with limited access to online grocery delivery and among households with poor prior fresh food consumption habits. These results underscore the potential of supply-side policies, such as expanding online purchasing options, to improve fresh food consumption. They also highlight the importance of addressing demand-side barriers and enhancing digital accessibility to maximize the effectiveness of nutrition assistance programs.

Transfer Learning in the Actuarial Domain: Foundations and Applications,"Kim, Y. & Bauer, D",2025,,"With increasing data availability, the use of machine learning methods has gained popularity in insurance. Applications include novel areas for the use of models, for instance for automating business processes, as well as conventional actuarial prediction tasks such as claims or loss prediction.

In other fields, transfer learning has been proposed as a potential solution in similar contexts. Transfer learning refers to taking the knowledge from one problem and applying it to a new but related problem, which can reduce the cost of collecting additional labeled data and improve the model performance. In this article, various transfer learning approaches are introduced and applied to publicly available insurance data sets.

Backup plans: The impact of disclosure on perceptions of expert competenceManagement Science,"Palmeira, M. & Polman, E",2025,,"People often consult experts to provide solutions to their problems. Oftentimes, an initial attempt to solve a problem fails, and these experts (e.g., advisors, consultants, specialists, and service providers) will resort to a backup plan. A backup plan can be presented when it is needed (i.e., after an initial failure) or in advance (i.e., before a potential failure). We examine how the timing of disclosure of a backup plan affects judgments of an expert’s competence. We show that although people expect experts to have a backup plan, they react more negatively if it is presented after (versus before) it is needed, all things equal. This “competence penalty” disappears when people are prompted to think about what an expert would do in case of failure as indeed, an alternative plan is expected. Importantly, our findings indicate that there is no competence penalty for early disclosure of a backup plan, regardless of the outcome of the initial plan: if it has failed, has succeeded, or is still ongoing. However, we do find one exception; early disclosure has a negative impact if multiple backup plans are disclosed while the initial plan is in progress.

Investor Perceptions of the Corporate Alternative Minimum TaxManagement Science,"Gaertner, F. & Hoopes, J. & Kelley, S. & Pflitsch, M",2025,,"The Inflation Reduction Act establishes a new 15% corporate minimum tax on the adjusted financial accounting income for large U.S. corporations. Although the minimum tax is estimated to raise $222 billion over 10 years, some fear firms will manipulate their accounting earnings to reduce their tax liabilities, resulting in less revenue raised. Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax. Instead, they appear to expect a significant portion of the corporate minimum tax to be remitted by firms and borne by shareholders. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.

When Training Hurts Quality: Evidence from Nursing HomesManagement Science,"Wang, C. & Batt, R. & Bavafa, H",2025,,"The relationship between workforce training and service quality is a central concern in operations management. We examine this relationship in the context of nursing homes, where Certified Nurse Assistants (CNAs) provide most direct care. CNAs play a critical role in providing daily care to nursing home residents, yet questions remain about whether current training requirements are adequate. This study examines how CNA training hours affect nursing home quality and staffing. While federal regulations mandate a minimum of 75 training hours, including both clinical and classroom components, several states have adopted higher standards. The causal impact of these increased training hours on nursing home outcomes is not well understood. Leveraging variation in state training requirements from 2009 to 2017, we employ a difference-indifferences approach to estimate the effects of training hours on staffing and quality outcomes. Contrary to policy expectations, we find that increased training hours are associated with declines in quality, including an 8.8% increase in deficiency citations. Staffing patterns also shift: while the total CNA staffing remains unchanged, the full-time CNA hours decline by 4.3% and part-time CNA hours increase by 7.7%.

Mortgage Lenders’ Diversity Policies and Mortgage Lending to Minorities,"Feng, R. & Shanthikumar, D. & Zhang, D",2025,,"Research suggests that minorities continue to face lower mortgage application approval rates, and, if approved, higher interest rates. At the same time, research suggests that disparities between minority and white borrowers have narrowed in recent years. We examine the role of diversity policies in addressing mortgage lending disparities, using both within-lender analyses and an event study design. We find that diversity policies significantly reduce race-related gaps in borrowing costs, captured by effective interest rate spreads. However, they drive larger gaps in approval rates. Additional analyses provide insights into the mechanisms through which diversity policies affect loan costs and approval rates. The increase in application completion rates and the reduction in loan costs, both driven by the front office, are in part driven by better matching of borrower and loan officer race. The reduction in approval rates is in part driven by an increase in higher-risk loan applications from minority borrowers. However, the increase in risk does not fully explain the approval rate effect, suggesting an overreaction from the back office-in which the back office increases approval standards for minorities. Examination of ex post loan performance is consistent with an overreaction, with a significant decrease in ex post defaults and an increase in prepayment from minority borrowers. Together, our results suggest that diversity policies in part address racerelated disparities in lending. However, the policies also induce wider loan approval gaps.

Warnings and Endorsements: Improving Human-AI Collaboration in the Presence of Outliers,"Disorbo, M. & Ferreira, K. & Balakrishnan, M. & Tong, J",2025,,"Problem definition: Whereas artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may perform well on data that are representative of the training set (inliers), they may err when extrapolating on nonrepresentative data (outliers). How can humans and algorithms work together to make better decisions when faced with outliers and inliers? Methodology/results: We study a human–AI collaboration on prediction tasks using a bias adjustment framework and hypothesize that humans tend toward naïve adjusting behavior: humans make adjustments to AI predictions that are too similar across inliers and outliers when, ideally, adjustments should be larger on outliers than inliers. In an online experiment, we demonstrate that participants are indeed unable to sufficiently differentiate their adjustments to an AI algorithm when faced with both inliers and outliers, leading to a 143%–176% increase in their absolute deviation from the optimal prediction compared with participants facing either all inliers or all outliers. We design a warning (an endorsement) that alerts participants when feature values constitute outliers (inliers), and in a second experiment, we show that this warning (endorsement) helps participants differentiate adjustments, reducing their absolute deviation from the optimal prediction by an average of 35% (28%). Deploying both interventions together reduces participants’ absolute deviation from the optimal prediction by 49%. In a third experiment, we demonstrate the robustness of warnings and endorsements in the presence of “fringeliers”—data points with features marginally outside the range of the training data set.

Human-Algorithm Collaboration with Private Information: Naïve Advice Weighting Behavior and MitigationManagement Science,"Balakrishnan, M. & Ferreira, K. & Tong, J",2025,,"Even if algorithms make better predictions than humans on average, humans may sometimes have private information that an algorithm does not have access to that can improve performance. How can we help humans effectively use and adjust recommendations made by algorithms in such situations? When deciding whether and how to override an algorithm’s recommendations, we hypothesize that people are biased toward following naïve advice-weighting (NAW) behavior; they take a weighted average between their own prediction and the algorithm’s prediction, with a constant weight across prediction instances regardless of whether they have valuable private information. This leads to humans overadhering to the algorithm’s predictions when their private information is valuable and underadhering when it is not. In an online experiment where participants were tasked with making demand predictions for 20 products while having access to an algorithm’s predictions, we confirm this bias toward NAW and find that it leads to a 20%–61% increase in prediction error. In a second experiment, we find that feature transparency—even when the underlying algorithm is a black box—helps users more effectively discriminate how to deviate from algorithms, resulting in a 25% reduction in prediction error. We make further improvements in a third experiment via an intervention designed to move users away from advice weighting and instead, use only their private information to inform deviations, leading to a 34% reduction in prediction error.

Conversely, a risk-averse person may value insurance below its expected value and appear risk loving when premiums are due in a single payment.

"Making Choices: A Multi-institutional, Longitudinal Cohort Study Assessing Changes in Treatment Outcome Valuation for Low-risk Thyroid CancerAnnals of Surgery","Antunez, A. & Sinco, B. & Saucke, M. & Sydnor, J",2025,,"Objective:
To evaluate the relative importance of treatment outcomes to patients with low-risk thyroid cancer (TC).
Background:
Overuse of total thyroidectomy (TT) for low-risk TC is common. Emotions from a cancer diagnosis may lead patients to choose TT, resulting in outcomes that do not align with their preferences.
Methods:
Adults with clinically low-risk TC enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional, longitudinal cohort study from November 2019 to June 2021. Participants rated treatment outcomes at the time of their surgical decision and again 9 months later by allocating 100 points among 10 outcomes. t tests and Hotelling T 2 statistic compared outcome valuation within and between subjects based on chosen extent of surgery (TT vs lobectomy).
Results:
Of 177 eligible patients, 125 participated (70.6% response) and 114 completed the 9-month follow-up (91.2% retention). At the time of the treatment decision, patients choosing TT valued the risk of recurrence more than those choosing lobectomy and the need to take thyroid hormone less (P< 0.05). At repeat valuation, all patients assigned fewer points to cancer being removed and the impact of treatment on their voice and more points to energy levels (P< 0.05). The importance of the risk of recurrence increased for those who chose lobectomy and decreased for those choosing TT (P< 0.05).

We find that KAMs are greater in number than CAMs, and while both usually address similar core topics, KAMs cover a wider array. KAM disclosures also tend to be longer, convey a greater sense of uncertainty, and describe more audit procedures that the engagement team used to address the matter (s).

AI–Human Hybrids for Marketing Research: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as CollaboratorsJournal of Marketing,"Arora, N. & Chakraborty, I. & Nishimura, Y",2025,,"The authors’ central premise is that a human–LLM (large language model) hybrid approach leads to efficiency and effectiveness gains in the marketing research process. In qualitative research, they show that LLMs can assist in both data generation and analysis; LLMs effectively create sample characteristics, generate synthetic respondents, and conduct and moderate in-depth interviews. The AI–human hybrid generates information-rich, coherent data that surpasses human-only data in depth and insightfulness and matches human performance in data analysis tasks of generating themes and summaries. Evidence from expert judges shows that humans and LLMs possess complementary skills; the human–LLM hybrid outperforms its human-only or LLM-only counterpart. For quantitative research, the LLM correctly picks the answer direction and valence, with the quality of synthetic data significantly improving through few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation. The authors demonstrate the value of the AI–human hybrid by collaborating with a Fortune 500 food company and replicating a 2019 qualitative and quantitative study using GPT-4.

This study synthesizes insights from fieldwork interviews, the marketing and strategic management literature, and focus groups with managers to enhance understanding of why implementing marketing strategy is so hard. In delineating important components of marketing strategy implementation, mapping the strategy implementation process, and identifying new causes of common problems inherent in the resulting understanding of the marketing strategy implementation phenomenon, our study offers an explanation for frequently observed gaps between “intended” and “realized” marketing strategy. Strategy implementation is revealed as a complex phenomenon that involves inherent trade-offs between different aspects and stages of implementation, making “silver bullet” solutions to commonly observed marketing strategy implementation problems unlikely.

The paradox of explaining: When feeling unknowledgeable prevents learners from engaging in effective learning strategies,"Atir, S. & Risen, J",2025,,"People often need to learn complex information as part of their daily lives. One of the most effective strategies for understanding information is to explain it, for instance to a hypothetical other (Pilots 1 and 2). Yet, we find that learners prefer equally effortful but less effective learning strategies, even when incentivized to perform well (Study 1). Critically, we propose and find that learners' reluctance to explain is tied to their subjective knowledge of the material; learners who feel less knowledgeable about what they learned are most reluctant to explain it, despite the strategy being as effective for them (Study 2). An intervention that increased subjective knowledge (by having learners answer a few easy questions) increased learners' choice to explain, which was mediated by learners believing that explaining would be more pleasant and effective (Study 3). Directly manipulating beliefs about how fun and effective explaining is also boosted learners' willingness to explain (Study 4). Finally, because Studies 1-4 incentivized performance financially, we replicated key results in the classroom with students, finding improved scores on a class quiz (Study 5). The paradoxical implication of these findings is that those who need effective learning strategies the most are the ones least likely to use them. Put together, we find that subjective knowledge plays a key role in learning decisions and that boosting subjective knowledge is a simple intervention that can improve learning-related choices.

Profit Implications of Judgmental Adjustments to ForecastInputs: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field ExperimentManagement Science,"Kesavan, S. & Kushwaha, T. & Steele, D",2025,,"In this paper, we report the results from a large-scale field experiment at a spare parts retail chain that considers whether allowing merchants to override forecast inputs to an inventory algorithm improves profits. Although the judgmental forecasting literature has studied extensively whether judgmental adjustments improve forecast performance, causal empirical evidence is missing in regard to whether judgmental adjustments improve bottom-line profits. Our results show that judgmental adjustments to the forecast input increase profitability by 4.92% on average compared with relying on automation without human intervention. We find that the well-established motivation-opportunity-ability framework provides clear insight into when judgmental adjustments improve profits, by examining heterogeneity in our data regarding stock-keeping unit margin, lifecycle, and size of supplier. Our data set also allows for examining both forecast accuracy and profits.

Cooking or Clicking: The Impact of Online Food Delivery Platforms on Domestic Food PreparationManagement Science,"Babar, Y. & Adeli, A. & Greenwood, B",2025,,"One of the most notable developments of the sharing economy is the unfettered proliferation of on-demand services. In this work, we examine how a subset of such platforms, online food delivery (e.g., Grubhub, UberEats, DoorDash), has affected the meal preparation and dining behaviors of American households. To do so, we exploit the phased entry of the platform Grubhub into U.S. counties from 2005 to 2019 using a difference-in-difference approach. Results indicate that the availability of such delivery services leads to a significant reduction in time spent preparing meals within the home, with no concomitant change in dining out. This effect is intensified in areas subject to greater demand and in areas with a greater number of restaurants but abates when less economically feasible (i.e., in areas with higher unemployment and households with more children).

A summer of protests: Using event system theory to test an intersectional leadership advantageJournal of Management,"Stajkovic, A. & Stajkovic, K",2024,,"Widespread social unrest occurred in the United States in the Summer of 2020. Citizens took to the streets to challenge the prevailing social justice framework. According to event systemstheory, these Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests were high-strength, as they represented novel, critical, and disruptive events. They were also mega-threats as they focused on threats to the social identities of the marginalized communities. Because different approaches were taken in navigating the BLM protests by authorities, it was unclear what constitutes effective leadership during these events. We integrate insights from event-oriented literature with intersectionality of gender and race research to introduce an intersectional leadership advantage (ILA). This framework suggests that Black women, owing in part to the rich tapestry of their social experiences, tend to develop a distinct leadership style characterized by sensitivity to racial injustice, leaning into risk, and commitment to the community. These qualities enable Black women leaders to be effective during events like BLM protests. Utilizing data from six public sources covering 11,540 protests across 3,338 U.S. cities from May to August 2020, we hypothesized an interaction of city police chiefs’ gender and race in relation to protest-related violence (measured in three ways).

We find that before the mid-1980s, the Federal Reserve adhered to Friedman’s policy of a steady money growth, operating with no interest rate smoothing. In contrast, after the mid-1980s, the Fed transitioned to a Taylor rule that incorporated generalized interest rate smoothing and began relying on forward-looking indicators from financial and housing markets. The interest rate smoothing and the use of these indicators helped to reduce inflation and unemployment volatility, with the smoothing potentially reflecting the application of a Kalman-style information filter to improve data processing.

Continued Use Trajectories: How Entropy Work Sustains Technology AssemblagesJournal of Marketing,"Franco, P. & Epp, A. & Canniford, R. & Phipps, M",2024,,"Why do some technology products enjoy enduring continued use, whereas others are quickly discarded? Existing marketing research explains that continued use is motivated by cost–benefit decisions over how useful and easy to use a tech product is. Yet the interconnected nature of contemporary technologies means that continued use can depend on tech products’ capacities to interact with other devices, objects, infrastructures, and people as parts of assemblages that generate useful properties. By analyzing interview and observational data of technology consumption through the lens of assemblage theory, the authors identify four continued use trajectories. These explain different paths from adoption to discontinued use by distinguishing component parts’ capacities to interact and hold assemblages together to sustain emergent properties. In each trajectory, continued use is sustained by entropy work to support a tech product's usefulness and ease of use. The authors consider implications of entropy work for theories of continued use and broader marketing scholarship, and offer recommendations to help firms manage the opportunities and risks that accompany different continued use trajectories.",Crossref,91.42857142857143,10.1177/00222429241255306,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222429241255306,Goal 9,0.01783326833311014,False,domestic technology development; technological progress; technological support; technological upgrading
When Fields are Destabilized: Mobilizing Gendered Capital to Resolve HysteresisJournal of Consumer Research,"Velagaleti, S. & Epp, A",2024,,"Abstract In the fight for legitimacy, understanding the rules of status games is critical. This idea holds true in the wedding marketplace. However, when legalization of marriage for same-sex couples disrupted the binary wedding script, the rules of the game became less clear to consumers. Couples sometimes found their gendered bodies, roles, and expressions were out of sync with the evolving script of a destabilized wedding field, thus raising legitimacy questions. This situation is defined as hysteresis—meaning delays in the realignment between habitus and the field. Hysteresis results in consumers’ disorientation about what forms of capital are valued as well as perceived absences of materials or recognition from the market. This study investigates consumers’ attempts to mobilize gendered capital to resolve hysteresis through realignment of habitus and the script. Grounded in a Bourdieuian field-level analysis of depth interviews with 30 same-sex couples and ethnographic observation in the wedding field, four consumption alignment strategies are identified that consumers leverage to address hysteresis: confronting, masking, collaborating, and experimenting. Consumers’ variations in gendered capital explain which consumption alignment strategies they use, with different possibilities for updating habitus and expanding the script. Throughout this process, consumers’ moral judgments hinder this pursuit.",Crossref,89.5104895104895,10.1093/jcr/ucad038,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad038,Goal 12,0.008473739798611529,False,consumer behavior

Psychological Predictors of Socioeconomic Resilience Amidst the Covid-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Machine LearningAmerican Psychologist,"Sheetal, A. & Ma, A. & Infurna, F",2024,,"What predicts cross-country differences in the recovery of socioeconomic activity from the Covid-19 pandemic? To answer this question, we examined how quickly countries’ socioeconomic activity bounced back to normalcy from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic based on residents’ attitudes, values, and beliefs as measured in the World Values Survey (WVS). We trained nine pre-registered machine learning models to predict the rate at which various socioeconomic metrics (e.g., public transportation occupancy, cinema attendance) recovered from their Covid-19 lows based on the WVS. All models had high predictive accuracy when presented with out-of-sample data (r’s &gt;=.83). Feature importance analyses identified five psychological predictors that most strongly predicted socioeconomic recovery from Covid-19: religiosity, liberal social attitudes, the value of independence, obedience to authority, and the Protestant work ethic. Although past research has established the role of religiosity, liberalism, and independence in predicting resilience, it has not yet considered obedience to authority or the Protestant work ethic. Thus, the current research suggests new directions for future work on resilience that may not be apparent from either a deductive or an inductive approach.",Crossref,95.85253456221199,10.31234/osf.io/d7x5c,https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/d7x5c,Goal 1,0.03427006643814692,False,COVID-19 impact; resilience building
Threats to personal control fuel similarity attractionProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Ma, A. & Paek, J. & Liu, F. & Kim, J",2024,,"We propose that experiencing a lack of personal control will increase people’s preferences for self-similar others and that this effect would be explained by a greater need for structure. Our hypotheses received support across 11 longitudinal, experimental, and archival studies composed of data from 60 countries (5 preregistered studies, N = 90,216). In an analysis of cross-country archival data, we found that respondents who indicated a lower sense of personal control were less likely to prefer to live with neighbors who had a different religion, race, or spoke a different language (Study 1). Study 2 found that participants who perceived lower (vs. higher) personal control indicated greater liking for coworkers who they perceived to be more self-similar across a wide range of characteristics (e.g., gender, personality). Studies 3a and 3b, two live-interaction experiments conducted in the United States and China, provided additional causal evidence for control-motivated similarity attraction. A causal experimental chain (Studies 4a to 4c) and a manipulation-of-mediation-as-a-moderator study (Study 5) provided evidence for the mediating effects of the need for structure. Study 6, a longitudinal study with Chinese employees, found that workers who reported perceiving a lower (vs. higher) sense of personal control preferred more self-similar coworkers, and this effect was mediated by a greater desire for structure. Finally, exploring downstream consequences, Studies 7a and 7b found that control-motivated similarity attraction was associated with a greater preference for homogenous (vs. diverse) groups. These findings highlight how the fundamental motive for personal control shapes the structure of social life.",Crossref,88.65979381443299,10.1073/pnas.2321189121,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321189121,Goal 5,0.01689138093067152,False,
Asking for less (but receiving more): Women avoid impasses and outperform men when negotiators have weak alternatives,"Ma, A. & Ponce de Leon, R. & Rosette, A",2024,,"Both research and conventional wisdom suggest that, due to their relational orientation, women are less likely than men to engage in agentic and assertive behaviors, leading them to underperform in zero-sum, distributive negotiations where one party's gain is equivalent to the other party's loss. However, past research tends to neglect the costs of reaching impasse by excluding impasses from measures of negotiation performance. Departing from this convention, we incorporate the economic costs of impasses into measures of negotiation performance to provide a more holistic examination of negotiation outcomes. In so doing, we reveal a reversal of the oft-cited male performance advantage when obtaining an impasse is especially economically costly (as is the case when negotiators have weak negotiation alternatives). Specifically, we predicted that female negotiators would make less assertive first offers than men due to their more relational orientation and that these gender differences in offer assertiveness should result in women avoiding impasse more often than men. Since avoiding impasses should improve negotiation performance when negotiators are able to obtain a deal that is more valuable than their negotiation alternative, women's tendency to avoid impasses should improve their performance when negotiators have weak (vs. strong) alternatives. These predictions were supported in eight studies (three preregistered) across various negotiation contexts, comprising data from the television show Shark Tank (Study 1), four incentive-compatible negotiation simulations (Studies 2 and 3, Supplemental Studies), and a multistudy causal experimental chain (Supplemental Studies 4a-c).

Multitasking over Time: The Time-dependent Effects of Multitasking,"Batt, R. & Gallino, S",2024,,"This paper explores agent multitasking over time in customer service environments, particularly within livechat settings. Multitasking, a ubiquitous occurrence in various professional sectors, is typically assumed to have a constant effect conditional on the multitasking level. We go beyond this conventional approach by examining the temporal dynamics of multitasking and their effects on performance. Through a collaboration with a third-party customer contact center, we analyze livechat interactions across different retail brands, focusing on both multitasking and multibranding, where agents manage tasks for multiple brands simultaneously. Our findings reveal that handling multiple chats simultaneously increases the average chat duration, with diminishing marginal increases as the number of concurrent tasks grows. We explore the implications of these insights by proposing a “pile-on” heuristic, which assigns new tasks to agents already engaged in multitasking, rather than evenly distributing tasks across agents. This method can lead to a reduction in average chat duration and increased agent idle time. Our study contributes to the operations management literature by illustrating the dynamic nature of multitasking, challenging traditional perceptions and suggesting that the duration and intensity of multitasking play crucial roles in shaping operational efficiency, and we show how work assignment strategies can influence operational outcomes.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4823942,Goal 8,0.006085760033854799,False,

These patterns are evident in both cross-sectional and panel data, when instrumenting for pollution using distant coal-fired plants upwind of cities or thermal inversions that trap pollution. Consistent with the prediction of Becker’s “quantity-quality” (Q-Q) model of fertility, we find that the fertility choices of people who tend to have higher demand for child quality are significantly more sensitive to pollution changes. Pollution does not have a meaningful effect on the fertility decisions of ethnic minorities, which can also be explained under the Q-Q framework.

The merits of securities litigation and corporate reputationContemporary Accounting Research,"Donelson, D. & Kartapanis, A. & Yust, C",2024,,"Abstract We explore how securities litigation affects corporate reputation. Experts remain concerned that nonmeritorious securities class actions—those that will be dismissed or settled for nuisance amounts—cause reputational damage. Although several prior studies show reputational costs for nonmeritorious cases, they generally use indirect measures based on returns or total market losses, which are mechanically associated with securities litigation elements. In contrast, we use a relatively direct reputation measure from Fortune 's “Most Admired Companies” list. We find significant reputational damage after meritorious litigation, with the strongest cases having the largest effects. However, we find no evidence of reputational damage after nonmeritorious litigation. We also find that Fortune 's reputational damage measure is associated with more negative returns around the litigation filing date. We show possible mechanisms for our results, as initial legal filings contain information allowing market participants to assess case merits. Our results imply that reputational damage is primarily due to fraud, which securities litigation helps reveal to the market, rather than litigation itself. Thus, reputational damage is not an issue in over 70% of securities class actions due to the high frequency of nonmeritorious cases.",Crossref,89.90825688073394,10.1111/1911-3846.12907,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12907,Goal 10,0.005382700060732198,False,

After litigation, they decrease tax avoidance activities, relative to matched control firms. Peer firms in the same industry as sued firms similarly reduce their level of tax avoidance and the likelihood of extreme tax avoidance after the litigation, relative to control firms.

How Are Flood Risks Managed in the United States?Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance,"Zhang, D",2024,,"Flooding remains the most destructive and costliest in the United States. Among the 371 billion-dollar climate disasters in the United States since 1980, 288 (78%) is directly related to flooding. Floods cost $1.37 trillion in losses (in U.S. 2023 dollars adjusted by the Consumer Price Index [CPI]) and caused 9,722 fatalities. With climate change and sea levels rising, floods are becoming more and more frequent and costly. The pressing issue is how to manage flood risk. The current risk management framework in the United States, designed and implemented by the federal government, has three fundamental pillars: flood risk information infrastructure, flood insurance, and government aid. The first pillar, the flood risk information infrastructure, guides decision-making using Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood maps that visually depict flood risks. The second pillar, flood insurance, managed by the National Flood Insurance Program since 1968, aids in addressing ex ante flood-related financial risks. The third pillar, government aid, provides postflood support through programs such as FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program and the Small Business Administration’s disaster loans. Though vital for flood risk mitigation and economic decision-making, each pillar confronts multiple challenges. FEMA flood maps face challenges in mapping accuracy, regular updating, and coverage, suggesting a need for ongoing innovation and cooperation among government agencies, research entities, and private sectors. FEMA flood insurance has its issues as well. Its premium, marked by a multifaceted risk-rating system, often doesn’t mirror actual loss potential, leading to criticisms. Despite its role as a financial buffer, flood insurance’s limited coverage and low adoption rates highlight public reluctance about it. Government aid, meant for postdisaster recovery, carries unintended side effects such as spatial discrepancies, increased inequalities, and potential deterrence from buying insurance, underscoring the delicate balance between policies and societal impacts. Furthermore, the interplay between the three pillars also creates enormous complexity in practice and may create unintended consequences. One example is the free-riding problem due to the coexistence of ex ante flood insurance and ex post government aid. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive overview of the flood risk management system for both academics and policymakers.",Crossref,91.11111111111111,10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.925,https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.925,Goal 13,0.0638657344974234,True,climate disasters; disaster risk reduction; floods; rising sea levels
"Cracking Down, Pricing Up: Housing Supply in the Wake of Mass Deportation","Howard, T. & Wang, M. & Zhang, D",2024,,"US housing markets have faced a secular shortage of housing supply in the past decade, contributing to a steady decline in housing affordability. Most supply-side explanations in the literature have tended to focus on the distortionary effect of local housing regulations. This paper provides novel evidence on the interplay between residential construction, labor supplied to the construction industry, and immigration policy. We exploit the staggered rollout of a national increase in immigration enforcement to identify negative shocks to construction sector employment that are likely unrelated to local housing market conditions. Treated counties experience large and persistent reductions in construction workforce, residential homebuilding, and increases in home prices. Further, evidence suggests that undocumented labor is a complement to domestic labor: an indirect outcome of deporting undocumented construction workers is net job loss for US-born workers, especially in higher-skilled occupations. We find that any demand-side downward pressure on home prices linked to increased deportations is temporary and quickly dominated by the supply-side impact.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),100.0,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4729511,Goal 8,0.028327953340573,False,

In a survey, respondents describe various uses of AI at their companies, spanning from simple to complex functions. While managers are not averse to the use of AI by their companies or their auditors, they appear to be uncertain about how auditors’ use of AI will directly benefit their companies. In an experiment that manipulates whether a company and/or its auditor use AI, managers whose companies use AI record larger audit adjustments for a complex accounting estimate when the auditor uses AI. Auditor AI use does not affect managers’ adjustment decisions in the absence of company AI.

Two Heads are Better than One: Task Division and Decision Control in Inventory PlanningProduction and Operations Management,"Park, Y. & Lee, Y. & Siemsen, E",2024,,"We examine when and how task division improves performance for inventory planning. Specifically, we consider a decentralized inventory management context with two interdependent subtasks: preparing a forecast and setting a service level. Using a behavioral experiment, we reveal that the task challenge moderates the relationship between task division and performance. Our findings indicate that task division improves performance when the task becomes more challenging, such as under high demand uncertainty.

Newer methods, such as machine learning, are inherently complex. The more traditional families of forecasting models, such as exponential smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving averages, have expanded to contain multiple possible forms and forecasting proles. We question the complexity of forecasting and the need to consider such large families of models. Our argument is that parsimoniously identifying suitable subsets of models will not decrease forecasting accuracy, nor will they reduce the ability to estimate forecast uncertainty. We propose a framework that balances forecasting performance versus computational cost. As a result, we consider a reduced set of models. We empirically demonstrate that such a reduced set performs well. Finally, we translate computational benefits to monetary cost savings and environmental impact and discuss the implications of our results in the context of large retailers.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),88.46153846153847,10.1080/01605682.2024.2421339,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ba3834f38fe6d555fc33faad0c822c31b9558f0,Goal 12,0.01217096743266358,False,

Under the aegis of nudges, we conducted two randomized longitudinal experiments on how long people consumed a choice that was incentivized vis-à-vis a decoy effect, default effect, and compromise effect. We found that these nudges influenced choosing and consuming in opposite directions: Participants were more likely to choose the nudged option; however, they consumed it less compared to participants who chose an identical non-nudged option.

However, little research has examined people's emotional reactions to mistakes that happen more than once. In seven preregistered studies, we assessed wrongdoers' and victims' emotions that arise after one transgression and again after another. Following two (or more) consecutive transgressions, wrongdoers felt guiltier, and victims felt angrier.

The one-away effect: The pursuit of mere completionJournal of Consumer Research,"Ruan, B. & Polman, E. & Tanner, R",2024,,"A series of controlled studies found that consumers counter-normatively prefer something nearly complete over something complete. We call this phenomenon the “one-away effect” because we find that when consumers are, for example, one stamp away from completing a punch card loyalty program, they value the card more than a completed card. This is because their valuation of the one-away card is influenced by their anticipation of merely completing the card, which generates its own utility, apart from the card’s end-reward (a free coffee). To wit, the prospective utility of performing the final action that fulfills completion increases consumers’ valuation of the one-away card. Our findings suggest that consumers are motivated to complete goals, tasks, and sets not only to obtain their end-rewards, but also because merely completing things is intrinsically motivating and can be a goal in and of itself.

The Distributional Impact of Fatigue on PerformanceManagement Science,"Bavafa, H. & Jónasson, J",2024,,"Little is known about how people-centric factors affect the shape of service time distributions despite distributional statistics (variance or quantiles) being key drivers of system performance in many service industries. We investigate the impact of one people-centric factor—worker fatigue—on the average, variance, and quantiles of service times in paramedic operations. Our analysis uses data on the performance of 368,634 paramedic teams in the London Ambulance Service over 10 years. We measure fatigue by the number of prior jobs a paramedic crew has completed during a shift and estimate its impact on the time it takes the crew to respond to incidents and bring patients to hospitals. Using a recentered influence function regression approach with multiple fixed effects, we find that the average time to hospital increases by 5% throughout the course of an average shift. In addition, the workers become less consistent with fatigue; service time variance increases by 39% during a normal shift. Furthermore, we find that in addition to an upward shift in mean service times, both the upper and lower tails of the distribution have more weight for fatigued paramedics. These effects are driven mostly by the performance of paramedics at the scene, rather than their driving to or from the incident. The distributional effects of fatigue are only slightly mitigated by increased experience or reduced system workload. Our work demonstrates that the impact of people-centric factors can be highly nonuniform across the service time distribution.

The Challenge of Maintaining Passion for Work over Time: A Daily Perspective on Passion and Emotional ExhaustionOrganization Science,"Bredehorst, J. & Krautter, K. & Meuris, J. & Jachimowicz, J",2024,,"Passion for work is highly coveted, but many employees report struggling to maintain their passion over time. In the current research, we explain the challenge of pursuing passion by conceptualizing passion as an attribute with temporal variation. Viewed through a daily lens, we argue that self-regulation plays a critical role in understanding the challenges underlying the daily maintenance of passion. More specifically, we hypothesize that—unless employees adequately regulate their passion on any given day—higher levels of passion will lead them to invest more time and energy into their work, decreasing their psychological detachment from work after the workday, and consequently resulting in higher levels of emotional exhaustion the next day. Higher levels of emotional exhaustion on a given day subsequently prompt a greater need for recovery, shifting employees’ focus away from devoting time and energy into work, thereby eroding their passion on the following day. Two daily-diary studies covering 30 and 10 consecutive working days provided support for our predictions (N total = 798; k total = 15,702). Employees who felt more in charge of their passion on any given day engaged in self-regulation during their workday, increasing their psychological detachment from work and subsequently being less likely to suffer the detrimental consequences of higher daily passion. Our theory and findings demonstrate the daily interplay between passion and emotional exhaustion and specify why passion may be self-limiting unless employees adequately manage it, reflecting a challenge they need to navigate each day in pursuing their passion.

A hidden barrier to diversification? Performance recognition penalties for incumbent workers in male-dominated occupationsAmerican Sociological Review,"Meuris, J. & Merluzzi, J",2024,,"Responding to persistent gender inequity, organizations have adopted diversity initiatives to promote women’s representation in traditionally male-dominated occupations. Although studies have identified challenges to these initiatives for women entering occupations, we uncover a performance recognition penalty for incumbent workers originating from the process of occupational diversification. As women incrementally enter a male-dominated occupation, a conflict arises between the changing gender composition at the work-unit level and the masculine “ideal worker” prototype embedded in the occupation. We propose that this conflict will lower the performance expectations of the work unit, decreasing the individual likelihood of performance recognition for each worker in the unit. Using detailed panel data on police officers, we found that an officer’s individual likelihood of being nominated for a performance award consistently declined when their police unit proportionately increased in women officers. Both men and women managers enacted this penalty, with men managers penalizing men subordinates more than women subordinates. This pattern remained for awards recognizing exceptional performance, regardless of gender-typing of the unit or its work tasks, and considering officer tenure and attrition from the unit.

The present research advances the current understanding by incorporating viewers’ need for self-identity into their response model. Six studies, including an analysis of field data (14,725 Instagram photos by a top travel influencer) and five controlled experiments, find that the presence (vs. absence) of another human in the photo of an identity-relevant experience (e.g., a vacation, a wedding) can lower viewers' liking and preference for the venue (i.e., the vacation destination, the wedding venue) in the photo. This effect is mediated by viewers' feelings of others' ownership of the venue and moderated by the relevance of the experience to the viewer’s self-identity as well as the distinctiveness of the human in the photo.

Increasing Hotel Loyalty Through Psychological OwnershipCornell Hospitality Quarterly,"Yoon, R. & Peck, J. & Shu, S",2024,,"The hospitality industry has long emphasized guest satisfaction as key to building loyalty. However, in such a highly competitive and service-oriented market, interventions to increase satisfaction may often be too costly relative to their marginal impact on guest loyalty. This research proposes a new and potentially lower-cost avenue for increasing guest loyalty to the hotel: guests’ sense of ownership of their hotel rooms. An analysis of 14,689 online reviews on TripAdvisor, a naturalistic field experiment in a hotel ( N = 82), as well as two controlled lab simulation studies (combined N = 1,002) jointly demonstrate that increasing psychological ownership of a hotel room significantly increases guest loyalty to the hotel, independent of customer satisfaction. This work extends our current understanding of psychological ownership and customer loyalty by demonstrating how psychological ownership of a tangible service element can enhance brand loyalty via a mechanism that does not rely on changes in satisfaction. In doing so, we highlight the role of psychological ownership as an underexplored and cost-efficient driver of loyalty in hospitality settings.",Crossref,90.19607843137254,10.1177/19389655241309634,https://doi.org/10.1177/19389655241309634,Goal 17,0.004372809149469001,False,
Admission control bias and path-dependent feedback under diagnosis uncertaintyManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Kim, S. & Tong, J",2024,,"Problem definition: Do physicians exhibit predictable behavioral bias when making admission control decisions under patient diagnosis uncertainty with stochastic arrivals and lengths of stay? How can we structure feedback to help improve their decision making? Methodology/results: We use a behavioral model to theorize how a diagnosis anchoring and insufficient adjustment heuristic may lead to an over-rationing bias, and we hypothesize when this bias is greatest. We then propose that feedback for rejected patients—above and beyond feedback for admitted patients—is critical for mitigating this bias. This is because feedback for only admitted patients may suffer from a type of path dependency that prevents decision makers from receiving the most helpful disconfirming feedback. We provide evidence supporting these hypotheses using preregistered experiments in which medical students, Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, or Prolific workers manage admissions for simulated hospital units. Managerial implications: Our results (1) illuminate an important anchoring bias in admission control under diagnosis uncertainty, (2) identify rejected-patient feedback as a critical component for mitigating this bias, and (3) provide insight into the circumstances under which these phenomena are likely to be most significant.

It’s a matter of style: The role of audit firms and audit partners in key audit matter reportingContemporary Accounting Research,"Rousseau, L. & Zehms, K",2024,,"Abstract We examine the relative importance of audit firm versus partner decision styles in key audit matter (KAM) reporting. Standard setters intended KAMs to increase the usefulness of the audit report by requiring the partner‐led engagement team to disclose engagement‐specific information about the most significant judgments they made during the audit. However, stakeholders expressed widespread concern that audit firms' longstanding efforts toward standardization would result in generic KAMs at the audit firm level and provide partners little opportunity or incentive for engagement‐specific reporting. We evaluate this high‐stakes tension between standard setters' goals for audit reporting and auditors' deep‐rooted practices by leveraging data from the United Kingdom, which has required partner identification since 2009 and expanded audit reports since 2013. We find that clients sharing the same partner receive KAMs that are 10% more textually similar than clients with different partners. In contrast, clients sharing the same audit firm receive KAMs that are just 2% more textually similar than clients with different audit firms. This implies that partner decision styles are more important in influencing KAM outcomes than audit firm styles. Collectively, our results suggest that partners make unique KAM reporting judgments, countering concerns that audit firms' efforts toward standardization will yield boilerplate KAMs. This evidence extends the literature on expanded audit reporting and partner decision styles and provides valuable insights into a contemporary issue in audit regulation with broader implications for understanding dynamics within the profession.",Crossref,88.7218045112782,10.1111/1911-3846.12902,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12902,Goal 5,0.009655593574589075,False,
Wheels to meals: Measuring the impact of micromobility on restaurant demandJournal of Marketing Research,"Kim, K. & McCarthy, D",2024,,"Dockless shared micromobility services have grown substantially in recent years, but their impact on consumer demand has remained largely unstudied. The authors estimate how the largest and fastest-growing segment of this market—the dockless electric scooter (“e-scooter”) sharing industry—impacts spending in one of the largest segments of the local economy, the restaurant industry. Using data covering 391 companies in 98 U.S. cities, the authors find that the introduction of e-scooters in a city significantly impacts restaurant spending, increasing spending by approximately 5.2% for e-scooter users, driving incremental spending of at least $11.3 million annually across all cities that first allowed e-scooters to operate over summer 2018.

Cash is king? Understanding financing risk in housing marketsReview of Finance,"Han, L. & Hong, S",2024,,"Abstract In Los Angeles, all-cash home purchases quintupled during the last decade. Compared with an else-equal mortgage offer, a cash offer is associated with 29 percent shorter time-to-close and a 2–3.9 percent price discount, indicating a substantial amount of financing risk—the risk to a seller that a transaction may not close on time and may fail to occur again because a mortgage contingency fails. The estimated cash discount aligns well with a canonical model calibrated to the sample market. Our findings reveal that closing risk alone is insufficient to explain the cash discount. Rather, it turns on the possibility that a property back on the market may fail to sell, requiring a substantial risk compensation. The estimated cash discount is smaller during booms and in larger markets, highlighting the inseparability of financial frictions in the mortgage market and search frictions in the housing market.",Crossref,92.98245614035088,10.1093/rof/rfae025,https://doi.org/10.1093/rof/rfae025,Goal 8,0.01240731625858841,False,

Assessing Oral Health in US Children and Its Impact on Disparities of Overall Health and Health Expenditures: An Application Using Two-Stage ClusteringNorth American Actuarial Journal,"Rosenberg, M. & Yun, S. & Kim, K",2024,,"We assess children’s oral and overall health using an innovative clustering methodology. Prior studies have documented the link between oral health and overall health, such as dental caries, which could lead to infections and pain, or periodontal disease, which is associated with other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Using the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Study data, we link children’s dental care services and other control variables with various health outcomes using a two-stage clustering method. In the first stage, we cluster similar children using their social determinants of health, medical conditions, and dental care utilization as input variables. In the second stage, we identify groups of similar clusters using a metric called cosine similarity. External variables, rather than those used to create the clusters, are used to assess the effectiveness of the clusters. An outcome score is created based on children’s favorable overall and mental health statuses and absence of behavioral issues at home, school, and in general. We find that the first-stage clusters are separated into three main groups in the second stage, where one cluster from the first stage is very different from all of the other clusters, a second group has more favorable outcome scores, and the third group has lower outcome scores. Lower dental expenditures are associated with lower outcome scores. Clusters are useful for cost management purposes to identify subgroups for interventions to improve population health. Comparisons of access and outcomes of children between different insurance types can provide beneficial information for insurance design and public policy. Our approach can be applied to other areas of practice where there is an interest in grouping similar individuals and relating these groups to other quantities. The two-stage clustering method is a versatile method with a broader appeal to empirical research, especially when there are big data, a large number of clusters, and many input variables.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),93.7007874015748,10.1080/10920277.2023.2291042,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b59811106753e68dcc0d0abb74d17f093e7e540a,Goal 3,0.1188196752712973,True,mental health
Strategic Restraint: When do Human-Capital-Intensive Companies Choose (Not) to Use Noncompete Agreements?Strategic Management Journal,"Ganco, M. & Liu, J. & Wang, H. & Yamaguchi, S",2024,,"Abstract Research Summary Extant work in strategic management has focused on the role of noncompete agreements (NCAs)—a form of restrictive legal lever used by firms when managing human capital—and conceptualized them as being advantageous to firms. Challenging this notion, we highlight a novel downside of using NCAs and show how their use by some firms creates differentiation opportunities for rival firms. We analyze a unique survey dataset to examine the heterogeneity in the firms' actual use of NCAs conditional on industry and state. We find that the nonuse of NCAs is more common among firms that rely more heavily on talent and are also not the industry leaders, and such firms are more likely not to use NCAs with the goal of attracting skilled employees. Managerial Summary Noncompete agreements (NCAs) have long been regarded as effective tools for firms managing human capital. Our research challenges this conventional wisdom. We show that NCAs are not uniformly beneficial to all firms even when looking at competitors within the same industry. By analyzing a unique survey dataset, we find that firms relying heavily on talent and not leading their industries are more inclined to forgo NCAs. Their strategic intent? Attracting skilled employees. This study sheds light on the delicate balance between legal constraints and talent attraction and is particularly salient in the context of the policy efforts to ban NCAs.",Crossref,78.99159663865547,10.1002/smj.3648,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3648,Goal 16,0.011820253741388,False,
The Influence of Corporate Social Responsibility on Stakeholders in Different Business ContextsJournal of Service Research,"Ghanbarpour, T. & Crosby, L. & Johnson, M. & Gustafsson, A",2024,,"The authors explore two important topics related to this special issue. One is how corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities impacts stakeholders, more specifically customers and shareholders/investors. Second is understanding customer recognition and demand for CSR activities. Insight into these topics is gained through the study of contextual differences in this value creation. Previous studies suggest that two important contextual differences have the potential to impact CSR-based value creation, the product versus service nature of the firm and whether the firm operates primarily in a business-to-business (B2B) versus business-to-consumer (B2C) channel. The lower innovative capabilities of service firms and the relative intangibility of services should hamper the impact of CSR activities in service versus product contexts. The impact should be higher, however, in a B2B versus B2C context based on the need for greater organizational alignment, adaptation, and relationship-specific investments. Results from a large-scale secondary dataset reinforce prior findings that CSR activities influence firm value through customer satisfaction. Moreover, the results reveal that this effect is weaker for service (vs. product) firms and stronger for B2B (vs. B2C) firms.

While data security threats may increase when hospitals join HIEs to share data across organizational boundaries, HIEs institute “secure exchange” and promote security practices among participants. Due to these countervailing effects, it is unclear how joining an HIE affects hospitals’ data breach risk. This study seeks to understand the security implications of HIEs from the lens of governance and coordination. We compiled a panel dataset of more than 3,000 hospitals over six years. By leveraging different identification strategies, including difference-in-differences design, matching, and instrumental variables, we found that the likelihood of a hospital experiencing a data breach decreased by more than 35.37 % after joining an HIE.

In this study, we exploit Facebook’s Social Connectedness Index, which reflects social connections across the United States, and we investigate the role of social connectedness in political decision-making among individuals who are located across distant geographical regions. Our results suggest that social connectedness between counties has a homogenizing effect on voting for the same presidential candidate, either Democratic or Republican.

We Fly Congress: Market Actions as Corporate Political Activity in the U,"Pang, M. & Funk, R. & Hirschman, D",2024,,"The literature on corporate political activity (CPA) generally views nonmarket actions aimed at influencing political actors (e.g., lobbying or campaign contributions) as related but separate activities from market actions. This study demonstrates how firms’ core market actions (e.g., market entry or geographic expansion) can function as CPA. We theorize two mechanisms through which firms leverage market actions as CPA: “pork” (i.e., ones that primarily benefit a politician’s constituents) and “perk” (i.e., ones that directly benefit the politician). We document these mechanisms through an empirical analysis of data from the U.S. airline industry in 1990–2019. Specifically, we find that airlines increase the supply of flights from the airports in the home district of the chair of the Transportation Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives (pork). We also find that the airlines increase the supply of nonstop flights to Washington, DC. from the Chair’s district (perk). We use counterfactual estimation methods and exogenous turnovers in committee leadership to provide causal evidence. Moreover, the observed increase in flight supplies is negatively associated with formal policy changes in Congress, and with text mining techniques, we find that this effect is stronger for bills related to aviation safety and security. We contribute to the literature on CPA by demonstrating a blurred boundary between market and nonmarket actions, which helps explain firms’ competitive actions that cannot be explained by market considerations alone.

Over-the-counter medicines present a unique consumption context because consumers are expected to follow product label instructions. For acetaminophen, a widely consumed over-the-counter drug, the authors study which consumers tend to deviate from the label instructions, why they do so, and the interventions that are most promising to mitigate such deviations. They develop a dynamic structural model of consumption that enables them to investigate the probability of different types of label deviations (e.g., >4 g per day) and drivers of such behaviors. Label deviations are infrequent “tail area” behaviors, and the model uncovers them well. The analysis is based on a unique online consumption diary in which consumers select from two classes of acetaminophen products (single ingredient or a combination of ingredients) to treat their pain or non-pain-related symptoms . Consumers have a higher probability of taking >4 g of acetaminophen when they have multiple symptoms, and a variety of observable factors explain the individual propensity to deviate from the label.

The excess and deficit patronization measures employ widely available customer feedback data and can be used by managers to identify at-risk customers and those unlikely to defect. We argue that a customer’s satisfaction provides a baseline level of patronization intentions and that excess patronization intentions—intentions greater than those that can be explained by a customer’s satisfaction with a firm’s offerings (i.e., the residuals in a model that regresses patronization intentions on satisfaction)—are generated in part by the presence of customer-level switching costs. Conversely, any deficit patronization intentions are generated in part by a customer’s variety seeking. Using data from the financial services industry, we find that these residuals serve as indicators of the presence and extent of customer-level switching cost and variety seeking. In addition to providing measures of interesting and under-researched phenomena, this suggests that the measures may serve as proxies to test existing theories concerning switching costs and variety seeking in situations where measurement and data availability have previously limited such research.",Crossref,93.16770186335404,10.1177/10946705241247172,https://doi.org/10.1177/10946705241247172,Goal 9,0.01266814193758285,False,

A copula model for marked point process with a terminal event: an application in dynamic prediction of insurance claimsAnnals of Applied Statistics,"Yang, L. & Shi, P. & Huang, S",2024,,"Accurate prediction of an insurer’s outstanding liabilities is crucial for maintaining the financial health of the insurance sector. We aim to develop a statistical model for insurers to dynamically forecast unpaid losses by leveraging the granular transaction data on individual claims. The liability cash flow from a single insurance claim is determined by an event process that describes the recurrences of payments, a payment process that generates a sequence of payment amounts, and a settlement process that terminates both the event and payment processes. More importantly, the three components are dependent on one another, which enables the dynamic prediction of an insurer’s outstanding liability. We introduce a copula-based point process framework to model the recurrent events of payment transactions from an insurance claim, where the longitudinal payment amounts and the time-to-settlement outcome are formulated as the marks and the terminal event of the counting process, respectively. The dependencies among the three components are characterized using the method of pair copula constructions. We further develop a stagewise strategy for parameter estimation and illustrate its desirable properties with numerical experiments.

Enhanced pricing and management of bundled insurance risks with dependence-aware prediction using pair copula constructionJournal of Econometrics,"Shi, P. & Zhao, Z",2024,,"We propose a dependence-aware predictive modeling framework for multivariate risks stemmed from an insurance contract with bundling features — an important type of policy increasingly offered by major insurance companies. The bundling feature naturally leads to longitudinal measurements of multiple insurance risks, and correct pricing and management of such risks is of fundamental interest to financial stability of the macroeconomy. We build a novel predictive model that fully captures the dependence among the multivariate repeated risk measurements. Specifically, the longitudinal measurement of each individual risk is first modeled using pair copula construction with a D-vine structure, and the multiple D-vines are then integrated by a flexible copula. While our analysis mainly focuses on multivariate insurance risks, the proposed model indeed contributes to the broad research area of longitudinal data analysis. In particular, it provides a unified modeling framework for multivariate longitudinal data that can accommodate different scales of measurements, including continuous, discrete, and mixed observations, and thus can be potentially useful for various economic studies. A computationally efficient sequential method is proposed for model estimation and inference, and its performance is investigated both theoretically and via simulation studies. In the application, we examine multivariate bundled risks in multi-peril property insurance using proprietary data from a commercial property insurance provider. The proposed model is found to provide improved decision making for several key insurance operations. For underwriting, we show that the experience rate priced by the proposed model leads to a 9% lift in the insurer’s net revenue. For reinsurance, we show that the insurer underestimates the risk of the retained insurance portfolio by 10% when ignoring the dependence among bundled insurance risks.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),94.37229437229438,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624000228,Goal 17,0.01360270809655252,False,
Leveraging weather dynamics in insurance claims triage using deep learningJournal of the American Statistical Association,"Shi, P. & Zhang, W. & Shi, K",2024,,"In property insurance claims triage, insurers often use static information to assess the severity of a claim and to identify the subsequent actions. We hypothesize that the pattern of weather conditions throughout the course of a loss event is predictive of the insured losses, and hence appropriate use of weather dynamics improves the operation of insurers’ claim management. To test this hypothesis, we propose a deep learning method to incorporate dynamic weather information in the predictive modeling of the insured losses for reported claims. The proposed method features a hierarchical network architecture to address the challenges in claims triage due to the nature of weather dynamics. In the empirical analysis, we examine a portfolio of hail damage property insurance claims obtained from a major U.S. insurance carrier. When supplemented by dynamic weather information, the deep learning method exhibits substantial improvement in the hold-out predictive performance.

The authors address this gap in a study of taste preferences, important drivers of food and beverage consumption. Using a large U.K.-based sample, they find that with sample sizes currently available, genetic data are expected to significantly improve prediction of taste preferences above traditionally used metrics such as demographics, behavioral variables, and even past consumption, especially for tastes that are uncommon in the local diet (e.g., spicy, sour), as they are less expressed behaviorally.

Roles of Feedback and Phishing Characteristics in Antiphishing Training Performance: Perspectives of Goal-Setting and Skill AcquisitionJournal of the Association for Information Systems,"Pan, S. & Kwak, D. & Kuem, J. & Kim, S",2024,,"Because phishing attacks often exploit individuals’ inexperience in detecting them, it is important for managers to provide workers with proper feedback on their reactions to phishing scams.

The objectives of this study are to identify (1) the determinants of decision avoidance and detection accuracy, (2) the contextual effect of type of feedback in antiphishing training, (3) the impacts of perceived detection efficacy on training outcomes, and (4) the interaction effects between feedback characteristics and perceived detection efficacy/phishing characteristics on training outcomes. Drawing upon goal-setting theory, skill acquisition theory, and antiphishing training literature, our model provides a theoretical account of how feedback characteristics (e.g., type, quantity), phishing characteristics (e.g., phishing cue saliency), and perceived detection efficacy affect antiphishing training outcomes (e.g., decision avoidance and detection accuracy). To empirically test the model, we performed four experiments with 652 subjects in the United States from three different online panels via Amazon Mechanical Turk, Esearch.com, and Clickworker.com.

Can Words Speak Louder than Actions? Using Top Management Teams’ Language to Predict Myopic Marketing SpendingJournal of Marketing,"Martin, A. & Kushwaha, T",2024,,"Myopic marketing spending—curtailing marketing and research and development expenses to boost earnings—damages firms’ long-term value. Despite this, top management teams are often myopic, and by the time investors or boards detect such short-termism, it is too late to react or intervene. This research introduces a novel prediction method by analyzing the language top management teams use in earnings calls, specifically focusing on marketing and earnings emphasis, to predict future instances of myopic marketing spending. Through linguistic dependency parsing of almost 11 million sentences extracted from nearly 25,000 quarterly earnings call transcripts of 1,197 firms between 2008 and 2019, the authors demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict myopic marketing spending at a quarterly frequency for up to one year in advance. They find that an increase of one standard deviation in earnings emphasis is associated with a 23.68% increase in the likelihood of future myopic marketing spending. Investments based on the proposed approach produce 1.61% additional annual abnormal returns compared with models that exclusively use known predictors of myopic marketing spending, while offering earlier foresight and more frequent opportunities for intervention.

Assuring the Crowd: The Role of Assurance in Securities Crowdfunding SuccessManagement Science,"Burke, Q. & Wangerin, D. & Warfield, T",2024,,"This paper examines the role of CPA financial statement assurance in securities crowdfunding. Under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding, effective May 2016, early-stage private companies are permitted to conduct securities crowdfunding offerings—low-dollar securities offerings on Internet platforms—to a large number of investors. Using SEC filings and hand-collected data on the universe of offerings from 2016 to 2019, we examine the relation between CPA assurance and capital raised in the securities crowdfunding market. We fail to find evidence that issuers voluntarily seek higher levels of assurance, and we document high rates of noncompliance with the CPA assurance requirements. Our results suggest the on average positive association between CPA assurance and crowdfunding outcomes shown in prior research is explained by noncompliance with the Reg CF assurance requirements and is not driven by additional assurance. Overall, this study provides new insights of interest to crowdfunding issuers, investors, and regulators on the role of assurance in this nascent market of capital formation for startups.

Can Standard Setters Improve Cash Flow Reporting of Capital Expenditures?Accounting Horizons,"Liang, C. & Linsmeier, T",2024,,"SYNOPSIS We evaluate whether current capital expenditures (capex) reporting in the cash flows statement can be improved via disaggregation and/or reclassification of some capex as operating activities. FASB Concept Statement No. 5 suggests recurrence and risk as useful characteristics for determining disaggregation and classification in financial statements. Using a novel German dataset that provides disaggregated capex information, we examine whether these characteristics differ across capex components and provide evidence of up to five economically distinct components. These results support disaggregating capex into maintenance, expansion, rationalization, restructuring, and environmental components. Our findings, however, do not support reclassifying any capex component as operating activities, although evidence suggests capex and capex components are misclassified as investing activities. As a first step toward improving capex reporting guidance, our evidence suggests standard setters consider disaggregating and presenting capex components as supplemental information in the cash flow statement, the footnotes, or MD&A.

The Choice Overload Effect in Online Recommender SystemsManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Long, X. & Sun, J. & Dai, H. & Zhang, D",2024,,"Problem definition: Online retailing platforms are increasingly relying on personalized recommender systems to help guide consumer choice. An important but understudied question in such settings is how many products to include in a recommendation set. In this work, we study how the number of recommended products influences consumers’ search and purchase behavior in an online personalized recommender system within a retargeting setting. Methodology/results: Via a field experiment involving 1.6 million consumers on an online retailing platform, we causally demonstrate that consumers’ likelihood of purchasing any product from the recommendation set first increases then decreases as the number of recommended products increases. Importantly, as much as 64% of the decrease in purchase probability (i.e., the choice overload effect) can be attributed to a decrease in consumers’ likelihood of starting a search (i.e., clicking on any recommended product). We discuss the possible behavioral mechanisms driving these results and analyze how these effects could be heterogeneous across different product categories, price ranges, and timing. Managerial implications: This work presents real-world experimental evidence for the choice overload effect in online retailing platforms, highlights the important role of consumer search behavior in driving this effect, and sheds light on when and how limiting the number of options in a recommender system may be beneficial to online retailers.

Newsvendor competition with endogenous biasesProduction and Operations Management,"Long, X. & Wu, Y",2024,,"<?show [AQ ID=GQ2 POS=-20pt]?><?show [AQ ID=GQ5 POS=12pt]?>Extensive studies have revealed that newsvendor decisions by human decision-makers are often biased by cognitive limitations, and, therefore, fail to achieve optimal profits prescribed by normative models. These biases are typically considered as liabilities in individual inventory decision-making, and much research has focused on developing methods to debias the decision-maker—for example, by providing decision support tools. However, in competitive settings biases can provide a competitive advantage, such that a biased newsvendor may earn a higher profit than an unbiased one. This raises the question of whether and when firms should debias their decision-makers. In this paper, we analyze decision biases that are endogenous rather than exogenous in competing newsvendor games. Specifically, we develop a two-stage game-theoretic model in which competing firms first select their decision-makers typefied by their bias levels, and then engage in a classic inventory competition game. Our analysis confirms the positive effect of the decision-maker’s bias on a firm’s economic outcome. However, this effect only appears in competitions in which decision biases are exogenously given. When biases are endogenously selected, firms are always (weakly) worse off than if they all had rational decision-makers. Our results suggest that debiasing at the industry level (e.g., adopting advanced inventory planning software) could benefit all players; however, individual firms do not have the incentive to do so in the absence of coordination mechanisms.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.56626506024097,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10591478241252157,Goal 5,0.02216468026406353,False,
Waste not want not? The environmental implications of quick response and upcyclingManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Long, X. & Gui, L",2024,,"Problem definition: Overproduction is often cited as the fashion industry’s biggest environmental issue, as textile production is notoriously resource intensive and pollutive, and much of the textile produced may end up as “deadstock” fabric or finished goods that do not sell. In this paper, we study two major approaches to address this issue: quick response, whereby finished goods inventory is replenished on demand, and upcycling, whereby deadstock fabric is reused to make new clothes. Proponents of these strategies typically focus on their positive environmental impact in downstream supply chain stages (e.g., finished goods production and waste disposal). Less is known, however, about their impact on upstream activities such as raw material acquisition, which we investigate in this work. Methodology/results: We analyze the effect of quick response and upcycling options on firms’ fabric acquisition and production decisions, as well as firms’ incentives to adopt these strategies. We then assess these strategies’ environmental impact in a life cycle framework. Our results show that quick response—when implemented in isolation—reduces deadstock of finished goods, but could increase the amount of fabric acquired. This not only results in more total deadstock (in both finished goods and fabric form), but also aggravates the environmental burden associated with fabric production in the upstream of the fashion supply chain, and could lead to a worse overall environmental impact for the industry. Upcycling together with quick response could alleviate total deadstock generation, but further increases the firm’s demand for fabric. We analyze the effectiveness of two types of policies—subsidizing quick response/upcycling and banning deadstock destruction—in reducing deadstock and curbing firms’ need for fabric. Managerial implications: Our work highlights a tradeoff between downstream deadstock reduction and upstream fabric acquisition, and suggests that regional policies that aim to reduce local deadstock could often have adverse global impacts.

“Run Forrest Run!”: Measuring the Impact of App-Enabled Performance and Social Feedback on Athletic and Usage OutcomesProduction and Operations Management,"Babar, Y. & Chan, J. & Choi, B",2024,,"Exercise-tracking apps are digital tools for delivering personalized behavioral interventions. Despite the growing usage of exercise applications, the efficacy of in-exercise app features in driving usage and athletic outcomes remains poorly understood. To remain competitive, sports organizations now need to leverage tracking tools to efficiently allocate resources and streamline training regimens and interventions for their core assets (i.e., athletes). In response to these operational needs, we examine two specific forms of such in-exercise interventions, namely performance feedback and social feedback. We conducted an 18-month-long field study with 1,037 uniformed group servicemen to assess the effect of these feedback types on running and usage outcomes. Results from the field study provided evidence that these two app features improved the servicemen’s running times and frequency of application usage, on average. Contrary to the common belief that more features are better, the joint usage of two feedback features does not produce additive effects. Tests at more granular levels suggest that users who received both feedback types in exercise episodes exhibit overconfidence behavior by participating in fewer subsequent exercises. The receipt of both feedback may be redundant and can cause user annoyance. Heterogeneity tests revealed that while performance feedback benefited most runners, social features were effective only for already stronger runners. Also, only positive social feedback had a significant impact on running performance. The results further indicate that performance feedback generated a slow but sustained increase in usage frequency, while social feedback spurred quick initial growth in usage but dwindled in effectiveness over time.

Unintended Consequences of Advances in Matching Technologies: Information Revelation and Strategic Participation on Gig-Economy PlatformsManagement Science,"Liu, Y. & Lou, B. & Zhao, X. & Li, X",2024,,"Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in matching technologies used to improve the matching between workers and employers requesting job tasks on a gig-economy platform. Although conventional wisdom suggests that technologies with higher matching quality benefit the platform by assigning better-matched jobs to workers, we discover a possible unintended revenue-decreasing effect. Our stylized game-theoretic model suggests that, although a technology’s matching enhancement effect can increase a platform’s revenue, the jobs assigned by the better matching technology can also unintentionally reveal more information about uncertain labor demand to workers, especially when demand is low, and thus unfavorably change workers’ participation decisions, resulting in a revenue loss for the platform. We extend our model to cases in which (1) the share of revenue between workers and platform is endogenous, (2) the matching quality can be improved continuously, (3) the opportunity cost of workers is affected by competition between platforms, and (4) workers compete for job tasks. We find consistent results with additional insights, including the optimal matching quality that a platform should pursue. Furthermore, we examine two approaches to mitigate the potential negative effect of using an advanced matching technology for the platform and find that under certain conditions, the platform can benefit from revealing labor demand or competition information directly to workers. Our results shed light on both the intended positive and unintended negative effects of improvements in matching quality and highlight the importance of thoughtful development, management, and application of matching technologies in the gig economy.

The mutual constitution of culture and psyche: The bidirectional relationship between individuals’ perceived control and cultural tightness–looseness,"Ma, A. & Savani, K. & Liu, F. & Tai, K. & Kay, A",2023,,"According to the theory of mutual constitution of culture and psyche, just as culture shapes people, individuals' psychological states can influence culture. We build on compensatory control theory, which suggests that low personal control can lead people to prefer societal systems that impose order, to examine the mutual constitution of personal control and cultural tightness. Specifically, we tested whether individuals' lack of personal control increases their preference for tighter cultures as a means of restoring order and predictability, and whether tighter cultures in turn reduce people's feelings of personal control. Seven studies (five preregistered) with participants from the United States, Singapore, and China examine this cycle of mutual constitution. Specifically, documenting the correlational link between person and culture, we found that Americans lower on personal control preferred to live in tighter states (Study 1). Chinese employees lower on personal control also desired more structure and preferred a tighter organizational culture (Study 2). Employing an experimental causal chain design, Studies 3-5 provided causal evidence for our claim that lack of control increases desire for tighter cultures via the need for structure. Finally, tracing the link back from culture to person, Studies 6a and 6b found that whereas tighter cultures decreased perceptions of individual personal control, they increased people's sense of collective control.

In key U.S. swing states (Study 3a), and a nationally representative sample (Study 3b), residents with a more growth mindset were more willing to support ballot propositions increasing the minimum wage and other compensation. Study 4 provided causal evidence. The next two studies confirmed the specificity of the predictor. People's beliefs about the malleability of intelligence, but not personality (Study 5a) or effort (Study 5b), predicted their support for increasing low-wage workers' compensation. Study 6 examined multiple potential mechanisms, including empathy, attributions for poverty, and environmental affordances. The relationship between growth mindset and support for raising low-wage workers' wages was explained by more situational rather than dispositional attributions for poverty. Finally, Studies 7a and 7b replicated the effect of growth mindset on support for increasing low-wage workers' compensation and provided confirmatory evidence for the mediator-situational, rather than dispositional, attributions of poverty. These findings suggest that growth mindsets about intelligence promote support for increasing low-wage workers' wages; we discuss the theoretical and practical implications.

Designing rewards-based crowdfunding campaigns for strategic (but distracted) contributorsNaval Research Logistics,"Chakraborty, S. & Ma, A. & Swinney, R",2023,,"Abstract In rewards‐based crowdfunding, entrepreneurs solicit donations from a large number of individual contributors. If total donations exceed a prespecified funding target, the entrepreneur distributes nonmonetary rewards to contributors; otherwise, their donations are refunded. We study how to design such campaigns when contributors choose not just whether to contribute, but also when to contribute. We show that strategic contribution behavior—when contributors intentionally delay until campaign success is likely—can arise from the combination of nonrefundable (potentially very small) hassle costs and the risk of campaign failure, and can explain pledging patterns commonly observed in crowdfunding. Furthermore, such delays do not hurt the entrepreneur if contributors are perfectly rational, but they do if contributors are distracted , that is, if they might fail to return to the campaign after an intentional delay. To mitigate this, we find that an entrepreneur can use a simple menu of rewards with a fixed number of units sold at a low price, and an unlimited number sold at a higher price; this segments contributors over time based on the information they observe upon arrival. We show that, despite its simplicity, such a menu performs well compared to a theoretically optimal menu consisting of an infinite number of different rewards and price levels under many conditions.",Crossref,87.25490196078431,10.1002/nav.22081,https://doi.org/10.1002/nav.22081,Goal 13,0.004372946024390883,False,

"Consumer Tax Credits for EVs: Some Quasi-Experimental Evidence on Consumer Demand, Product Substitution, and Carbon EmissionsManagement Science","He, C. & Ozturk, O. & Gu, C. & Chintagunta, P",2023,,"Governments worldwide have spent billions of dollars on monetary incentives for consumers to encourage the adoption of eco-friendly (“green”) products. However, there is little consensus on the effectiveness of delayed monetary incentives with complex structures, such as tax credits in increasing green product adoption and reducing carbon emissions. The literature is also limited on the mechanisms through which monetary incentives work in general. We address these issues by studying the impact of tax credit incentives on green and nongreen vehicle sales in the U.S. auto industry. A tax credit incentive could boost green vehicle sales through cost savings on the vehicle’s price. However, the incentive may prove ineffective because of important barriers to adoption (e.g., long charging times for electric cars). To measure the sales and emissions impacts of tax credits, we study incentive changes in South Carolina and Oregon via various quasi-experimental approaches and assess the generalizability of our key findings to Colorado. Unlike recent studies showing an insignificant or negative correlation between tax credits and electric vehicle adoption, our analyses show that unit sales of incentivized plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) increase by an average of 3.7% (up to 52.7% in some counties) following a $2,000 incentive. In contrast, PHEV sales remain unchanged after the incentive’s termination, implying a positive net sales effect. We also explore the underlying mechanisms for the incentive’s impact by examining various purchase funnel stages. In the awareness stage, the incentive’s positive effect on PHEV demand peaks around the consumers’ tax-filing period. As for the consideration stage, our analyses of online consumer search indicate that the incentive does not expand the consumer pool considering PHEVs. In the conversion stage, the incentive generates more sales for PHEVs in counties where (i) consumers are more likely to have PHEVs in their consideration sets regardless of the incentive (i.e., Democratic counties) and (ii) consumers value cost-saving more (i.e., counties with lower middle income). Also, the heightened demand for PHEVs following the incentive stems from the substitution from gasoline vehicles with high fuel efficiency. We estimate the average cost of reducing carbon emissions through tax credits to be $109 per ton, which is less expensive than tax rebates for conventional hybrids and subsidies for residential solar panels.

A normative theory of luckFrontiers in Psychology,"Liu, C. & Tsay, C",2023,,"Psychologists have identified heuristics and biases that can cause people to make assumptions about factors that contribute to the success of individuals and firms, whose outcomes may have actually resulted primarily from randomness. Yet the interpretation of these biases becomes ambiguous when they represent reasonable cognitive shortcuts that offer certain advantages. This paper addresses this ambiguity by presenting four versions (weak, semi-weak, semi-strong, strong) of a normative theory of luck that integrates insights from psychology with the chance model approach to predict the circumstances under which performance non-monotonicity occurs: higher performance may not only indicate greater luck, but also lower expected merit or quality. The semi-strong version is illustrated by examining the decoupling of citations of academic publications and their impact, illuminating when higher citations indicate lower quality. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of a normative theory of luck, emphasizing strategies to address situations where people mistake luck for skill.",Crossref,89.36170212765957,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1157527,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1157527,Goal 4,0.006121111476766278,False,

The Damages and Distortions from Discrimination in the Rental Housing MarketQuarterly Journal of Economics,"Christensen, P. & Timmins, C",2023,,"Abstract By constraining an individual’s choice during a search, housing discrimination distorts sorting decisions away from true preferences and results in a ceteris paribus reduction in welfare. This study combines a large-scale field experiment with a residential sorting model to derive utility-theoretic measures of renter welfare loss associated with the constraints imposed by discrimination in the rental housing market. Results from experiments conducted in five cities show that key neighborhood amenities are associated with higher levels of discrimination. Counterfactual simulations based on the sorting model suggest that discrimination imposes damages equivalent to 4.4% and 3.5% of the annual incomes for African American and Hispanic/Latinx renters, respectively. Damages are increasing in income for African American renters, such that effects become stronger for economically mobile households. Renters of color must make substantial investments in additional search to mitigate the costs of these constraints. We find that a naive model ignoring discrimination constraints yields biased estimates of willingness to pay for key neighborhood amenities.",Crossref,95.17241379310344,10.1093/qje/qjad029,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjad029,Goal 10,0.05435637130299496,True,eliminating discrimination
"Toward an Ontology of Consumers as Distributed Networks (or the End of ‘Consumer Research’ as We Know It?): Retrospective Insights from the Praxeomorphism of Russ Belk’s ‘Extended Self’,”Journal of Marketing Management","Thompson, C",2023,,"ABSTRACT Belk’s conceptualisation of the extended self is one of the most influential articles published in the history of consumer research. However, less scholarly attention has been given to the broader ontological implications of Belk’s later arguments that his original distinction between a core and extended self should be abandoned. In this comment, I first highlight how Belk’s original formulation marked a contested transition from a dualistic view of consumers as possessing a core self that remains distinct from the socio-material world to a dialectical understanding of consumer selves as emerging from a centre-to-periphery network of relations. His ensuing update implicitly denotes another ontological shift towards an even more de-centred view of the ‘extended self’. However, Belk’s reformulation of the extended self in the digital age lacked a culturally established, alternative praxeomorphic model needed to fully disentangle the extended self from the ‘heavy’ ontology of the core self. Contemporary socio-technical innovations are beginning to offer a praxeomorphic means to ontologically re-vision consumers as distributed networks whose life narratives function as ledgers of their assembled experiences. As an emerging praxeomorphic future shaped by the mass diffusion of AI technologies is rapidly taking shape, I suggest that ‘consumer research’, as we currently understand it, may soon be radically transformed.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),78.3068783068783,10.1080/0267257x.2024.2345320,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/297de45572766f1ed3ecd14872a33ef6ccd74f20,Goal 9,0.01125447827036431,False,
Why Do Retail Prices Fall During Seasonal Demand Peaks?Rand Journal of Economics,"Butters, A. & Sacks, D. & Seo, B",2023,,"ABSTRACT Examining widely‐sold products across dozens of categories in a national scanner database, we find seasonality in demand is large—20 log points for the median category, and pervasive. At seasonal frequencies, price fluctuations are typically countercyclical but small—1.5 log points on average. For most categories, we find seasonality in demand is driven by extensive margin changes in households purchasing any product in the category, and coincides with demand becoming more elastic as it peaks. These patterns suggest countercyclical pricing can be accounted for by demand‐side factors instead of requiring supply‐side explanations, or cross‐category pricing motives (e.g., “loss leader”).",Crossref,93.20388349514563,10.1111/1756-2171.12490,https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-2171.12490,Goal 12,0.00877460031326566,False,

We estimate the model using both credit market data and the evolution of individuals' credit scores. We conduct counterfactuals to assess how more or less information used in scoring individuals affects outcomes and welfare.

Demand Forecasting for Executives and Professionals,"Kolassa, S. & Rostami-Tabar, B. & Siemsen, E",2023,,"This book surveys what executives who make decisions based on forecasts and professionals responsible for forecasts should know about forecasting. It discusses how individuals and firms should think about forecasting and guidelines for good practices. It introduces readers to the subject of time series, presents basic and advanced forecasting models, from exponential smoothing across ARIMA to modern Machine Learning methods, and examines human judgment's role in interpreting numbers and identifying forecasting errors and how it should be integrated into organizations. This is a great book to start learning about forecasting if you are new to the area or have some preliminary exposure to forecasting. Whether you are a practitioner, either in a role managing a forecasting team or at operationally involved in demand planning, a software designer, a student or an academic teaching business analytics, operational research, or operations management courses, the book can inspire you to rethink demand forecasting. No prior knowledge of higher mathematics, statistics, operations research, or forecasting is assumed in this book. It is designed to serve as a first introduction to the non-expert who needs to be familiar with the broad outlines of forecasting without specializing in it. This may include a manager overseeing a forecasting group, or a student enrolled in an MBA program, an executive education course, or programs not specialising in analytics. Worked examples accompany the key formulae to show how they can be implemented. Key Features: While there are many books about forecasting technique, very few are published targeting managers. This book fills that gap. It provides the right balance between explaining the importance of demand forecasting and providing enough information to allow a busy manager to read a book and learn something that can be directly used in practice.

Forecast Selection and RepresentativenessManagement Science,"Siemsen, E. & Petropoulos, F",2023,,"Effective approaches to forecast model selection are crucial to improve forecast accuracy and to facilitate the use of forecasts for decision-making processes. Information criteria or cross-validation are common approaches of forecast model selection. Both methods compare forecasts with the respective actual realizations. However, no existing selection method assesses out-of-sample forecasts before the actual values become available—a technique used in human judgment in this context. Research in judgmental model selection emphasizes that human judgment can be superior to statistical selection procedures in evaluating the quality of forecasting models. We, therefore, propose a new way of statistical model selection based on these insights from human judgment. Our approach relies on an asynchronous comparison of forecasts and actual values, allowing for an ex ante evaluation of forecasts via representativeness. We test this criterion on numerous time series. Results from our analyses provide evidence that forecast performance can be improved when models are selected based on their representativeness.

Contrary to this traditional interpretation, our research suggests that budgets can take on a different psychological meaning depending on whether the budget is for a personal or gift purchase. Across 11 studies, we find that consumers aim to spend below their budgets for personal purchases (budget minimizing) but aim to spend the entirety of their budgets for gift purchases (budget maximizing). We differentiate budget maximizing from spending maximizing, showing that gift purchasers are more likely to prefer “at-budget” than “above-budget” purchases. We also show that gift purchasers have weaker savings goals than personal purchasers—a difference that mediates the effect on their budget-minimizing and -maximizing tendencies. We explore multiple reasons that could explain why savings goals are less prevalent among gift purchasers and find an upstream role for price consciousness, guilt, and perceived specialness. Finally, we find that consumers’ preference for spending the entirety of their budgets on gifts was moderated by two separate factors: consumers’ budget slack and salience.

Using a difference-in-differences design examining both affected and unaffected firms, we show that following the enactment of the new limitations, affected firms significantly decrease corporate leverage. Specifically, we find that relative to unaffected U.S. firms, affected firms experience a decrease in leverage of 2.9% of assets; corresponding to about $126 million per firm and $29.8 billion aggregated over our full sample. This represents a debt decrease of 5.8% relative to the average debt to asset ratio for the pre-TCJA affected sample. We find similar results using a triple differences design, which benchmarks debt trends in the U.S. to those of unaffected and pseudo-affected Canadian firms that would be subject to the limitation had they been U.S. firms.

A Quantitative Model of Dynamic Moral HazardReview of Financial Studies,"Ai, H. & Kiku, D. & Li, R",2023,,"Abstract We develop an equilibrium model with moral hazard, which arises because some productivity shocks are privately observed by firm managers only. We characterize the optimal contract and its implications for firm size, growth, and managerial pay-performance sensitivity and exploit them to quantify the severity of the moral hazard problem. Our estimation suggests that unobservable shocks are relatively modest and account for about 10$\%$ of the total variation of firm output. Nonetheless, moral-hazard-induced incentive pay is quantitatively significant and accounts for 50$\%$ of managerial compensation. Eliminating moral hazard would result in about a 1$\%$ increase in aggregate output.",Crossref,91.35802469135803,10.1093/rfs/hhac059,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhac059,Goal 1,0.02078438983171948,False,economic shocks

The Impact of Unionization on Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality: Evidence from Starbucks,"Troncosco, I. & Kim, M. & Chakraborty, I. & Kim, S",2023,,"The US has seen a rise in union movements, but their effects on service industry marketing outcomes like customer satisfaction and perceptions of service quality remain understudied. In this paper, we empirically study the impact on customer satisfaction and perceptions of service as measured by online reviews using the recent Starbucks unionization wave as a case study. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that average review ratings decrease after unionization, suggesting that overall customer satisfaction decreases after unionization. By further leveraging deep learning textual analysis, we find that such a decline is mainly driven by more negative customer sentiment toward service, especially employee behavior. We suggest that a decrease in employee satisfaction, possibly influenced by Starbucks' management responses such as anti-union strategies and non-participation in negotiations, offers a plausible explanation for these findings.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),92.3076923076923,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4657689,Goal 4,0.007903769298644336,False,

Who We Are and How We Govern: The Effect of Identity Orientation on Governance ChoiceJournal of Marketing,"Heide, J. & Bell, S. & Tracey, P",2023,,"The authors draw on emerging research in organization theory to suggest how different firm-level identity orientations (individualistic, relational, or collectivistic) impact governance choice. They develop a conceptual framework that focuses on the relationship between a focal firm’s own identity orientation and that of a value chain partner. The framework identifies a series of match and mismatch scenarios, where the latter represent unique governance problems that are not accounted for by existing theory. Some of the mismatch scenarios involve pseudo-matches that resemble convergent orientations between parties but actually represent governance problems. Theoretically, this framework advances the governance literature by providing a comprehensive and nuanced account of (1) the orientations that parties bring to bear on a relationship, and (2) how their effects vary depending on the interdependence structure between the parties. The authors also advance the general literature on identity orientation by connecting it to concrete governance practices, by showing how multiple internal identity orientations create unique internal governance challenges, and by delineating two possible solutions to these challenges.

Although the structure of the scoring rule is known to bidders, they are uncertain about how the FDIC trades off different bid components. Scoring-rule uncertainty motivates bidders to submit multiple bids for the same failed bank. To evaluate the effects of uncertainty and multiple bidding for FDIC costs, we develop a methodology for analysing multidimensional bidding when the auctioneer’s scoring weights are unknown to bidders. We estimate private valuations for failed-bank assets during the great financial crisis and compute counterfactuals in the absence of scoring uncertainty. Our findings imply a substantial reduction in FDIC resolution costs of between 29.8% ($8.2 billion) and 44.6% ($12.3 billion). These savings can reduce policy-driven banking-sector distortions, since FDIC resolution costs are covered either through special levies on banks or through loans from the US Treasury.

Task interdependence and the gender wage gap: The role of the gender composition of an occupationJournal of Organizational Behavior,"Meuris, J. & Elias, A",2023,,"Abstract People increasingly need to collaborate with others in their workplace to perform their jobs. Studies have shown that task interdependence can have important consequences for teams and organizations, and emerging research suggests that it may be contributing to gender inequality. In this paper, we expand upon this literature to propose a relationship between interdependence and the gender wage gap. Relying on the lack‐of‐fit model, we predicted that the relationship between interdependence and the gender wage gap would vary with the gender composition of the occupation. This prediction was evaluated using multi‐source panel data from a US sample of approximately 8000 individuals. We found that higher levels of interdependence were positively associated with gender differences in wages among people working in male‐dominated occupations but negatively associated with gender differences in wages among those working in female‐dominated occupations. Supplemental analyses using individual fixed effects, an expanded sample, and alternative job characteristics provide support for our arguments.

Contextual Inequality in the Performance Costs of Financial PrecarityJournal of Management,"Meuris, J. & Gladstone, J",2023,,"A substantial proportion of the workforce experiences financial precarity, which is defined as persistent concern about one's personal financial welfare. Research suggests that financial precarity often harms performance at work. In this paper, we investigate whether characteristics of the work context disproportionately occupied by people at the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder (low autonomy, high routinization, high interdependence, low social support) heighten the detrimental impact of financial precarity on performance. Drawing on role stress theory, we propose that these characteristics alter the degree to which the cognitive resources appropriated by financial precarity interfere with the resource requirements of a person's work role. Our predictions are tested using experience sampling data covering 8 consecutive observation days for 956 individuals in the United States (k = 7,015). Analyzing daily observations allows us to distinguish financial precarity from the day-to-day experience of transient financial events. We observed that financial precarity significantly undermined the quality of one's work during a given day, but this relationship was driven by those working in contexts with low levels of autonomy, routinization, and coworker support. This pattern was only observed for those experiencing financial precarity, not those only exposed to a negative financial event in a given day. The research demonstrates that specific characteristics of the work environment can lead to inequality in who bears the performance costs associated with financial precarity.",Crossref,92.1875,10.1177/01492063231153136,https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063231153136,Goal 10,0.0507698783121318,True,income inequality
Can Racial Diversity Attenuate Racial Discrimination in Service Interactions? Evidence from Cite-and-Release Decisions within Police DepartmentsOrganization Science,"Meuris, J",2023,,"Despite the belief that racial diversity in organizations will attenuate racial discrimination in service interactions, the extant literature suggests that it may often exacerbate discrimination by generating intergroup conflict. In this paper, I propose that the influence of racial diversity on racial discrimination in service interactions will depend upon (a) the level of interdependence within an organization and (b) whether an increase in diversity consists of a larger representation of a minority’s own racial group. To test my predictions, I combine interaction-level data covering approximately 200,000 cite-and-release decisions where suspects are either given a summons to attend court at a later date or transported to jail following arrest with longitudinal organization-level data from 93 police departments across the United States. Consistent with prior research, I found that minority suspects were less likely to be cited and released for the same offense relative to White suspects. Racial diversity among sworn officers in a police department exacerbated discrimination in cite-and-release decisions unless officers’ work roles were highly interdependent due to the adoption of community-oriented policing. Focusing on Black and Hispanic suspects, I observed this pattern regardless of whether an increase in racial diversity in the department was characterized by a larger representation of a minority suspect’s own racial group or other minority racial groups. Taken together, the findings suggest that diverse organizations can mitigate the emergence of intergroup conflict that exacerbates racial discrimination in service interactions by fostering interdependencies.

Corporate Social Responsibility and Disclosure Transparency,"Wild, J. & Wild, J",2023,,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and disclosure transparency by examining over 12,000 disclosures of financial statements extending over 20 years. The purpose is to understand how CSR ratings relate to the level of disaggregation in financial statement line items. The study considers additional factors, such as firm size and governance, that can accentuate or moderate this relation. Design/methodology/approach This study applies regression analysis, including interactions, to test the magnitude of the relation between CSR ratings and disclosure transparency. CSR is measured as a composite score that ranks firms on their reputation over numerous indicators compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital International. Disclosure transparency is measured as the level of disaggregation in financial statement line items. Findings The study reveals evidence consistent with the notion that firms which are more CSR conscious are also more transparent with financial statements. Evidence shows that the level of transparency is more sensitive to changes in CSR for firms less CSR conscious. Firm size is found to moderate this relation, whereas enhanced governance accentuates it. Originality/value There is limited research on the relation between CSR ratings and disclosure transparency. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence on the relation between CSR ratings and the disaggregation of financial statement line items. Results from this study help us understand the drivers of disclosure transparency, which can aid regulators, investors and other stakeholders in knowing how such drivers impact managerial decisions on the disaggregation of financial statements.

We evaluated the importance of treatment outcomes to surgeons’ recommendations.MethodsA cross-sectional survey asked thyroid surgeons for their treatment recommendations for a healthy 45-year-old patient with a solitary, low-risk, 2-cm papillary thyroid cancer. The importance of the 10 treatment outcomes (survival, recurrence, etc.) to their recommendation was evaluated using constant sum scaling, a method where 100 points are allocated among the treatment outcomes; more points indicate higher importance. The distribution of points was compared between surgeons recommending total thyroidectomy and surgeons recommending lobectomy using Hottelling’s T2 test.ResultsOf 165 respondents (74.3% response rate), 35.8% (n = 59) recommended total thyroidectomy and 64.2% (n = 106) lobectomy.

These individuals provide an opportunity to understand reputational contagion and the nuanced meaning of “guilt” because the labor market may suspect complicity or infer negligence regardless of whether that is truly the case. We compare these CFOs to a matched sample of non‐fraud CFOs and track both turnover and subsequent employment positions. Non‐implicated CFOs are more likely to experience turnover compared to non‐fraud CFOs, driven in particular by the public revelation of fraud to the labor market. We further find that non‐implicated CFOs are more likely to obtain comparable subsequent employment than non‐fraud CFOs before the fraud is publicly revealed, but not after. In supplementary analyses, we find that turnover rates are highest for non‐implicated CFOs who started their employment with the firm before the fraud began as compared to non‐implicated CFOs who started their employment after the fraud began. These results highlight the labor market significance of the public revelation of fraud and imply that the labor market does not fully distinguish between fraud firm association and general firm performance when making executive hiring decisions.",Crossref,82.70676691729324,10.1111/1911-3846.12817,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12817,Goal 8,0.04301422359042573,False,

Standing on the parent’s shoulder or in its shadow? Alliance partner overlap between employee spinouts and their parentsStrategic Management Journal,"Gaonkar, S. & Moeen, M",2023,,"Abstract Research Summary Employee spinouts, defined as startups founded by prior employees of an industry firm, play a critical role in firm creation and knowledge transfer. Their superior performance often arises from resources and knowledge accrued during employment in parent firms. An understudied question is whether prior employment in parent firms affects an employee spinout's alliance formation, given that alliances are critical to startups' survival and commercial success. This article examines when an employee spinout's alliance partners overlap with the parent's partners. Drawing on alliance formation patterns of U.S. medical device spinouts founded between 1990 and 2013, we find that spinouts building on their parents' technologies tend to have a greater partner overlap with their parents, whereas product market overlap leads to fewer overlapping partners. Managerial Summary A rich context for entrepreneurs to identify new opportunities is through their employment in existing industry firms. When employees leave their job and create a spinout, their employment experience often provides them superior knowledge and expertise. Our study of medical device startups uncovers another distinctive feature of employee spinouts, that is, access to their employer's alliance partners. However, for such opportunities to come to fruition, entrepreneurs need to pay attention to their technical and product market positioning relative to their past employers. When spinouts build on their employer's technologies without challenging them in the product space, they can leverage connections to their employer's partners. This alliance strategy may free spinouts from the alliance formation struggles faced by resource‐deficient startups.",Crossref,92.37668161434978,10.1002/smj.3452,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3452,Goal 8,0.05499369349636157,True,entrepreneurship
Growing Platforms within Platforms: How Platforms Manage the Adoption of Complementor Products in the Presence of Network Effects?Strategic Management Journal,"Agarwal, S. & Miller, C. & Ganco, M",2023,,"Abstract Research Summary Platform owners often use endorsements to actively manage complementor firms. We argue that the direct network effects of complementors' products play a central role in the platform management by its owner. We test our predictions using data on the Apple's promotion of apps. We find that apps with network effects are more likely to receive an award. This likelihood increases when the app is introduced by a developer with a larger market share but declines when introduced in a concentrated segment. The likelihood decreases further if the app is introduced in a concentrated segment by a developer that holds a larger market share. Further, we observe that in concentrated segments, the “challenger” developer has a higher likelihood of receiving the award relative to the leader. Managerial Summary Many products offered through platforms have their own direct network effects. The value of the product for each user grows with the number of other consumers using the product. Many platform owners also actively manage their platforms to ensure platform growth and often use less traditional tools such as product endorsements to achieve this goal. In the context of video games listed in the iOS App Store and the Editors' Choice Awards as a form of product endorsement, we examine the tradeoffs that products with direct network effects (i.e., multiplayer video games) present to the platform owner (Apple). On the one hand, the platform owner may want to promote apps with direct network effects to help them achieve a momentum in terms of user growth. On the other hand, networked apps may become dominant in the segment with negative implications for future growth of the segment and the platform owner's profitability. We find evidence consistent with this tension and find that it critically depends on the complementor strength and market segment concentration. We also observe that in concentrated segments, the “challenger” developer has a higher likelihood of receiving the award relative to the leader.",Crossref,82.67716535433071,10.1002/smj.3487,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3487,Goal 9,0.01747792251769199,False,
Equity Crowdfunding and Access to Capital for User Entrepreneurs: Evidence from a Randomized Field ExperimentMIS Quarterly,"Bapna, S. & Ganco, M",2023,,"We examine whether equity crowdfunding democratizes access to funding for nontraditional user entrepreneurs. User entrepreneurs start by creating a product to serve their own unmet needs with no expectations of monetary profit, then later decide to commercialize the product through entrepreneurship. In contrast, traditional (producer) entrepreneurs take a more profit-driven path to entrepreneurship and start by identifying an opportunity that has commercial potential. Through a randomized field experiment, we randomly reveal to some investors that a firm producing a product used by musicians is founded by a musician and conceal this founder-related information from other investors. Revealing the information suggests that the firm is a user innovator firm and concealing it suggests that the firm is a traditional producer firm. We find that investors are significantly more interested in the traditional producer firm. Through an additional field experiment, we identify that the bias against user entrepreneurs is statistical (based on a response to limited information) rather than taste based (based on an idiosyncratic dislike). Our findings suggest that user entrepreneurs can mitigate investor bias by displaying signals of quality such as those regarding firm growth and broad product appeal.",Crossref,94.68599033816425,10.25300/misq/2022/17006,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2022/17006,Goal 17,0.01164882106222217,False,
Entrepreneurial Teams’ Acquisition of Talent: Evidence from Technology Manufacturing Industries Using a Two-Sided ApproachStrategic Management Journal,"Honoré, F. & Ganco, M",2023,,"One of the established findings in the spinout literature is that founders with prior industry experience assemble larger entrepreneurial teams and create better‐performing startups. We examine the role of prior industry experience in the startups' next stage—its hiring of new employees. We tackle two empirical challenges—the mutual aspect of hiring and the effect of unobserved variables on employees' earnings using a two‐sided matching model. Our results reveal that even firms founded by entrepreneurs without industry experience can attract new employees with such experience if the founders start with a large entrepreneurial team. Further, startups provide new hires with an earnings premium for their industry experience. Our approach illustrates the benefits of matching models over traditional regressions.
Growing startups face the question of who to hire and how much to compensate the new hires. Simultaneously, prospective new hires ask which startup to join and how much their salary will be. We explore these questions using a novel method that tackles the mutual selection process. In the context of five technological manufacturing industries, we find that having industry experience within founding teams may not be necessary to attract new hires with high quality if the startup can signal its own quality through other means such as having a larger founding team. Our results indicate that startups prefer employees with industry experience for which startups offer a wage premium. Thus, employees seeking startup employment benefit from gaining industry experience prior to joining a startup.

Non-life insurance risk classification using categorical embeddingNorth American Actuarial Journal,"Shi, P. & Shi, K",2023,,"This article presents several actuarial applications of categorical embedding in the context of non-life insurance risk classification. In non-life insurance, many rating factors are naturally categorical, and often the categorical variables have a large number of levels. The high cardinality of categorical rating variables presents challenges in the implementation of traditional actuarial methods. Categorical embedding that is proposed in the machine learning literature for handling categorical variables has recently received attention in actuarial studies. The method is inspired by the neural network language models for learning text data and maps a categorical variable into a real-valued representation in the Euclidean space. Using a property insurance claims we demonstrate the use of categorical embedding in three applications. The first shows how embeddings are used to construct rating classes and calculate rating relativities for a single insurance risk. The second concerns predictive modeling for multivariate insurance risks and emphasizes the effects of dependence on tail risks.

There have been wide applications in natural science, healthcare research, actuarial science, and other fields. The performance of existing Tweedie models can be limited on today’s complex data problems with challenging characteristics such as nonlinear effects, high-order interactions, high-dimensionality and sparsity. In this article, we propose a kernel Tweedie model, Ktweedie, and its sparse variant, SKtweedie, that can simultaneously address the above challenges. Specifically, nonlinear effects and high-order interactions can be flexibly represented through a wide range of kernel functions, which is fully learned from the data; In addition, while the Ktweedie can handle high-dimensional data, the SKtweedie with integrated variable selection can further improve the interpretability. We perform extensive simulation studies to justify the prediction and variable selection accuracy of our method, and demonstrate the applications in ratemaking and loss-reserving in general insurance. Overall, the Ktweedie and SKtweedie outperform existing Tweedie models when there exist nonlinear effects and high-order interactions, particularly when the dimensionality is high relative to the sample size.

Platform Governance with Algorithm-based Content Moderation: An Empirical Study on RedditInformation Systems Research,"He, Q. & Hong, Y. & Raghu, T",2023,,"Pratice- and Policy-oriented Abstract Volunteer (human) moderators have been the essential workforce for content moderation to combat growing inappropriate online content. Because volunteer-based content moderation faces challenges in achieving scalable, desirable, and sustainable moderation, many online platforms have started to adopt algorithm-based content moderation tools (bots). However, it is unclear how volunteer moderators react to the bot adoption in terms of their community-policing and -nurturing efforts. Our research collected public moderation records by bots and volunteer moderators from Reddit. Our analysis suggests that bots can augment volunteer moderators. Augmentation results in volunteers shifting their efforts from simple policing work to a broader set of moderations, including policing over subjective rule violations and satisfying the increased needs for community-nurturing activities following the policing actions. This paper has implications for online platform managers looking to scale online activities and explains how volunteers can achieve more effective and sustainable content moderation with the assistance of bots.",Crossref,85.4368932038835,10.1287/isre.2021.0036,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2021.0036,Goal 12,0.04593959789486045,False,

Hamiltonian Sequential Monte Carlo with Application to Consumer Choice BehaviorEconometric Reviews,"Burda, M. & Daviet, R",2023,,"Abstract The practical use of nonparametric Bayesian methods requires the availability of efficient algorithms for posterior inference. The inherently serial nature of traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods imposes limitations on their efficiency and scalability. In recent years, there has been a surge of research activity devoted to developing alternative implementation methods that target parallel computing environments. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), also known as a particle filter, has been gaining popularity due to its desirable properties. SMC uses a genetic mutation-selection sampling approach with a set of particles representing the posterior distribution of a stochastic process. We propose to enhance the performance of SMC by utilizing Hamiltonian transition dynamics in the particle transition phase, in place of random walk used in the previous literature. We call the resulting procedure Hamiltonian Sequential Monte Carlo (HSMC). Hamiltonian transition dynamics have been shown to yield superior mixing and convergence properties relative to random walk transition dynamics in the context of MCMC procedures. The rationale behind HSMC is to translate such gains to the SMC environment. HSMC will facilitate practical estimation of models with complicated latent structures, such as nonparametric individual unobserved heterogeneity, that are otherwise difficult to implement. We demonstrate the behavior of HSMC in a challenging simulation study and contrast its favorable performance with SMC and other alternative approaches. We then apply HSMC to a panel discrete choice model with nonparametric consumer heterogeneity, allowing for multiple modes, asymmetries, and data-driven clustering, providing insights for consumer segmentation, individual level marketing, and price micromanagement.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),84.7457627118644,10.1080/07474938.2022.2140982,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94d5c45105dac3fb4bff85ab65812b0f374da5cf,Goal 9,0.007547498931297332,False,

Resource allocation and growth strategies in a multi-plant firm: Kanegafuchi Spinners in the early 20th centuryStrategic Management Journal,"Yamaguchi, S. & Braguinsky, S. & Okazaki, T. & Yuki, T",2023,,"Abstract Research Summary Using detailed plant‐ and individual‐level data from a major Japanese cotton spinning company in the early 20th century, we examine the within‐firm allocation of skilled human capital in conjunction with investment in physical capital, accompanying the firm's evolving strategic priorities. We show that the firm leveraged unit‐level two‐way complementarity between managerial talent and strategically important plants when the task was achieving large‐scale output and positioning for a competitive cost advantage. The task of conducting product differentiation, however, ushered in “three‐way complementarity,” where educated engineering human capital and capable managers needed to be bundled with specialized physical capital. A deeper dive into the “nano‐economics” of resource allocation reveals that educated engineers experiencing product differentiation in pioneering plants were reallocated to other plants also pursuing product differentiation. Managerial Summary Effectively allocating critical resources, such as skilled human capital, across establishments in alignment with strategic priorities is a key managerial issue. Through an in‐depth case study of a major Japanese cotton spinning company in the early 20th century, we illustrate how the company shifted the resource allocation policy in response to different strategic management priorities. Initially, the company assigned managerial talent to larger plants requiring operational improvement, leveraging a competitive cost advantage for a standard product. Yet, as the company transitioned toward product differentiation via new production technologies, skilled engineers and plant managers were allocated together to a few selected plants initiating product differentiation.

The authors utilize monthly data on 325 national consumer packaged goods brands in 35 categories across 17 years from the United Kingdom to obtain quarterly sales-based brand equity estimates. The two preeminent brand factors are distribution and assortment. Distribution is by far the most important factor in contractions. It is also the most important factor in expansions. In short, in good times and bad times, extensively distributed brands win. A wide assortment is also a strong contributor to brand equity in expansions, while it does not destroy brand equity in contractions. The authors further find that advertising spending, premium price positioning, umbrella branding structure, and market leadership matter in expansions and/or contractions, and the magnitude of their effects on brand equity is relatively modest.

Meta-Analysis as a Business Research MethodOxford Encyclopedia of Business and Management,"Stajkovic, A. & Stajkovic, K",2022,,"Mounting complexity in the world, coupled with new discoveries and more journal space to publish the findings, have spurred research on a host of topics in just about every discipline of social science. Research forays have also generated unprecedented disagreements. For many topics, empirical findings exist but results are mixed: some show positive relationships, some show negative relationships, and some show no statistically significant relationship. How, then, do researchers go about discovering systematic variation across studies to understand and predict forces that impinge on human functioning? Historically, qualitative literature reviews were performed in conjunction with the counting of statistically significant effects. This approach fails to consider effect magnitudes and sample sizes, and thus its conclusions can be misleading. A more precise way to reach conclusions from research literature is via meta-analysis, defined as a set of statistical procedures that enable researchers to derive quantitative estimates of average and moderator effects across available studies. Since its introduction in 1976, meta-analysis has developed into an authoritative source of information for ascertaining the generalizability of research findings. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that meta-analyses in the field of management garner, on average, three times as many citations as single studies. A framework for conducting meta-analysis explains why it should be used, outlines what it has yielded to society, and introduces the reader to a fundamental conception and a misconception. More specifics follow about data collection and study selection criteria and implications of publication bias. How to convert estimates from individual studies to a common scale to be able to average them, what to consider in choosing a meta-analytic method, how to compare the procedures, and what information to include when reporting results are presented next. The article concludes with a discussion of nuances and limitations, and suggestions for future research and practice. Science builds knowledge cumulatively from numerous studies, which, more often than not, differ in their characteristics (e.g., research design, participants, setting, sample size). Some findings are in concert and some are not. Through its quantitative foundations, conjoint with theory-guiding hypotheses, meta-analysis offers statistical means of analyzing disparate research designs and conflicting results and discovering consistencies in a seemingly inconsistent literature. Research conclusions reached by a theory-driven, well-conducted meta-analysis are almost certainly more accurate and reliable than those from any single study.",Crossref,91.13924050632912,10.1093/acrefore/9780190224851.013.213,https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190224851.013.213,Goal 9,0.01555819046246152,False,scientific research
Matching Returning Donors to Projects on Philanthropic Crowdfunding PlatformsManagement Science,"Song, Y. & Li, Z. & Sahoo, N",2022,,"We propose an approach to match returning donors to fundraising campaigns on philanthropic crowdfunding platforms. It is based on a structural econometric model of utility-maximizing donors who can derive both altruistic (from the welfare of others) and egoistic (from personal motivations) utilities from donating—a unique feature of philanthropic giving. We estimate our model using a comprehensive data set from DonorsChoose.org—the largest crowdfunding platform for K–12 education. We find that the proposed model more accurately identifies the projects that donors would like to donate to on their return in a future period, and how much they would donate, than popular personalized recommendation approaches in the literature. From the estimated model, we find that primarily egoistic factors motivate over two-thirds of the donations, but, over the course of the fundraising campaign, both motivations play a symbiotic role: egoistic motivations drive the funding in the early stages of a campaign when the viability of the project is still unclear, whereas altruistic motivations help reach the funding goal in the later stages. Finally, we design a recommendation policy using the proposed model to maximize the total funding each week considering the needs of all projects and the heterogeneous budgets and preferences of donors. We estimate that over the last 14 weeks of the data period, such a policy would have raised 2.5% more donation, provided 9% more funding to the projects by allocating them to more viable projects, funded 17% more projects, and provided 15% more utility to the donors from the donations than the current system. Counterintuitively, we find that the policy that maximizes total funding each week leads to higher utility for the donors over time than a policy that maximizes donors’ total utility each week. The reason is that the funding-maximizing policy focuses donations on more viable projects, leading to more funded projects, and, ultimately, higher realized donors’ utility.

Qualitative Disclosure and Credit Analysts’ Soft Rating AdjustmentsEuropean Accounting Review,"Bozanic, Z. & Kraft, P. & Tillet, A",2022,,"Abstract
 Using both dictionary-based and topic modelling approaches, we examine whether and how credit analysts use borrowers’ qualitative disclosures to extract information pertaining to credit risk in making their assessments. We first decompose publicly-available ratings into qualitative factors (soft adjustments) and quantitative factors (hard adjustments). We find that credit analysts’ soft adjustments, but not the hard adjustments, reflect information in borrowers’ qualitative disclosures. Next, our results indicate that the association between firms’ qualitative disclosures and soft adjustments varies depending upon the rating agency’s reliance on public disclosure, access to management, and overall market uncertainty. Finally, we examine whether analysts’ use of credit risk-relevant information from borrowers’ qualitative disclosures increases the informativeness of credit rating downgrades. We find that the credit rating downgrades of borrowers that provide more qualitative disclosures are more informative than those who do not; however, the increase in informativeness diminishes after the Dodd-Frank Act, when legal liability and regulatory penalties for credit rating agencies increased.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),90.1639344262295,10.1080/09638180.2022.2038227,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf188b54789649439318290425d17e6dc1545051,Goal 16,0.01117828292292871,False,
"The Effects of Naloxone Access Laws on Opioid Abuse, Mortality, and CrimeJournal of Law and Economics","Doleac, J. & Mukherjee, A",2022,,"The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid abuse. In response, states have implemented policies including increased access to naloxone, a drug that can save lives when administered during an overdose. There is a concern that widespread naloxone access may unintentionally lead to increased or riskier opioid use by reducing the risk of death from overdose, however. In this paper, we use the staggered timing of state-level naloxone access laws as a natural experiment to measure the effects of broadening access to this lifesaving drug. We find that broadened access led to more opioid-related emergency room visits and more opioid-related theft, with no net measurable reduction in opioid-related mortality. We conclude that naloxone has a clear and important role in harm reduction, yet its ability to combat the opioid epidemic’s death toll may be limited without complementary efforts.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),95.71428571428571,10.1086/719588,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ee4ce4b1af93356bca9f7b8d1474e8d4ad02f9b,Goal 16,0.04366689718057278,False,

Reconciling female agentic advantage and disadvantage with the CADDIS measure of agency,"Ma, A. & Rosette, A. & Koval, C",2022,,"Contradictory findings about whether agentic women are penalized or rewarded persist in gender and leadership research. To account for these divergent effects, we distinguish between agentic traits that people believe female leaders ought to possess (i.e., agency prescriptions) and ought not possess (i.e., agency proscriptions). We draw on expectancy violation theory to suggest that an agentic advantage is elicited when women are perceived to violate agency prescriptions (e.g., competence), whereas an agentic disadvantage is elicited when they are perceived to violate agency proscriptions (e.g., dominance). We first developed and validated a new, six-factor measure of agency in Studies 1 and 2, CADDIS (i.e., Competent agency, Ambitious agency, Dominant agency, Diligent agency, Independent agency, and Self-assured agency). We theorized that these agency factors represented distinct agency prescriptions and proscriptions for men and women. In Studies 3-5, we found that this six-factor conceptualization of agency not only reconciles existing tensions within the gender and leadership literature, but also leads to a different understanding of past conclusions-an agentic advantage occurs when women are perceived to possess competent agency, diligent agency, and independent agency, and an agentic disadvantage occurs when women are perceived to possess dominant agency.

Do Financial Incentives Help or Harm Performance in Interesting Tasks?Journal of Applied Psychology,"Kim, J. & Gerhart, B. & Fang, M",2022,,"There continues to be disagreement about whether financial incentives help or harm performance, especially in interesting tasks. Although the Jenkins, Mitra, Gupta, and Shaw (1998) meta-analysis finds a positive effect of incentives, including in interesting tasks (reported ρ ^ = +.34; our computed δ = +.79), a more recent and widely cited meta-analysis by Weibel et al.

Thus, the effect size for interesting tasks differs by .92 standard deviation (SD) between the two meta-analyses, a very large difference. We incorporate primary studies from these two meta-analyses and other sources in a new, more complete meta-analysis of incentives-performance in interesting and noninteresting tasks. We also examine additional key moderators (incentive intensity, how motivation-driven performance is, and autonomy). We find that the incentives-performance relationship is positive in both interesting (δ = +.58) and noninteresting tasks (δ = +.52). In addition, we find that the positive incentives-performance relationship is robust to not only task interest, but also to incentive intensity, how motivation-driven performance is, and autonomy.

Features of the US National Flood Insurance Program offer insights into consumers' coverage over large stakes that are not typically possible in other markets. We examine the coverage limits (the amount of a home's value that is insured) of over 100,000 households. We determine the optimal coverage based on a standard expected utility calibration. This model indicates that consumers should purchase a low limit and retain much of their exposure due to the high premium loads in our sample. Instead, households in the sample typically fully insure their homes, paying premiums well above their contract's expected value. We investigate possible explanations for homeowners' coverage limits and conclude that some combination of industry practices that emphasize fully insuring and probability distortions in decision‐making are likely explanations.",Crossref,85.71428571428571,10.1111/jori.12363,https://doi.org/10.1111/jori.12363,Goal 3,0.02279918462165298,False,

This study compares the frequency of ED use among a cohort of individuals with well-defined cognitive performance (cognitively intact, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and ADRD). Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of English-speaking, community-dwelling individuals evaluated at four health system-based multidisciplinary memory clinics from 2014–2016. We obtained demographic and clinical data, including neuropsychological testing results, through chart review and linkage to electronic health record data. We characterized the frequency and quantity of ED use within one year (6 months before and after) of cognitive evaluation and compared ED use between the three groups using bivariate and multivariate approaches. Results Of the 779 eligible patients, 89 were diagnosed as cognitively intact, 372 as MCI, and 318 as ADRD. The proportion of subjects with any annual ED use did not increase significantly with greater cognitive impairment: cognitively intact (16.9%), MCI (26.1%), and ADRD (28.9%) ( p = 0.072). Average number of ED visits increased similarly: cognitively intact (0.27, SD 0.72), MCI (0.41, SD 0.91), and ADRD (0.55, SD 1.25) ( p = 0.059). Multivariate logistic regression results showed that patients with MCI (odds ratio (OR) 1.62; CI = 0.87–3.00) and ADRD (OR 1.84; CI = 0.98–3.46) did not significantly differ from cognitively intact adults in any ED use. Multivariate negative binomial regression found patients with MCI (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.38; CI = 0.79–2.41) and ADRD (IRR 1.76, CI = 1.00–3.10) had elevated but non-significant risk of an ED visit compared to cognitively intact individuals. Conclusion Though there was no significant difference in ED use in this small sample from one health system, our estimates are comparable to other published work. Results suggested a trend towards higher utilization among adults with MCI or ADRD compared to those who were cognitively intact.

Based on such accurate response curves from GANNM, the optimized budget allocation is estimated to yield a 11.2% increase in customer traffic compared with the original allocation. Our findings provide novel insights on managing mall campaigns. Mall managers should increase marketing spending to areas that were likely overlooked before and avoid over-crowding budget to campaigns during times with high levels of competition and are likely already over-marketed. We provide empirical evidence showing that the recent trend of employing novel approaches for enhancing customer experience in physical stores can effectively encourage customers to visit malls.

They demonstrate the contextually adaptable nature of this framework by analyzing the authenticity contradictions generated by the cultural tensions between “conscious capitalism”—a market logic that encompasses both global brands and small independent businesses, such as a farm-to-table restaurant or an organic food co-op—and the elitist critique. The Slow Food movement provides a case study for analyzing how consumers, producers, and entrepreneurs who identify with conscious capitalist ideals understand these disauthenticating, elitist associations and the strategies they use to counter them.

We extend this research by examining the spillover effect of securities litigation on industry peers using a sample of disclosure-related litigation—distinct from events such as restatements and SEC enforcement. We find investors respond immediately as peers exhibit negative abnormal returns before and after case filings. Additionally, peers provide more voluntary earnings and sales forecasts. Notably, investors and peers respond primarily to cases that eventually settle, where litigation costs are concentrated. Further, disclosure results are concentrated in growth firms, where voluntary disclosure is most important, and in low-litigation industries, where litigation is more noteworthy. Peers also adjust attributes of mandatory disclosures: disclosures become shorter, more readable, and contain fewer litigation-related terms. These changes appear successful as peers have lower future litigation incidence. Collectively, our findings indicate securities litigation has significant effects beyond the firms that directly face litigation.

The Effects of Independent Director Litigation RiskContemporary Accounting Research,"Donelson, D. & Tori, E. & Yust, C",2022,,"ABSTRACT Does personal litigation risk for independent directors materially affect firm valuation, compensation‐related issues for independent directors, and board composition decisions? We use the unexpected In re Investors Bancorp decision in 2017 by the Delaware Supreme Court, which lowered the liability threshold only for directors in derivative litigation over their own equity grants and increased their future litigation risk, to examine these issues. Understanding changes in independent director litigation risk is important because such changes may affect directors' willingness or ability to serve on boards and advise executives. Consistent with our predictions, investors and firms reacted to the decision. First, Delaware firms experienced significant negative short‐window returns, concentrated in high‐litigation‐risk firms where equity compensation is most important. Second, Delaware firms responded by increasing the use of director compensation caps, highlighting that they did not pay excessive amounts. Third, Delaware firms with higher abnormal director compensation decreased director compensation, while those with lower abnormal director compensation did not. Finally, Delaware firms added higher‐quality directors to the compensation committee, consistent with concerns about heightened litigation risk for those positions. Notably, these new, higher‐quality directors did not accept lower pay, unlike holdover directors who previously served on the committee. Overall, results are consistent with director litigation concerns having a significant effect on shareholder value and firm and director behavior.",Crossref,93.87755102040816,10.1111/1911-3846.12750,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12750,Goal 8,0.005610767260262686,False,
Is tax aggressiveness associated with tax litigation risk? Evidence from D&O InsuranceReview of Accounting Studies,"Donelson, D. & Glenn, J. & Yust, C",2022,,"This study uses directors’ and officers’ (D&O) insurance data to examine the relation between tax aggressiveness and tax litigation risk. D&O insurance covers litigation costs for tax-related cases. Thus D&O insurance premiums provide an independent and direct assessment of the risk in a firm’s tax aggressive strategies, which mitigates some of the challenges in studying tax risk. Based on pricing decisions, D&O insurers appear to view tax aggressiveness, as measured by industry- and size-adjusted cash effective tax rates (a measure where higher rates are associated with more aggressiveness), as increasing tax-related litigation risk. Regarding tax uncertainty, premiums increase (decrease) as unrecognized tax benefits (UTB-related settlements with tax authorities) increase. Finally, D&O insurers focus on firms with outbound tax haven activity when pricing tax aggressiveness. Overall, this suggests D&O insurers include aspects of both low taxes and tax uncertainty when pricing tax litigation risk.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),93.50649350649351,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11142-021-09612-w,Goal 13,0.006748137302703583,False,

How Do National Firms Respond to Local Cost Shocks?American Economic Review,"Butters, R. & Sacks, D. & Seo, B",2022,,"Recent research shows prices are insensitive to local demand conditions because national chains charge geographically uniform prices.

We find local cost shocks are passed through to local prices, with no spillovers to unaffected stores in otherwise affected chains, and at similar rates for national and local chains. Firms adjust local prices according to local cost changes, suggesting retailers respond asymmetrically to local cost and demand shocks.

Modeling the Risk in Mortality ProjectionsOperations Research,"Zhu, N. & Bauer, D",2022,,"Capturing the Uncertainty in Long-Term Mortality Forecasts The uncertainty in future longevity presents a substantial risk factor for insurance companies, pension funds, and retirement systems. In “Modeling the Risk in Mortality Projections,” Zhu and Bauer present novel stochastic models for analyzing this longevity risk that focus on the uncertainty associated with long-term mortality projections and capture the evolution of mortality forecasts over the past decades. They arrive at their models by analyzing time series of mortality forecasts in a forward modeling framework, which contrasts with conventional stochastic mortality models that are built on age-specific realized mortality rates. The authors showcase their models in exemplifying financial applications in both traditional life insurance markets and the emerging longevity risk transfer market. A key takeaway is that uncertainty in positions that depend on the long-term evolution of mortality is substantially greater under their models than suggested by conventional models.",Crossref,83.33333333333333,10.1287/opre.2021.2255,https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2021.2255,Goal 3,0.08458841583189412,True,premature mortality
Seeing the Bigger Picture? Ramping-Up Production with the Use of Augmented RealityManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Wuttke, D. & Uphadyay, A. & Siemsen, E. & Wuttke-Linneman, A",2022,,"Problem definition: Firms increasingly use augmented reality (AR) devices to improve their production ramp-up processes. These devices appear useful, yet little is known about their broader impact on worker productivity and behavior. Academic/practical relevance: Efficient production ramp-ups are particularly important when product life cycles are short. An ongoing debate among academics and practitioners pertains to how Industry 4.0, and AR devices in particular, can accelerate the ramp-up. The current study provides empirical evidence related to AR in the production ramp-up context, examines the strengths and weaknesses of AR, and tests four hypotheses, leading to a more nuanced view of AR use in the manufacturing ramp-up. Methodology: A framed field experiment in a manufacturing plant provides a test of how quickly workers can perform new tasks with and without AR support and how the use of AR affects their ability to suggest process improvements. Results: When faced with a new task, workers instructed by AR smart glasses use 43.8% less time to complete the task compared with a control group that relies on paper-based instructions. However, workers that use AR glasses consistently use 23% more time than the control group when both groups repeat the task without either AR or paper-based instructions. Task difficulty moderates this relationship; workers assigned to a more difficult task benefit the most from AR instructions. After the devices are removed, workers instructed based on paper improve their productivity faster through learning than those instructed by AR. In addition, the former group suggests better process improvements than the latter one. Managerial implications: Although these results indicate substantially higher productivity resulting from AR devices, they also support the view that, once instructed through AR devices, workers come to rely on this new technology without fully internalizing the task. This failure to internalize their task then leads workers to suggest less useful process improvements.",Crossref,86.13138686131387,10.1287/msom.2021.1070,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.1070,Goal 9,0.01805078273824294,False,industry

In a meta-analysis of responses to 50 unique moral dilemmas, furnished by undergraduates, online panelists, and passers-by, we compared 8,696 self-choice responses (from participants who decided what option they choose) with 8,548 advisor responses (from participants who recommended what option others should choose). We found that when advising others, participants favored deontological options more, recommending these options over the more utilitarian options that participants chose for themselves (d = .112).

However, people can also lie by omission, by withholding important yet true information. In this research, we investigate when people are more likely to tell a lie of omission. In three studies, with tests among undergraduates, online sample respondents, and candidates for U.S. Senate, we found that people in a gain frame were more likely to lie by omission (vs. commission), and vice versa for a loss frame. Moreover, participants rated lies of commission in a gain frame as the least acceptable type of deception, suggesting why people may avoid telling this kind of lie.

Our results thus contribute to research on maximizing and specifically the “maximization paradox”—the notion that maximizers make better choices than satisficers yet feel worse. Taking a post-choice perspective to maximizing, we examined the paradox after a choice is made. In addition, our research sheds new light on scholarship in consumer behavior. Rich with scientific insights that reveal how to promote, nudge, or alter a product-choice, research in consumer behavior has rarely tested what naturally follows: how much a chosen product is used or consumed.

In Study 1, we found that giving a gift to one's romantic partner changes givers' interpretation of which behaviors constitute infidelity. Specifically, we found that givers (vs. nongivers) classified their questionable behaviors (e.g., sending a flirtatious text to someone other than their partner) less as a form of cheating on their partner. In Study 2, we examined how politely participants behave when delivering bad news to a friend. We found that givers (vs. nongivers) wrote significantly less polite messages to their friend. In Study 3, we tested real gifts that people give to friends and found givers (vs. nongivers) subsequently made more selfish decisions at their friends' expense. In all, our research refines the oft‐cited axiomatic assumption that gift giving strengthens relationships and illuminates the potential for future research to examine how decision making can alter interpersonal, romantic relationships.",Crossref,91.13924050632912,10.1002/bdm.2252,https://doi.org/10.1002/bdm.2252,Goal 5,0.009839140523236528,False,

Further, we explore the mediating effects of care intensity in the ED on post-ED care use. Academic/practical relevance: ED crowding has been a pressing concern in healthcare systems in the United States and other developed countries. As such, many researchers have studied its effects on outcomes within the ED. In contrast, we present novel results regarding the impacts of ED crowding on system performance outside the ED—specifically, on post-ED care utilization. Methodology: We utilize a data set assembled from more than four years of microdata from a large U.S. hospital and exhaustive billing data in an integrated health system. We use count models and instrumental variable analyses to answer the proposed research questions. Results: We find that there is an increasing concave relationship between ED physician workload and post-ED care use. When ED workload increases from its fifth percentile to the median, the number of post-discharge care events (i.e., medical services) for patients who are discharged home from the ED increases by 5%, and it is stable afterward. Further, we identify physician test-ordering behavior as a mechanism for this effect; when the physician is busier, she responds by ordering more tests for less severe patients. We document that this “extra” testing generates “extra” post-ED care utilization for these patients. Managerial implications: This paper contributes new insights on how physician and patient behaviors under ED crowding impact a previously unstudied system performance measure: post-ED care utilization. Our findings suggest that prior studies estimating the cost of ED crowding underestimate the true effect, as they do not consider the “extra” post-ED care utilization.

Capacity Rationing in Primary Care: Provider Availability Shocks and Care Channel DiversionManagement Science,"Canamucio, A. & Bavafa, H. & Marcus, S. & Terwiesch, C. & Werner, R",2022,,"We study capacity rationing by servers facing differentiated customer classes using data from the Veterans Health Administration, which is the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S. Using more than 11 million health encounters over two years in which the system was capacity constrained, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of provider availability shocks on care channel diversion and delays. The outcomes studied include emergency room (ER) visits broken down by type, urgent care center visits, office and phone visits with one’s own versus another provider, post-ER follow-up visits, and ER readmissions. Availability shocks in our analysis are a residualized measure characterizing weeks in which the provider has fewer (or more) office appointments than expected based on typical patterns. The main finding is that moving from two standard deviations above to two standard deviations below in availability shocks increases ER visits by 2.4%, or about 20,000 yearly ER visits. Interestingly, the increase in ER visits is only present for the non-emergent category, indicating differentiated service to emergent and non-emergent care requests; capacity-constrained providers still tend to the patients in most need. Another finding is that provider availability shocks delay and divert post-ER follow-up care.

First, in contrast to methods that rely on word frequency, they develop a deep learning convolutional–long short-term memory hybrid model to account for language structure. The convolutional layer accounts for spatial structure (adjacent word groups or phrases), and long short-term memory accounts for the sequential structure of language (sentiment distributed and modified across nonadjacent phrases). Second, they address the problem of missing attributes in text when constructing attribute sentiment scores, as reviewers write about only a subset of attributes and remain silent on others. They develop a model-based imputation strategy using a structural model of heterogeneous rating behavior. Using Yelp restaurant review data, they show superior attribute sentiment scoring accuracy with their model. They identify three reviewer segments with different motivations: status seeking, altruism/want voice, and need to vent/praise. Surprisingly, attribute mentions in reviews are driven by the need to inform and vent/praise rather than by attribute importance. The heterogeneous model-based imputation performs better than other common imputations and, importantly, leads to managerially significant corrections in restaurant attribute ratings.

Since competition leads to the elimination of intra-industry profitability differences, this investigation provides evidence on whether competitors act on information about rivals. Using an industry-level transparency measure that integrates corporate reporting by firm managers, private information search and communication by analysts, and information dissemination by the media, we find that transparency is associated with faster reductions in within-industry profitability differences. Using aggregate financial statement data for public and private firms provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, we further find that differences in profitability between public and private firms are less persistent when public firms’ profitability exceeds private firms’ profitability, consistent with theoretical and anecdotal arguments that public firms are at a competitive disadvantage because they are required to be more transparent than private counterparts. Our results are robust to the use of local newspaper closures and mergers as exogenous shocks to transparency. Collectively, these findings indicate that information transparency facilitates competition, leading to the erosion of profitability differences within an industry.

An Unintended Consequence of Product Upgrades: How Upgrades Can Make Current Customers Feel Left BehindJournal of Marketing Research,"Jung, W. & Peck, J. & Palmeira, M. & Kim, K",2022,,"In today’s advanced economies, consumers are constantly exposed to an increasing number of upgraded products. This research examines consumer response to a brand's launching of an upgraded product and identifies the consumer's ownership status of a previous version of the product as a key dimension that can influence their reaction. Contrary to common intuition, the research demonstrates that while the release of an upgraded product is received positively by nonowners of a previous version, this is not always the case for owners. The authors propose that owners respond unfavorably because the new upgrade increases perceived distance between the owners and the brand as the brand progresses forward with the enhanced products. That is, when the new product replaces an existing product the consumers own, consumers perceive that the brand is moving away from them. This negative effect of an upgrade is attenuated if the owners are provided with an extra source of connection to the brand. The authors investigate this phenomenon in five studies and discuss the implications of their findings.",Crossref,91.005291005291,10.1177/00222437221078551,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437221078551,Goal 12,0.01385170671309119,False,consumer behavior
Young Children Infer Psychological Ownership from StewardshipDevelopmental Psychology,"Cleroux, A. & Peck, J. & Friedman, O",2022,,"Although people of take care of their own possessions, they also engage in stewardship and take care of things they do not own. Here, we examine what young children infer when they observe stewardship behavior of an object. Through four experiments on predominantly middle-class Canadian children (total N = 350, 168 girls and 182 boys from a predominantly White and middle-class region), we find that children as young as four or five infer feelings of ownership from stewardship behaviors, and distinguish between psychological and legal ownership. They also understand that psychological and legal ownership are independent as one can exist without the other, and children as young as 3 may link stewardship with welfare concerns. We also suggest that while stewardship has been shown to be a consequence of psychological ownership, it is also likely to be an antecedent. As future stewards of our resources, young children’s understanding of the link between psychological ownership and stewardship links directly to sustainability concerns.

Observing Product Touch: The Vicarious Haptic Effect in Digital Marketing and Virtual RealityJournal of Marketing Research,"Luangrath, A. & Peck, J. & Hedgcock, W. & Xu, Y",2022,,"Retail is rapidly evolving to construct virtual environments for consumers. Online product images, videos, and virtual reality (VR) interfaces enliven consumer experiences and are a source of product information. Because consumers are unable to physically touch products in these digital environments, this research examines vicarious touch, or the observation of a hand in physical contact with a product in a digital environment. Across eight studies, the authors use images, GIFs, and VR to show that vicarious touch affects consumers’ psychological ownership and product valuation due to the active nature of product touch, which results in a felt sense of body ownership of the virtual hand. This is termed the “vicarious haptic effect.” Results demonstrate that it is not enough to show a hand in an advertisement; the hand must be touching a product. The vicarious haptic effect is strongest for people who become highly stimulated by an immersive VR experience (i.e., measured via the elevation in heart rate). The vicarious haptic effect is attenuated if the viewed interaction does not represent a diagnostic hand movement.

Managerial Incentives and the Valuation of International Joint Venture Formation,"Wild, J. & Wild, J. & Wild, K",2022,,"Strategic management decisions and actions involving international joint venture formations are significant to many firms and have major economic consequences. Previous empirical evidence on the effects of joint venture formation announcements on shareholder wealth reveals that firm value is more often positively impacted. However, many previous analyses of shareholder wealth from joint venture formations do not fully explore cross-sectional differences in managerial incentives to pursue these international investments. The primary purpose of this study is to exploit these cross-sectional differences using agency theory to explain managerial behavior and subsequent shareholder effects. This study capitalizes on agency theory’s notion that managers are not necessarily motivated solely by the maximization of firm value, but instead are interested in maximizing their own utility. The study’s findings are consistent with agency theoretic hypotheses based on a broad cross-section of international joint ventures. Results demonstrate that shareholder returns to international joint venture formation exhibit considerable variability and, importantly, are at least partially explained by cross-sectional differences in agency incentives. Specifically, returns to shareholders are positively related to the level of managerial ownership and inversely related to the level of free cash flow. Moreover, a positive relation is found between shareholder returns and the joint interaction between leverage and free cash flow. These findings indicate that the effect of international joint venture formation on shareholder value is not uniform and, more importantly is at least partly influenced by managers’ agency incentives.",Crossref,100.0,10.55217/102.v15i2.576,https://doi.org/10.55217/102.v15i2.576,Goal 17,0.02754910151836581,False,
"Explanatory Power of Earnings for Returns: Nonstationarity, Disaggregation and TimelinessReview of Accounting and Finance","Wild, J. & Wild, J",2022,,"Purpose This study aims to examine several hypotheses, in conjunction with fundamental accounting concepts, to explain variations in the explanatory power of earnings for returns. Design/methodology/approach The authors explore three factors for their impact on the explanatory power of earnings. First, the accounting period preceding the earnings report is characterized by distinct intratemporal subperiod behavior. Recognizing this intratemporal nonstationarity is hypothesized to increase the explanatory power of earnings. Second, disaggregation of earnings into operating components is hypothesized to increase the explanatory power of earnings. Moreover, joint consideration of these first two factors is investigated. Third, the authors hypothesize that recognizing fundamental accounting concepts such as timeliness, predictive value, objectivity and verifiability offer key insights into the explanatory power of earnings. Findings The authors explore a sample of firms with management forecasts, which yields natural intratemporal subperiods – preforecast, forecast and realization periods – to generate hypotheses rooted in fundamental accounting concepts. The empirical evidence shows that recognition of nonstationary intratemporal behavior and earnings disaggregation yields a significant increase in the explanatory power of earning for returns. These findings are linked to fundamental concepts of accounting information. Originality/value This study is unique as it examines the joint role of nonstationarity and disaggregation in assessing the information conveyed in earnings. Importantly, results on these factors are linked to fundamental accounting concepts of timeliness, predictive value, objectivity and verifiability, along with their inherent trade-offs.",Crossref,82.75862068965517,10.1108/raf-09-2021-0239,https://doi.org/10.1108/raf-09-2021-0239,Goal 15,0.01029803603099317,False,
From Noise to Bias: Overconfidence in New Product ForecastingManagement Science,"Feiler, D. & Tong, J",2022,,"We study decision behavior in the selection, forecasting, and production for a new product. In a stylized behavioral model and five experiments, we generate new insight into when and why this combination of tasks can lead to overconfidence (specifically, overestimating the demand). We theorize that cognitive limitations lead to noisy interpretations of signal information, which itself is noisy. Because people are statistically naive, they directly use their noisy interpretation of the signal information as their forecast, thereby underaccounting for the uncertainty that underlies it. This process leads to unbiased forecast errors when considering products in isolation, but leads to positively biased forecasts for the products people choose to launch due to a selection effect. We show that this selection-driven overconfidence can be sufficiently problematic that, under certain conditions, choosing the product randomly can actually yield higher profits than when individuals themselves choose the product to launch. We provide mechanism evidence by manipulating the interpretation noise through information complexity—showing that even when the information is equivalent from a Bayesian perspective, more complicated information leads to more noise, which, in turn, leads to more overconfidence in the chosen products. Finally, we leverage this insight to show that getting a second independent forecast for a chosen product can significantly mitigate the overconfidence problem, even when both individuals have the same information.

Subject demographics differ across the samples, but average insurance demand is similar. However, choice patterns suggest online subjects are less cognitively engaged — they have more variation in their demand and react less to changes in exogenous factors of the insurance situation. Applying data quality filters does not lead to more comparable demand patterns between the samples. Additionally, while online subjects pass comprehension questions at the same rate as in ‐ person subjects, they show more random behavior in other questions. We find that online subjects are more likely to engage in “ coarse thinking, ” choosing from a reduced set of options.

Who Chooses Commitment? Evidence and Welfare ImplicationsReview of Economic Studies,"Sydnor, J",2022,,"Abstract This article investigates whether offers of commitment contracts, in the form of self-imposed choice-set restrictions and penalties with no financial upside, are well-targeted tools for addressing self-control problems. In an experiment on gym attendance (N$=1{,}248$), we examine take-up of commitment contracts and also introduce a separate elicitation task to identify actual and perceived time inconsistency. There is high take-up of commitment contracts for greater gym attendance, resulting in significant increases in exercise. However, this take-up is influenced both by noisy valuation and incorrect beliefs about one’s time inconsistency. Approximately half of the people who take up commitment contracts for higher gym attendance also take up commitment contracts for lower gym attendance. There is little association between commitment contract take-up and reduced-form and structural estimates of actual or perceived time inconsistency. A novel information treatment providing an exogenous shock to awareness of time inconsistency reduces demand for commitment contracts. Structural estimates of a model of quasi-hyperbolic discounting and gym attendance imply that offering our commitment contracts lowers consumer surplus and is less socially efficient than utilizing linear exercise subsidies that achieve the same average change in behaviour.",Crossref,87.12871287128712,10.1093/restud/rdab056,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdab056,Goal 12,0.0060291674669384,False,

Zooming in or zooming out: Entrants’ product portfolios in the nascent drone industryStrategic Management Journal,"Shermon, A. & Moeen, M",2022,,"Abstract Research Summary Faced with demand uncertainty and heterogeneity in a nascent industry, entrants often consider how many customer segments to serve by tailoring the usage breadth of their product portfolios. Portfolio usage breadth is the extent to which products in a portfolio collectively span distinct customer segments. We suggest that when entrants have use experience in contexts that are potential users of the new product, their portfolios exhibit low usage breadth, due to demand‐oriented cognition and knowledge. The relationship is stronger for diversifying entrants relative to startups. The empirical context is the U.S. commercial drone industry, wherein entrants need to adapt their product portfolios for five robust and distinct customer segments of photography, short‐distance inspection, long‐distance surveying, agriculture, and aerial supply chain management. Managerial Summary New industries often serve multiple customer segments, each with different preferences. Entrants can either launch products catering to the specific preferences of customers in a small number of segments or launch products targeting numerous segments. Evidence from the U.S commercial drone industry shows that when entrants have experience in one of the customer segments adopting the new industry's product, they tend to introduce products targeting fewer segments. By recognizing the impact of prior experiences on product portfolio development, entrepreneurial leaders gain insights to assess whether their cognitive alignment with a customer segment has restricted their broader exploration of the demand environment, or whether their superior demand knowledge about a customer segment has created a competitive advantage.",Crossref,86.89655172413794,10.1002/smj.3407,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3407,Goal 12,0.01932783667038718,False,

Immigrant Entrepreneurship: The Effect of Early Career Immigration Constraints on New Venture FormationOrganization Science,"Agarwal, R. & Ganco, M. & Raffiee, J",2022,,"We examine how institutional factors may affect microlevel career decisions by individuals to create new firms by impacting their ability to exercise entrepreneurial preferences, their accumulation of human capital, and the opportunity costs associated with new venture formation. We focus on an important institutional factor—immigration-related work constraints—given that technologically intensive firms in the United States not only draw upon immigrants as knowledge workers but also because such firms are disproportionately founded by immigrants. We examine the implications of these constraints using the National Science Foundation’s Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System, which tracks the careers of science and engineering graduates from U.S. universities. Relative to natives, we theorize and show that immigration-related work constraints in the United States suppress entrepreneurship as an early career choice of immigrants by restricting labor market options to paid employment jobs in organizational contexts tightly matched with the immigrant’s educational training (job-education match). Work experience in paid employment job-education match is associated with the accumulation of specialized human capital and increased opportunity costs associated with new venture formation. Consistent with immigration-related work constraints inhibiting individuals with entrepreneurial preferences from engaging in entrepreneurship, we show that when the immigration-related work constraints are released, immigrants in job-education match are more likely than comparable natives to found incorporated employer firms.

In Customer Portfolio Management, Fred Selnes and Michael Johnson argue that for most companies and organizations the larger leaky bucket is more valuable. While loyal customers are generally more profitable, the weaker, or “leaky,” relationships in a portfolio provide scale economies and a source of future loyal customers. The basic principle behind customer portfolio management (CPM), they explain, is to view a company's market strategies as long-term investments in the strength of relationships over an entire portfolio of current and future customers. This book helps business leaders understand when and how much to focus on acquiring customers, how to defend and leverage those relationships, and how to convert some of these relationships into stronger, more profitable ones. The authors present an implementable framework for CPM that involves: • segmenting customers into strangers, acquaintances, friends and partners; • understanding the lifetime value, or revenues and costs over time, across relationship segments; and • determining when and how much to invest in customer acquisition, relationship defense, relationship leverage, and relationship conversion.

Seeing Is Believing? How Including a Video in Fake News Influences User Reporting of Fake News to Social Media PlatformsMIS Quarterly,"Wang, S. & Pang, M. & Pavlou, P",2022,,"Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, are combating the spread of fake news by developing systems that allow their users to report fake news. However, it remains unclear whether these reporting systems that harness the “wisdom of the crowd” are effective. Notably, concerns have been raised that the popularity of videos may hamper users’ reporting of fake news. The persuasive power of videos may render fake news more deceptive and less likely to be reported in practice. However, this is neither theoretically nor empirically straightforward, as videos not only affect users’ ability to detect fake news, but also impact their willingness to report and their engagement (i.e., likes, shares, and comments) which would further spread fake news. Using a unique dataset from a leading social media platform, we empirically examine how including a video in a fake news post affects the number of users reporting the post to the platform. Our results indicate that including a video significantly increases the number of users reporting the fake news post to the social media platform. Additionally, we find that the sentiment intensity of the fake news text content, especially when the sentiment is positive, attenuates the effect of including a video. Randomized experiments and a set of mediation analyses are included to uncover the underlying mechanisms. We contribute to the information systems literature by examining how social media platforms can leverage their users to report fake news, and how different formats (e.g., videos and text) of fake news interact to influence users’ reporting behavior.

Against this backdrop of diverging views, the authors investigate the impact of different GMO labeling policy regimes on the products consumers choose. Guided by the literature on negativity bias, structural alignment theory, and message presentation, and based on findings from four experiments, the authors show that consumer demand for GM foods depends on the labeling regime policy makers adopt. Both absence-focused (“non-GMO”) and presence-focused (“contains GMO”) labeling regimes reduce the market share of GM foods, with the reduction being greater in the latter case. GMO labels reduce the importance consumers place on price and enhance their willingness to pay for non-GM products. Results indicate that specific label design choices policy makers implement (in the form of color and style) also affect consumer responses to GM labeling.

Recent meta-analytic research reveals the average economic impact of market share performance and identifies some factors affecting its value. However, empirical understanding of why any market share–profit relationship exists and varies is limited. The authors simultaneously examine the three primary theoretical mechanisms linking firm market share with profit. On average, they find that most of the variance in market share’s positive effect on firm profit is explained by market power and quality signaling, with little support for operating efficiency as a mechanism. They find a similar explanatory role of the three mechanisms in conditions where market share negatively predicts profit (for niche firms and those “buying” market share). Using these mechanism insights, the authors show that the value of market share differs in predictable ways between firms and across industries, providing new understanding of when managers may usefully set market share goals. The authors also provide new insights into how market share should be measured for goal setting and performance monitoring.

Methodology: We develop a game-theoretic model in which an innovative company collects monopoly profits for a patented pharmaceutical but faces competition from a generic rival after the patent expires. A social-welfare-maximizing regulator is the Stackelberg leader. The regulator leads by offering a patent extension to the innovative company while also imposing take-back regulation on the pharmaceutical industry. Then the two-profit maximizing companies respond by setting drug prices and choosing whether to invest in green pharmacy. Results: The regulator’s optimal patent extension offer can induce green pharmacy but only if the offer exceeds a threshold length that depends on the degree of product differentiation present in the pharmaceutical industry. The regulator’s correspondingly optimal take-back regulation generally prescribes a required collection rate that decreases as its optimal patent extension offer increases, and vice versa. Managerial implications: By isolating green pharmacy as a potential target to address pharmaceutical eco-toxicity at its source, the regulatory policy that we consider, which combines the incentive inherent in earning a patent extension on the one hand with the penalty inherent in complying with take-back regulation on the other hand, serves as a useful starting point for policymakers to optimally balance economic welfare considerations with environmental stewardship considerations.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),93.5251798561151,,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2021.1009,Goal 12,0.01933531619580799,False,

The Rise of New Technologies in Marketing: A Framework and OutlookJournal of Marketing,"Hoffman, D. & Moreau, P. & Stremersch, S. & Wedel, M",2022,,"As a scholarly field, marketing has a long tradition of studying the adoption of new technologies. This attention is certainly warranted, as studies consistently demonstrate that, compared with firms that do not invest heavily in new technology, those that do are more agile and enjoy a strong competitive advantage (IBM Institute for Business Value 2021). However, what has received less attention in the literature is how new technologies give rise to innovations in marketing techniques, tools, and strategies themselves. In particular, there is a need for marketing scholars to develop theoretical paradigms of how marketers use technologies to develop a competitive advantage. This special issue on “New Technologies in Marketing” presents cutting-edge scholarly research that recognizes the foundational role of new technologies in driving marketing theory and practice. The articles in the special issue study a broad range of new technologies, and we hope they will stimulate further research concerning new technologies in marketing and their application in practice. In this editorial, we provide several frameworks for thinking about how new technology affects the marketing discipline.

Modeling multivariate time series with copula-linked univariate D-vinesJournal of Business and Economic Statistics,"Zhao, Z. & Shi, P. & Zhang, Z",2022,,"This article proposes a novel multivariate time series model named copula-linked univariate D-vines (CuDvine), which enables the simultaneous copula-based modeling of both temporal and cross-sectional dependence for multivariate time series. To construct CuDvine, we first build a semiparametric univariate D-vine time series model (uDvine) based on a D-vine. The uDvine generalizes the existing first-order copula-based Markov chain models to Markov chains of an arbitrary-order. Building upon uDvine, we construct CuDvine by linking multiple uDvines via a parametric copula. As a simple and tractable model, CuDvine provides flexible models for marginal behavior and temporal dependence of time series, and can also incorporate sophisticated cross-sectional dependence such as time-varying and spatio-temporal dependence for high-dimensional applications. Robust and computationally efficient procedures, including a sequential model selection method and a two-stage MLE, are proposed for model estimation and inference, and their statistical properties are investigated. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the flexibility of CuDvine, and to examine the performance of the sequential model selection procedure and the two-stage MLE.

Copula regression for compound distributions with endogenous covariates with applications in insurance deductible pricingJournal of the American Statistical Association,"Shi, P. & Lee, G",2022,,"This article concerns deductible pricing in nonlife insurance contracts. The primary interest of insurers is the effect of the contract deductible on a policyholder’s aggregate loss that is determined by a compound distribution where the sum of individual claim amount is stopped by the number of claims. Policyholders choose the deductible level based on their hidden risks, which makes deductible endogenous in the regressions for both claim frequency and claim severity. To address the endogeneity in the regression for the compound aggregate loss, we introduce a novel approach using pair copula constructions to jointly model the policyholder’s deductible, number of claims, and individual claim amounts, in the context of compound distributions. The proposed method provides insurers an empirical tool to uncover the underlying risk distribution of the potential customers.
In the application we consider an insurance portfolio from the property insurance program that provides property coverage for building and contents of local government entities of the Wisconsin. Using the historical data on policyholder and insurance claims, we first provide empirical evidence of the endogeneity of the deductible. Interestingly, we find that the policyholder’s deductible is negatively associated with the claim frequency but positively associated with the claim severity. For the portfolio of policyholders, the endogenous deductible model provides superior prediction for 65% and 71% of policyholders for claim frequency and severity, respectively. The endogeneity of deductible shows significant managerial implications on insurance operations. In particular, the risk score suggested by the proposed method allows the insurer to identify additional profitable underwriting strategies which are quantified by the Gini indices of 0.22 and 0.13 when switching from the exogenous deductible premium and the insurer’s contract premium, respectively.

"Deregulation, competition, and consumer choice of insurer: Evidence from liberalization reform in China’s automobile insurance marketGeneva Risk and Insurance Review","Zheng, W. & Yao, Y. & Shi, P. & Deng, Y. & Zheng, H",2022,,"In 2015, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission initiated a liberalization reform in the automobile insurance industry to grant insurers more discretion in policy design, underwriting, and ratemaking. The deregulation intended to increase competition and choices for the consumer, yet there was little scientific evidence on how the insurance market responded to the reform. This article examines the effectiveness of this deregulation reform in China. Leveraging a large industry dataset of more than 7 million automobile insurance policies from 63 major automobile insurers operating in China, we study policyholders’ switching behavior among insurance providers. To better understand the heterogeneity in the impact of deregulation on market performance and consumer choice, we further analyze the switching pattern among different types of insurers according to the insurer's size, the company’s business structure, the jurisdiction’s market power, and the customer’s risk type. Overall, the empirical results suggest that the reform has met its original goal, leading to higher market competition, and more diversified consumer choices. We further confirm that the average premium dropped significantly after the reform for all three jurisdictions implementing the reform, yet the insurers’ pricing strategy was risk type dependent, i.e., the average premium for the high-risk customers increased, while the average premium for the low-risk customers decreased substantially.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),94.02390438247012,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s10713-021-00067-2,Goal 12,0.021089743031295,False,

Talking with strangers is surprisingly informativeProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Atir, S. & Wald, K. & Epley, N",2022,,"A meaningful amount of people’s knowledge comes from their conversations with others.

Participants who were asked to talk with another person expected to learn significantly less from the conversation than they actually reported learning afterward, regardless of whether they had conversation prompts and whether they had the goal to learn (experiments 1 and 2). Undervaluing conversation does not stem from having systematically poor opinions of how much others know (experiment 3) but is instead related to the inherent uncertainty involved in conversation itself. Consequently, people underestimate learning to a lesser extent when uncertainty is reduced, as in a nonsocial context (surfing the web, experiment 4); when talking to an acquainted conversation partner (experiment 5); and after knowing the content of the conversation (experiment 6).

Sustainability in the Fast Fashion IndustryManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Long, X. & Nasiry, J",2022,,"Problem definition: A fast fashion system allows firms to react quickly to changing consumer demand by replenishing inventory (via quick response) and introducing more fashion styles. In this paper, we study the environmental impact of the fast fashion business model by analyzing its implications for product quality, variety, and inventory decisions. Relevance: Our work establishes a much-needed understanding of the link between the fast fashion business model and its environmental consequences. Methodology: We consider a two-period model in which a firm sells to fashion-sensitive consumers whose preferences are influenced by a random fashion trend. We analyze the effect of fast fashion capabilities (quick response and design flexibility) on the firm’s quality decision, leftover inventory and total environmental impact. Results: We find that a key driver of low product quality in the fast fashion industry is the firm’s incentive to offer variety to hedge against uncertain fashion trends. When variety is endogenous, quality decreases as consumers become more sensitive to fashion or as the cost of introducing new styles decreases. We identify the conditions under which increasing fast fashion capabilities leads to higher environmental impact. Managerial implications: We assess the effectiveness of three environmental initiatives (waste disposal regulations, consumer education, and production tax schemes) in countering the environmental impact of fast fashion. We show that waste disposal policies and production taxes are effective in reducing the firm’s leftover inventory—but may have the unintended consequence of lowering product quality, which may worsen the firm’s environmental impact.

The Influence of Status on Evaluations: Evidence from Online Coding ContestsMIS Quarterly,"Deodhar, S. & Babar, Y. & Burtch, G",2022,,"In many instances, online contest platforms rely on contestants to ensure submission quality. This scalable evaluation mechanism offers a collective benefit. However, contestants may also leverage it to achieve personal, competitive benefits. Our study examines this tension from a status-theoretic perspective, suggesting that the conflict between competitive and collective benefits, and the net implication for evaluation efficacy, is influenced by contestants’ status. On the one hand, contestants of lower status may be viewed as less skilled and hence more likely to make mistakes. Therefore, low-status contestants may attract more evaluations if said evaluations are driven predominantly by an interest in collective benefits. On the other hand, if evaluations are driven largely by an interest in personal, competitive benefits, a low-status contestant makes for a less attractive target and hence may attract fewer evaluations. We empirically test these competing possibilities using a dataset of coding contests from Codeforces. The platform allows contestants to assess others’ submissions and improve evaluations (a collective benefit) by devising test cases (hacks) in addition to those defined by the contest organizer. If a submission is successfully hacked, the hacker earns additional points, and the target submission is eliminated from the contest (a competitive benefit). We begin by providing qualitative evidence based on semi-structured interviews conducted with contestants spanning the status spectrum at Codeforces. Next, we present quantitative evidence exploiting a structural change at Codeforces wherein many contestants experienced an arbitrary status reduction unrelated to their performance because of sudden changes to the platform’s color-coding system around contestant ratings. We show that status-loser contestants received systematically more evaluations from other contestants, absent changes in their short-run submission quality. Finally, we show that the excess evaluations allocated toward affected contestants were less effective, indicating status-driven evaluations as potentially less efficacious.

Our difference-in-differences analysis shows that compared with homeowners without mortgage obligations, mortgage borrowers increased their monthly credit card spending by 8.7% after the 230-bps mortgage rate reduction announced in September 2008. We find a significant spending response both immediately after the announcement and during the post-reset period. The credit card delinquency rate also decreased after the mortgage rate reset. Subsequent to an interest-rate increase episode, mortgage borrowers symmetrically reduced their credit card spending. Hand-to-mouth mortgage borrowers experienced a more pronounced spending increase.

Does Spatial Misallocation in China’s Housing and Land Markets Drive Up Housing Prices?VoxChina,"Deng, Y. & Tang, Y. & Wang, P. & Wu, J",2022,,"Housing and land prices in China have experienced dramatic growth in the past decade. In conjunction with the rapid growth, housing and land price dispersion across Chinese cities have also become more dispersed. This paper intends to explore how market frictions affect the aggregate as well as the spatial distribution of prices. We first document the spatial variations of housing and land market frictions. Larger cities receive less housing and land subsidizes. Land frictions are improving over time. We then embed both frictions into a dynamic competitive spatial equilibrium framework featured with endogenous rural-urban migration. The calibrated model can reasonably mimic the price growth in the data. The counter-factual results suggest that the frictionless economy leads to a slower housing price growth but faster land price growth. In addition, land frictions tend to inhibit land price growth while housing price growth will slow down if only housing frictions are eliminated.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),92.45283018867924,10.3386/w27230,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/407953eb0c09f969ab3cd79cabf9d2be03db8fd4,Goal 11,0.08028418624193877,True,urban expansion; urban growth rates; urban inequality
To Accept or Not to Accept: Optimal Strategy for Sellers in Real EstateReal Estate Economics,"Emmerling, T. & Yavas, A. & Yildirim, Y",2021,,Abstract We consider the problem of a seller who faces an unknown number of offers where each offer is a random draw from a known distribution. The objective of the seller is to maximize the probability that the highest offer is chosen. We show that the optimal strategy is characterized by a nonincreasing stochastic set of reservation prices. We also provide numerical analysis to calibrate the model and provide support to the observation that first offers in residential real estate markets tend to be higher than subsequent offers. The model's prediction closely matches the empirical findings of Merlo and Ortalo‐Magné that more than 70% of the properties sell to the buyer who makes the first offer.,Crossref,79.75460122699387,10.1111/1540-6229.12318,https://doi.org/10.1111/1540-6229.12318,Goal 2,0.003320639068259231,False,

A Simulation-based Approach to Business Model Design and Organizational Change,"Bock, A. & George, G. & Warglien, M",2021,,"ABSTRACT While several practice-based approaches of business model design suggest ways to create new business models, there is limited understanding of why and how business models change. This exploratory study employs neural network analysis to simulate business model design and business model change. We conceptualise business model design as a schema of the organisation’s critical resources, transactions, and value proposition. Elements of the schema are connected in a simple neural network. The network evolves based on a constraint satisfaction network until it converges to a stable state of a coherent business model. An in-depth case study of an entrepreneurial venture provides a real-world example to test the analytical framework. Using data from the case study, we run multiple simulations of business model design and business model change. The results suggest that business model change can be understood as a form of constraint satisfaction, linking managerial cognition with business model change. The simulation approach also helps identify possible, but unrealized business models. This novel approach paves the way for new research and practice in business model design and change.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),92.3076923076923,10.1080/14479338.2020.1769482,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f7fa49e0d79ced0ef3ff0fe3c6165bc3002df30,Goal 12,0.01237132053628134,False,

Peer Effects in Competitive Environments: Field Experiments on Information Provision and InterventionsMIS Quarterly,"Li, Z. & Wang, H. & Wang, G",2021,,"Prior studies of social-norms interventions have focused on nudging behavior in noncompetitive settings. This research evaluates such interventions in competitive environments, for example, a class with a competitive grading policy. Field experiments on a learning management system show that providing descriptive information about peers’ behavior has mixed effects in reducing procrastination and improving performance outcomes. Specifically, the effects are moderated by individual characteristics and contextual variables. First, peer information interventions are more effective for males, and the effects are stronger in a male-majority environment than in a female-majority environment. These findings differ from prior studies of social-norms interventions conducted in noncompetitive settings, in which females are found to be more responsive to interventions. Gender differences in our competitive settings can be explained by males’ and females’ differential preferences for competition: males are more competitive-oriented and thus are more responsive to peer information in competitive environments. Second, we find that individuals who are in great need of interventions, that is, those with poor past behavior and performance, are also more likely to benefit from peer information interventions, suggesting that peer information interventions motivate positive change. This study highlights the heterogeneous effects of peer information interventions and has implications for targeted interventions.",Crossref,94.00921658986175,10.25300/misq/2021/16085,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2021/16085,Goal 5,0.02359665500635985,False,gender bias

Improving the adoption of household health products: A sales experiment with chlorine tabletsHealth Economics,"Boudot-Reddy, C. & Mukherjee, A",2021,,"Abstract We test a door‐to‐door marketing intervention aimed to increase use of a targeted health product among poor households. Specifically, we examine three treatments in which this good–chlorine tablets for drinking water purification–is: (1) sold alone, (2) sold alongside a familiar and cheaper side good that is priced at its retail value, and (3) sold alongside the same side good that is priced on a promotional offer. The side good when sold at retail price is intended to be an “opt‐out” good to reduce the marketing pressure, which should in turn reduce the amount of products sold that go unused. When the side good is sold on promotion, however, we hypothesize that it reintroduces marketing pressure due to the “gift” aspect of the promotion. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that chlorine use is nearly double in the second condition compared to the other two conditions. Our results suggest that household valuation of a new product is shaped by both the presence and the price of a side good due to marketing pressure.",Crossref,95.50561797752809,10.1002/hec.4207,https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4207,Goal 6,0.05535135882291003,True,affordable drinking water

The paradoxical effect of prior operating experience and observational learning on new market entryIndustrial and Corporate Change,"Terlaak, A. & Kim, J",2021,,"Abstract We study how prior operating experience interacts with observational learning to exert paradoxical effects on market entry. When a new market disrupts a firm’s standing routines, greater operating experience with these routines complicates adaptation and increases the firm’s uncertainty about the feasibility of entering, thereby delaying its entry. Yet, this entry uncertainty simultaneously prompts the firm to rely more heavily on learning from the observation of others entering which, in turn, hastens its entry. Patterns are opposite for firms that can leverage their standing routines into the new market. Here, greater operating experience and resultant momentum to extrapolate existing routines reduce a firm’s uncertainty about the feasibility of entry. This directly accelerates their entry but also diminishes the indirect, accelerating influence of observational learning. Because of these opposite dynamics, entry rates between firms with these different types of prior operating experience begin to diminish. Empirical analysis of entry patterns into the deregulation-created electric power trading market supports our theory and calls for modifications to previous expectations of prior operating experience exerting either a purely delaying or accelerating effect on entry, and, further, draws attention to the indirect pathways through which prior experience shapes entry patterns.",Crossref,96.875,10.1093/icc/dtab020,https://doi.org/10.1093/icc/dtab020,Goal 4,0.009598410249311495,False,

Yet a signaling conflict can arise when a firm belongs to an organizational form that has a collective reputation for being unethical. In such circumstances, the firm's environmental performance may no longer credibly signal its underlying integrity capacity, leading markets to adjust downward the value they would otherwise place on the firm's environmental performance. Using longitudinal data on South Korean firms, we find that improvements in firm environmental performance lead to smaller increases in market values for firms belonging to a poorly reputed organizational form. However, firms can partially recover lost value by adopting firm features that reduce the signaling conflict, thereby restoring the notion of corporate sustainability performance driving firm market values.",Crossref,85.79710144927536,10.1002/bse.2702,https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2702,Goal 12,0.05744242508675976,True,corporate sustainability

The Impact of Facility Layout on Service Worker Behavior: An Empirical Study of Nurses in the Emergency DepartmentManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Meng, L. & Batt, R. & Terwiesch, C",2021,,"Problem definition: We study the impact of service facility layout on how service workers organize their tasks. We focus on the hospital emergency department (ED) as a service setting in which nurses (servers) have discretion over how they interact with patients (customers) in a facility that introduces significant heterogeneity in necessary walking distance. Academic/practical relevance: Prior studies on facility layout in operations have largely focused on the direct effect of transit times on reduced productivity. We extend this work to show how skilled service workers such as nurses adapt their work behavior to enhance their productivity in response to facility layout constraints. Methodology: To study this empirically, we utilize a unique data set consisting of infrared nurse location tracking data, patient electronic medical record data, bedside patient call data, and the architectural floor plan of a large academic ED. Results: Nurses working in a busy ED appear to reduce their walking distance by batching their tasks to distant patient rooms. Although the patients in these rooms receive the same amount of care time, this behavior results in longer wait times between nurse visits and more nurse call button activations, but it does not compromise the overall quality of care delivered. Nurse call button use is linked with poor patient satisfaction and interrupts nurse workflow. Managerial implications: These findings show that even in services, facility layout can lead to servers using task timing discretion in ways that help the server but lead to a additional waiting time for the customer.

We posit that these two important contextual factors influence managers' audit quality preferences. We study these factors because they are ubiquitous to companies, and we focus on their influence on managers because managers continue to play a significant role in the auditor hiring process and we know relatively little about their auditor preferences. We predict that risk, the potential for loss, and their interaction will each decrease manager demand for high audit quality due to a desire to achieve greater reporting flexibility. Experimental results are consistent with our predictions; specifically, increased risk, the potential for loss, and to a lesser extent their interaction, significantly reduce managers' likelihood of hiring the best available auditor in the market. Path analysis indicates that this reduction in audit quality demand leads to increases in misreporting. Finally, we observe investors overpaying for assets to a greater extent when managers hire lower‐quality auditors. Our results show that the contextual factors of risk and the potential for loss, which are ubiquitous to companies, can reduce demand for audit quality, which can increase misreporting behavior and ultimately harm investors.",Crossref,86.52482269503545,10.1111/1911-3846.12682,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12682,Goal 1,0.01156614931212777,False,

This paper serves as a tribute to the beauty of these “little ideas” and demonstrates how they can be recombined to generate novel implications. In particular, we focus on the example of an inverted V-shaped performance association centering around the year when executives were featured in a prominent listing, Barron’s annual list of Top 30 chief executive officers. Our recombination of several chance models developed by March and his coauthors provides a novel explanation for why many of the executives’ exceptional performances did not persist. In contrast to the common accounts of complacency, hubris, and statistical regression, the results show that declines from high performance may result from the way luck interacts with these executives’ slow adaptation, incompetence, and self-reinforced risk taking. We conclude by elaborating on the normative implications of chance models, which address many current management and societal challenges.

Internal Information Quality and State Tax PlanningContemporary Accounting Research,"Laplante, S. & Lynch, D. & Vernon (Bull), M",2021,,"ABSTRACT This study examines the association between internal information quality and state tax planning. Prior literature documents a positive association between internal information quality and summary measures of tax avoidance. However, we know little about specific forms of tax planning and internal information quality. State tax planning is difficult because of the number of jurisdictions, variety of tax rules, variation of enforcement, and apportionment requirements. We find that internal information quality facilitates state tax planning and is most important when firms face more restrictive state tax laws and when domestic firms relative to multinational firms have international income shifting opportunities. Our results provide a baseline of the economic effects of internal information quality on different forms of tax planning. Understanding internal information quality's role in state tax planning is especially relevant as countries propose to modify international tax rules to mirror the state taxation format of a single‐entity system with apportionment.",Crossref,89.36170212765957,10.1111/1911-3846.12714,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12714,Goal 17,0.022161255211115,False,

The RCs program was defunded unexpectedly for coverage year 2016, before its legislated end in 2016.

Improving Complex Audit Judgments: A Framework and EvidenceContemporary Accounting Research,"Griffith, E. & Kadous, K. & Young, D",2021,,"ABSTRACT Regulators and researchers provide evidence that auditors' judgment quality is problematic in complex audit tasks. We introduce a framework for improving auditor judgment in these tasks. The framework builds on dual‐process theory to recognize that high‐quality judgment in complex tasks requires that auditors (i) possess the knowledge needed for the task, (ii) recognize the need for analytical (versus heuristic) processing, and (iii) have sufficient cognitive capacity to complete the analytical processing. Based on the framework, we predict that auditors' need for cognition (NFC), a characteristic theoretically linked to recognizing the need for analytical processing, is associated with higher quality complex judgments. Analysis of 11 studies supports this assertion. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by predicting and finding that priming auditors with an accuracy goal improves judgments, particularly for lower NFC auditors, who are less likely to spontaneously engage in analytical processing. The framework facilitates systematic development of interventions to improve auditor judgment by highlighting that solutions should address the specific conditions causing judgment problems.",Crossref,90.09009009009009,10.1111/1911-3846.12658,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12658,Goal 17,0.01556315084650659,False,

We study the effectiveness of reminders in the context of EE tasks in manufacturing facilities. Technical assistance programs make EE recommendations to participating manufacturing sites and remind them regularly to pay attention to implementation. Our analysis shows that these reminders lead to a more widespread implementation of EE improvement suggestions and are particularly useful when facilities undertake multiple EE tasks in parallel, or when other unrelated sustainability tasks are being pursued in parallel. Next, we conduct a field study by leveraging a policy intervention called “Touchbase Tuesdays” that was implemented by our partner organization based on the results from our analysis.

Inventory Sharing and Demand-Side UnderweightingManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Zhao, H. & Xu, L. & Siemsen, E",2021,,"Problem definition : Transshipment/inventory sharing has been used in practice because of its risk-pooling potential. However, human decision makers play a critical role in making inventory decisions in an inventory sharing system, which may affect its benefits. We investigate whether the opportunity to transship inventory influences decision makers’ inventory decisions and whether, as a result, the intended risk-pooling benefits materialize. Academic/practical relevance : Previous research in transshipment, which is focused on finding optimal stocking and sharing decisions, assumes rational decision making without any systematic bias. As one of the first to study inventory sharing from a behavioral perspective, we demonstrate a persistent stocking-decision bias relevant for inventory sharing systems. Methodology : We develop a behavioral model of a multilocation inventory system with transshipments. Using four behavioral studies, we identify, test, estimate, and mitigate a demand-side underweighting bias: although inventory sharing brings both a supply-side benefit and a demand-side benefit, players underestimate the latter. We show analytically that such bias leads to underordering. We also explore whether reframing the inventory sharing decision reduces this bias. Results : Our results show that subjects persistently reduce their order quantities when transshipments are allowed. This underordering, which persists even when a decision-support system suggests optimal quantities, causes insufficient inventory in the system, in turn reducing the risk-pooling benefits of inventory sharing. Underordering is evidently caused by an underweighting bias; although players correctly estimate the supply-side potential from transshipment, they only estimate 20% of the demand-side potential. Managerial implications : Although inventory sharing can profitably reduce inventory, too much underordering undermines its intended risk-pooling benefits. The demand-side benefits of transshipment need to be emphasized when implementing inventory sharing systems.",Crossref,81.48148148148148,10.1287/msom.2020.0875,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2020.0875,Goal 5,0.01438163182260299,False,

Recovering from Critical Incidents: Evidence from Paramedic PerformanceManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Bavafa, H. & Jónasson, J",2021,,"Problem definition: In service operations settings where the difficulty of jobs is unpredictable, workers can encounter critical incidents (CIs)—jobs that are sufficiently disturbing to challenge workers’ coping mechanisms. We examine the impact of encountering CIs on subsequent operational performance of workers. Academic/practical relevance: Prior work has examined the effects of CIs on the long-term psychological health of workers. We demonstrate that encountering CIs has a practically meaningful impact on operational performance. We also examine the time-dependency and process-dependency of the effect and analyze whether it is mitigated by individual characteristics such as age or experience. Methodology: We use data on 902,002 ambulance activations conducted by paramedics at the London Ambulance Service (LAS). We define CIs as incidents where patients have a high probability of dying at the scene and examine the impact of such events on the paramedics’ performance for the remainder of their shifts. Our outcomes are the completion time of the ambulance activation and each of its five subprocesses. The exogenous assignment of CIs to paramedic crews allows a clean identification of our effect using a shift-level difference-in-differences specification. Results: Crews who have encountered one prior CI (two prior CIs) spend on average 2.6% (7.5%) more time completing each remaining ambulance activation in the shift. The impact is strongest for the jobs immediately following a CI but persists throughout the shift. The largest effects come from the subprocesses that are least standardized and where paramedics cannot rely on standard operating procedures. The duration effect is larger for teams of older paramedics but is simultaneously mitigated by experience.

The Variance Learning CurveManagement Science,"Bavafa, H. & Jónasson, J",2021,,"The expansive learning curve literature in operations management has established how various facets of prior experience improve average performance.

Similar to prior results on the average learning curve, we find a diminishing impact of additional experience on the variance learning curve. We provide an evidence base for how to model the learning benefits of cumulative experience on performance in service systems. Our findings imply that the benefits of learning are substantially underestimated if the consistency effect is ignored. Specifically, our estimates indicate that queue lengths (or wait times) might be overestimated by as much as 4% by ignoring the impact of the variance learning curve in service systems.

In the model, precautionary saving is achieved by lowering utilization, instead of increasing investment. Lower utilization persistently decreases depreciation, conserving capital for the future, and simultaneously discourages new investment.

Caring for the Commons: Using Psychological Ownership to Enhance Stewardship Behavior for Public GoodsJournal of Marketing,"Peck, J. & Kirk, C. & Luangrath, A. & Shu, S",2021,,"How can consumers be encouraged to take better care of public goods? Across four studies, including two experiments in the field and three documenting actual behaviors, the authors demonstrate that increasing consumers’ individual psychological ownership facilitates stewardship of public goods. This effect occurs because feelings of ownership increase consumers’ perceived responsibility, which then leads to active behavior to care for the good. Evidence from a variety of contexts, including a public lake with kayakers, a state park with skiers, and a public walking path, suggests that increasing psychological ownership enhances both effortful stewardship, such as picking up trash from a lake, and financial stewardship, such as donating money. This work further demonstrates that the relationship between psychological ownership and resulting stewardship behavior is attenuated when there are cues, such as an attendance sign, which diffuse responsibility among many people. This work offers implications for consumers, practitioners, and policy makers with simple interventions that can encourage consumers to be better stewards of public goods.",Crossref,96.84210526315789,10.1177/0022242920952084,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022242920952084,Goal 11,0.01629822517967222,False,
Eliciting human judgment for prediction algorithmsManagement Science,"Ibrahim, R. & Kim, S. & Tong, J",2021,,"Even when human point forecasts are less accurate than data-based algorithm predictions, they can still help boost performance by being used as algorithm inputs. Assuming one uses human judgment indirectly in this manner, we propose changing the elicitation question from the traditional direct forecast (DF) to what we call the private information adjustment (PIA): how much the human thinks the algorithm should adjust its forecast to account for information the human has that is unused by the algorithm. Using stylized models with and without random error, we theoretically prove that human random error makes eliciting the PIA lead to more accurate predictions than eliciting the DF. However, this DF-PIA gap does not exist for perfectly consistent forecasters. The DF-PIA gap is increasing in the random error that people make while incorporating public information (data that the algorithm uses) but is decreasing in the random error that people make while incorporating private information (data that only the human can use). In controlled experiments with students and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, we find support for these hypotheses.

Trying and Failing: Biases in Donor Aversion to RejectionProduction and Operations Management,"Daniels, K. & Valdes, L",2021,,"Non‐profit organizations (NPOs) play a critical role in advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, directing resources from donors to aid recipients. To achieve this, they often rely on donations of physical goods, which can not only further the mission of the NPO, but also give new life to used goods destined for the landfill. However, not all donations are wanted or needed—the NPO may be space constrained or the donation may be of poor quality. Accepting unwanted donations imposes non‐trivial operational costs on the NPO or its downstream partners. Nonetheless, NPOs often hesitate to reject unwanted items, fearing negative repercussions for future donations. To better understand these repercussions, we study how donors respond to rejection using a controlled experiment. Subjects repeatedly choose whether to complete a real‐effort task that generates a donation, which is rejected with a fixed probability whose value is unknown to them. We measure subjects’ donation decisions and beliefs about the probability that their donations are accepted. We compare these measures against a for‐profit experimental condition wherein the subject, not an NPO, receives the payment generated by the real‐effort task. Our results identify a mechanism by which rejections affect donations: via a reduction in donors’ beliefs about future success. Moreover, we identify a novel instance of self‐serving bias: when high effort is required to make a donation, subjects’ beliefs respond significantly more negatively to rejection in the donation condition than in the for‐profit condition. We propose ways in which NPOs can alleviate this bias.",Crossref,90.38461538461539,10.1111/poms.13537,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13537,Goal 12,0.03107544239887354,False,

Increasing Team Performance by Sharing SuccessJournal of Marketing Research,"Chen, H. & Chung, K",2021,,"When using group-based commission plans to motivate their sales force, should firms always compensate salespeople based on the average of team members’ sales outcomes? The theory suggests that when team members are heterogeneous in sales abilities, the proposed maximum contract (where the team output is set by the largest individual sales output) dominates the average contract (where the team output is determined by the average output of team members) in terms of overall team effort. This is because the stronger team member will exert higher effort under the maximum contract compared with the average contract, and this increase exceeds the decrease in the weaker team member’s effort. The authors validate the theoretical predictions by employing two laboratory experiments to provide a causal test of the theory and two randomized field experiments to deliver additional corroborating evidence. Overall, the experimental results are consistent and broadly confirm the theoretical predictions, pointing to the substantial gains from implementing the maximum contract when team members are heterogeneous in abilities. Interestingly, the weaker team members exert similar effort across the maximum and average contracts, although the theory predicts higher effort under the latter.",Crossref,90.47619047619048,10.1177/00222437211021835,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211021835,Goal 4,0.002419879388112983,False,

Gender Gaps in Equity Crowdfunding: Evidence from a Randomized Field ExperimentManagement Science,"Bapna, S. & Ganco, M",2021,,"Although prior research in traditional equity financing shows that male founders are preferred, emerging evidence in low-stakes crowdfunding (e.g., rewards-based crowdfunding) indicates that female entrepreneurs may have an advantage, particularly with female investors. We seek to examine whether investors in high-stakes equity crowdfunding, which includes elements from both traditional equity financing and low-stakes crowdfunding, respond differently to male and female founders. Specifically, we examine whether founder gender preferences, if they exist, vary based on the gender and the experience of the investor. Through a randomized field experiment, we find that inexperienced female investors are significantly more interested (138%) in ventures with female founders than those with male founders; however, we do not observe founder gender preferences among experienced female investors. For male investors, we do not observe differences in interest based on founder gender or investor experience. Thus, we confirm that the gender gaps observed in traditional equity financing are ameliorated in the equity crowdfunding context. Furthermore, we identify a boundary condition to the preference for female founders reported in earlier work involving low-stakes crowdfunding. In high-stakes crowdfunding, investor experience serves as a contingency that reduces female investors’ preference for female founders, potentially because of the weakening effects of activism homophily and the lower reliance on heuristics as investor experience increases.

Cure or Poison? Identity Verification and the Posting of Fake News on Social MediaJournal of Management Information Systems,"Wang, S. & Pang, M. & Pavlou, P",2021,,"ABSTRACT The proliferation of fake news on social media has become a major societal and political problem. Meanwhile, social media platforms have started to require identity verification from users and label the verified users with a verification badge, making users more responsible for their online behavior. In this study, we empirically investigate two research questions: 1) What is the impact of identity verification on users’ propensity to post fake news? and 2) How does a verification badge moderate the impact of identity verification? Results suggest that while identity verification without a verification badge has a negative impact on users’ posting of fake news, this impact is significantly weakened when users are granted a verification badge after identity verification. Given the criticisms on identity verification policies, these findings underscore both the potential upsides and risks for social media platforms seeking to combat fake news through identity verification techniques.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),96.20253164556962,10.1080/07421222.2021.1990615,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d95e0ff161566b1c9b47a4687090408fe0b83076,Goal 1,0.0206098949838703,False,

Do You Have a Room for Us in Your IT? An Economic Analysis of Shared IT Services and Implications for ITMIS Quarterly,"Chen, M. & Pang, M. & Kumar, S",2021,,"We are witnessing an interesting and unique phenomenon in enterprise information technology (IT) adoption and management in public-sector organizations: shared IT services. Instead of implementing separate IT services, governments come together to pool their IT resources into one single IT service. In this study, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze the governments’ decision to share IT services and understand how the introduction of shared services transforms the strategic interactions between the governments and the vendor. We study three common regimes used in the adoption of shared IT services: (1) a cost-sharing regime where costs are split proportionally, (2) a profit-center regime where one government charges a surplus-maximization price to the other, and (3) a coordination regime where governments coordinate their decisions to maximize aggregate surplus. Our analyses generate several intriguing findings. First, although charging a surplus-maximizing price seems to be a lucrative option, we find that a government does not always benefit by acting as a profit center. Second, the cost-sharing regime does not always incentivize the shared service adoption despite being often viewed as a fairer and more convenient arrangement. Third, we find that there can be significant under-utilization of shared services in the absence of proper coordination, in a sense that the governments may choose not to share their IT services even if doing so would increase their aggregate surplus. Finally, even though coordination promotes the adoption of shared IT services, it can sometimes be inefficient from the social welfare’s perspective because the increase in governments’ surplus can be outweighed by the decrease in the vendor’s profit. We also present a range of extensions to our model to show that our main takeaways carry over when some model assumptions are relaxed.",Crossref,94.63414634146342,10.25300/misq/2021/15573,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2021/15573,Goal 1,0.02848588784398737,False,
Management Control Systems and InnovationChina Management Accounting Review,"Chen, C. & Kim, M",2021,,"The opioid epidemic places a significant burden on families, communities, and health systems across the United States (1, 2). Prescription and illicit opioids are responsible for the highest drug overdose mortality rates ever recorded, accounting for 63600 deaths in 2016 (3). Health system and policy interventions have largely focused on reducing and monitoring high-risk opioid prescribing (4). Prescription drug monitoring programs seek to mitigate aberrant prescribing and patient misuse (4). The 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for opioid prescribing for chronic pain (5) have reduced prescribing volume and some high-risk prescribing (6), and payers have instituted measures to promote better prescribing (7, 8). These initiatives have largely focused on outpatient prescribing (9). Despite the Joint Commission's standards for inpatient pain management being implicated as a driver of increased opioid use, opioid prescribing in inpatient settings has received far less empirical evaluation (10). Recent studies reported that up to 13% of opioid-naive patients hospitalized for surgical procedures use opioids as outpatients for extended periods after surgery (1119). Research on opioid prescribing after nonsurgical hospitalization reported similar rates of persistent use (20). One study of more than 1 million nonsurgical admissions to 286 U.S. hospitals found that opioids were used 51% of the time (21). However, little is known about the timing, duration, and inpatient setting of opioid administration or whether particular inpatient patterns of use correlate with long-term use after discharge. To fill these knowledge gaps, we linked inpatient and outpatient electronic medical record data from a large health system between 2010 and 2014 to examine inpatient opioid administration among opioid-naive patients. We addressed 3 questions. First, who is most likely to receive opioids during a hospital stay? Second, when, where, and for how long are opioids used during hospital stays? Third, which patterns of opioid prescribing are associated with continued use after discharge? Methods Data Source We obtained data from the UPMC Health System, an integrated delivery and financing system that includes academic and community hospitals and accounts for 41% of hospital admissions in western Pennsylvania. We obtained hospital discharge data from 2010 to 2014 from 12 UPMC-affiliated community and academic hospitals. System-wide implementation of outpatient and inpatient electronic health records was complete before our study period. We linked inpatient electronic health record data (CERNER) to outpatient records (Epic Systems) using the health system's enterprise master patient index. We obtained the following data on inpatient encounters: demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race); diagnosis codes; admission type (medical vs. surgical); length of stay; intensive care unit (ICU) stay; source of insurance coverage; in-hospital mortality; and medication administration data, including drug name, route of administration, setting, and day and hour of administration. Information on prior home medications was collected by clinical personnel at the time of admission through patient or caregiver report. When a home medication list was not recorded, medication lists recorded in the discharge summary of a prior hospital stay were used when available. From the outpatient encounter database, we obtained information on outpatient visits before and after the index hospital stay along with outpatient medication lists. Medication data in the outpatient database represented the reconciled medication information that providers review during each visit and captured both active medications reported by patients and new prescriptions ordered by providers at outpatient visits. Study Sample Our sample included adults (aged 18 years) admitted to study hospitals from the emergency department, home, or transfers between 2010 and 2014 (Appendix Figure). We included admissions for opioid-naive patients, defined as those with no documented opioid use in the inpatient and outpatient encounter databases in the prior 12 months. We excluded admissions that were for deliveries, those occurring less than 90 days after a previous admission (we included only the first admission in such cases to allow for complete measurement of outpatient medication use), those that were missing complete inpatient medication records, and those for patients with no outpatient encounter in the 12 months before and after the admission (to ensure that we could measure outpatient opioid use after discharge). We included admissions for patients with diagnoses that typically prompt opioid treatment (such as burns, major trauma, and advanced cancer) because our objective was not to adjudicate appropriateness of opioid prescription but to analyze associations between inpatient use patterns and long-term use. Appendix Figure. Study flow diagram. Inpatient and Postdischarge Opioid Use Opioids were identified in inpatient and outpatient encounter databases using the same medication list (Appendix Table 1). We excluded partial opioid agonists that are approved for opioid use disorder treatment, such as buprenorphinenaloxone, from our definition of opioid use. Appendix Table 1. Types We constructed 3 outcomes related to opioid use. We measured the number of days on which any opioid was administered during the hospital stay, excluding perioperative use (24 hours after surgery). Almost all patients admitted for surgery received perioperative opioids, but use varied thereafter. The other 2 measures captured postdischarge use. Using outpatient records, we constructed dichotomous indicators for any opioid use recorded within 90 and 365 days after discharge. Opioid use recorded in the outpatient encounter database could represent self-reported use or prescriptions ordered during the encounter. We could not observe prescription fills in pharmacies by using the outpatient database. Patterns of Inpatient Opioid Administration To understand associations between patterns of inpatient analgesia (opioid and nonopioid) and subsequent outpatient use, we created measures reflecting the presence, timing, duration, and location of opioid and nonopioid analgesia administration during each hospital stay. These indicators included the number of calendar days of a stay with any opioid administration, timing of the last opioid administration relative to discharge (in hours), location of first use (for example, emergency department, ICU, or ward), and use of nonopioid analgesics (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen) (Appendix Table 1). Covariates On the basis of prior research and clinical judgment, we selected several patient- and discharge-level characteristics to include as covariates in our multivariable regression models. These included patient sex, age (as an ordinal variable), and race (white, black, or other); calendar year of admission (to account for time trends in opioid prescribing); hospital indicators (to account for differences in case mix and prescribing differences by hospital); payment source (commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, other, or uninsured) as a proxy for socioeconomic status; a 4-category variable that combined type of admission (medical or surgical) with whether the stay involved an ICU stay; Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Clinical Classifications Software categories based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (22), which we combined into 9 variables to capture reason for admission; Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score (range, 0 to 30); several comorbid conditions previously found to be associated with opioid use, including musculoskeletal pain, depression, other mental disorders, alcohol use disorders, drug dependence, and opioid poisoning (Supplement Table 1) (23); and an indicator for whether the patient had used benzodiazepines at home in the 12 months before admission. Length of hospital stay was included in statistical models as either an offset term or a covariate depending on the outcomes of interest. In-hospital mortality was obtained from inpatient records, and postdischarge mortality (treated as a competing event) was measured using monthly data that UPMC obtains from the Social Security Administration. Supplement. Supplementary Material Statistical Analysis Admission characteristics were summarized with descriptive statistics (mean and SD or median and interquartile range for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variables). We then conducted 3 analyses among opioid-naive hospitalized patients. First, we examined factors associated with inpatient opioid use (excluding the perioperative period) using multivariable Poisson models, where the dependent variable was the number of days an opioid was administered in the hospital, length of stay (in days) was log-transformed and treated as an offset term, and all covariates described earlier were included to adjust for case mix. We assessed model fit and found no evidence of overdispersion of the data and thus considered a Poisson model to be appropriate. We included hospital fixed effects to account for hospital-level confounding and robust SEs with clustering by patient to account for those with multiple hospital stays. We report adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs), 95% CIs, and P values for each covariate. Second, we fit 2 multinomial logistic regression models to examine the association between any inpatient opioid administration (excluding perioperative use for surgical patients) and any outpatient use within 90 or 365 days after discharge. To account for censoring of the outcome due to postdischarge death or readmission, we constructed the outcome variable as 4 mutually exclusive categories: presence of outpatient opioid use, absence of outpatient opioid use (without death or readmission), readmission without outpatient op",Semantic Scholar,39.52095808383233,10.7326/M18-2864,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f6e53ed932ab9a87dbe619d90419790b339cd81,Goal 3,0.04884622931835911,False,
Customer Satisfaction and Firm Profits in Monopolies: A Study of UtilitiesJournal of Marketing Research,"Bhattacharya, A. & Morgan, N. & Rego, L",2021,,"There is a growing body of evidence that customer satisfaction is predictive of firms’ future financial performance. However, studies of this relationship have been limited to competitive markets, and monopolistic markets have been largely ignored. This study explores the large and important utilities market and exploits its unique regulatory requirements that generate detailed and reliable operating and accounting data to examine the overall relationship between customer satisfaction and utility profit and establish the causal mechanisms involved. Using data from U.S. public utility firms, the authors show that even when customer satisfaction does not affect future revenues, it does positively predict future profitability by reducing utility firm operating costs. More specifically, they find that higher satisfaction reduces the costs of utility firm distribution, customer service, and sales and general administration expenses. These findings and additional post hoc evidence are consistent with the notion that customer satisfaction (1) generates efficiency-enhancing benefits for utility firms by lowering the direct and employee engagement costs of dealing with dissatisfied customers and (2) fosters greater trust and cooperation from customers.

Methodology: We adopt a Stackelberg framework in which the regulator, which cannot observe the manufacturer’s private cost information or level of effort, leads by imposing a postmarket study deadline. The profit-maximizing manufacturer then follows by establishing its level of effort to invest in its postmarket study. In establishing its deadline, the regulator optimizes the trade-off between providing public access to potentially effective drugs and mitigating public health risks from ineffective drugs. Results: We develop a deadline-dependent user fee menu as a screening mechanism that establishes an incentive for manufacturer compliance. We show that its effectiveness in inducing compliance depends fundamentally on the enforceability of sanction, a drug-specific measure that indicates how difficult it is to withdraw an unproven drug from the market, and the drug’s success probability: The higher either is, the higher is the probability that the mechanism induces compliance. Managerial implications: We synthesize and distill the salient trade-offs and nuances facing the FDA’s noncompliance problem and provide an implementable solution. We quantify the value of the solution as a function of a drug’s success probability and enforceability. From a public policy perspective, we provide guidance for the FDA to increase the viability and effectiveness of AP.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),84.66257668711657,,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2019.0822,Goal 3,0.04434140573573076,False,
Asset Volatility and Capital Structure: Evidence from Corporate MergersManagement Science,"Levine, O. & Wu, Y",2021,,"We exploit cross-sectional variation in the predictable changes in asset volatility following corporate acquisitions to identify the effect of business risk on capital structure. We find that postmerger changes in leverage and cash holdings are strongly predicted by expected asset volatility changes estimated using premerger information. These capital structure adjustments are partly achieved through the choice of payment method. Our findings provide direct evidence for the coinsurance effect of mergers on debt capacity. More broadly, they suggest that firm risk is a first-order determinant of leverage, consistent with the tradeoff theory of capital structure.

Reality Check: Infusing Ecological Value into Academic Marketing ResearchJournal of Marketing,"van Heerde, H. & Moorman, C. & Moreau, P. & Pamatier, R",2021,,"The Journal of Marketing highly values research rooted in marketing questions and problems experienced by key stakeholders. While some of the papers we receive have a healthy dose of this quality, many do not. We write this editorial because we see even greater opportunity for the field if we stay even closer to the “natural habitat” of marketing, marketing ecosystems, and the marketplace—what we refer to as the “real world” of marketing throughout the remainder of this editorial. By doing so, the field can access new lines of inquiry and fresh ideas that emerge from turning to marketing problems, practices, and critiques for inspiration. Opportunities include capturing data that reflect the reality of the marketplace, as well as using models and metrics that offer a more transparent view of the impact of our findings—whether dollars earned, behaviors changed, or lives saved. We worry that if we drift from the real world, the field may gravitate toward the study of small problems of little consequence, negating the important role that marketing can play in the world. Staying close to the real world is an important guardrail that can prevent such pitfalls and guide our discipline to a more influential future. In this editorial, we propose to evaluate research by a new standard, which we call “ecological value.” “Ecological” is defined by the Oxford Dictionary of English as “related to or concerned with the relation of living organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings.” In a marketing context, this means the interactions among and between marketing actors, institutions, and systems. “Value” means that the ideas have some usefulness; in our case, usefulness to the thinking and actions of marketing stakeholders, including consumers, marketing managers, policy makers, and societal stakeholders, including critics. Combining these words, ecological value (EV) is the degree to which research reflects and is relevant to marketing as it exists and evolves among marketing stakeholders and marketing ecosystems. Note that EV is different from external validity. External validity examines whether the study findings can be generalized across other contexts such as other consumption settings, other consumer populations, or other industries (Lynch 1982, 1983), whereas EV is a much broader concept and involves infusing a real-world perspective into every stage of the research process. In this editorial, we explain what EV means, why it is so important, and how you can generate it. We also offer concrete actions—reality checks—to support researchers who join our quest and for the gatekeepers (e.g., reviewers, AEs, editors) who support the knowledge development process. To the newer members of our field, we should point out that research high on EV matters not only to the discipline, but also to your own research agenda. Papers high in EV have greater publication prospects because editorial decisions, at least at JM, tend to be dominated by how interesting and important your ideas are.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),93.58974358974359,10.1177/0022242921992383,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79c6015624ce0e77591ff85b447c2350e00c89a4,Goal 9,0.0216526817938548,False,
Knowledge learning of insurance risks using dependence modelsINFORMS Journal on Computing,"Zhao, Z. & Shi, P. & Feng, X",2021,,"Learning the customers’ experience and behavior creates competitive advantages for any company over its rivals. The insurance industry is an essential sector in any developed economy and a better understanding of customers’ risk profile is critical to decision making in all aspects of insurance operations. In this paper, we explore the idea of using copula-based dependence models to learn the hidden risk of policyholders in property insurance. Specifically, we build a novel copula model to accommodate the dependence over time and over space among spatially clustered property risks. To tackle the computational challenge caused by the discreteness feature of large-scale insurance data, we propose an efficient multilevel composite likelihood approach for parameter estimation. Provided that latent risk induces correlation, the proposed customer learning method offers improved predictive analytics by allowing insurers to borrow strength from related risks in predicting new risks and also helps reveal the relative importance of the multiple sources of unobserved heterogeneity in updating policyholders’ risk profile. In the empirical study, we examine the loss cost of a portfolio of entities insured by a government property insurance program in Wisconsin. We find both significant temporal and spatial association among property risks. However, their effects on the predictive distribution of loss cost are different for the new and renewal policyholders. The two sources of dependence are complements for the former and substitutes for the latter. These findings are shown to have substantial managerial implications in key insurance operations such as experience rating, capital allocation, and reinsurance arrangement.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),93.91304347826087,,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2020.1005,Goal 3,0.0145003565001842,False,

Using nationally representative data, cluster expenditure distributions are wider for the most expensive clusters and smallest for the least expensive clusters. The clusters using comorbidities show larger separation between the highest two clusters and the remaining clusters than clusters developed excluding comorbidities. Though the profiles designed are representative of U.S. adults, the approach can be applied to any insured population to reveal the impact of the profiles on utilization.

Thus, using PWYW as part of multiple pricing strategy may be especially costly when firms rely on dedicated patronage by consumers.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),96.03960396039604,10.2139/ssrn.3662817,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0d52da0cbb2206530f6c8679f4245e44da72e07,Goal 1,0.01030160604309833,False,
How service quality variability hurts revenue when customers learn: Implications for dynamic personalized pricingOperations Research,"DeCroix, G. & Long, X. & Tong, J",2021,,"Most service settings involve some degree of variability in the quality of customers’ experiences. An understudied mechanism is analyzed by which this variability can reduce firm revenues when customers do not know true service quality but rather learn about that quality over time based on their experiences. Essentially, customers get stuck with low-quality opinions and low purchase likelihoods after unusually bad experiences. However, high-quality opinions after unusually good experiences are quickly corrected. The authors show that dynamic pricing can help mitigate this effect. Specifically, if the firm can set individual prices so that each customer perceives the same surplus, then the variability impact is entirely eliminated. They also demonstrate that simpler heuristics similar to those observed in practice (requiring less information and pricing flexibility) can partially mitigate the revenue loss.",Crossref,83.26530612244898,10.1287/opre.2020.2058,https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2020.2058,Goal 17,0.008157514692849093,False,
Green Premium in the Tokyo Office Building MarketSustainability,"Onishi, J. & Deng, Y. & Shimizu, C",2021,,"More than 10 years have passed since studies on green buildings gained attention in the academic and industrial literature. Many studies report the economic value of green buildings, mainly in the U.S. and European markets. An empirical clarification of the dynamics of green premiums has significant implications for future urban sustainability. This study constructed a dataset of Tokyo office rents from 2009 to 2019. We estimated the green office rental premium using a hedonic approach. Our results show that, on average, an office property with a green label gains a premium of approximately 6.5% on contract rents. The Tokyo office market is heterogeneous, and endogeneity is an issue when identifying the green premium. We addressed the endogeneity issue with propensity score clustering. As a result of our estimation, the premium was approximately +5.4% for medium-sized old buildings and +2.6% for large-sized new buildings.",Crossref,84.61538461538461,10.3390/su132112227,https://doi.org/10.3390/su132112227,Goal 11,0.06490777428297285,True,green public spaces; urban sustainability policies
Mortgage Brokers and the Effectiveness of Regulatory OversightsManagement Science,"Agarwal, S. & Ang, S. & Deng, Y. & Wang, Y",2021,,"This paper studies the responses among different types of mortgage brokers to occupational licensing regulations. By explicitly accounting for heterogeneities between sole and corporate brokers, we find evidence that sole brokers respond to financial regulatory oversight by applying a more stringent screening process in conducting brokerage activities, hence achieving better loan performances. Specifically, loans originated through sole brokers exhibit higher quality on an array of credit-relevant characteristics, including those reported and unreported to future investors. By contrast, we find no such regulatory effect on corporate brokers who tend to rely extensively on reported characteristics that are critical to the subsequent loan securitization at the expense of unreported information despite the latter indicating potential risks. Hence, the agency problem among sole brokers can be mitigated by the consolidated financial requirement for occupational licensing. However, such provision is ineffective in governing corporate brokers. Additionally, welfare gains associated with the occupational licensing regulation are achieved at the expense of prospective borrowers paying a higher loan price and having reduced credit access. Stricter licensing regulations may induce welfare loss related to credit rationing as reasonable loan applications are not funded, including those with potentially lower default risk.

We propose a novel measure of cultural distance for each homebuyer–neighborhood pair, adopting the six‐dimensional cultural framework of Hofstede. Our measure captures interethnicity similarity and thus measures the cultural similarity of each buyer and neighborhood pair at a more granular level. Utilizing housing transaction data of a culturally diverse city Sydney, Australia, we find that buyers are more likely to buy properties in neighborhoods with a shorter cultural distance to their culture of origin and are willing to pay a premium for properties in those locations, consistent with buyers’ preference for cultural proximity. Further, we show that cultural proximity preference is stronger for ethnicities from recent migration waves, particularly Asia.

Default Option Exercise over the Financial Crisis and BeyondReview of Finance,"An, X. & Deng, Y. & Gabriel, S",2021,,Abstract We document changes in borrowers’ sensitivity to negative equity and show heightened borrower default propensity as a fundamental driver of crisis period mortgage defaults. Estimates of a time-varying coefficient competing risk hazard model reveal a marked run-up in the default option beta from 0.2 during 2003–06 to about 1.5 during 2012–13. Simulation of 2006 vintage loan performance shows that the marked upturn in the default option beta resulted in a doubling of mortgage default incidence. Panel data analysis indicates that much of the variation in default option exercise is associated with the local business cycle and consumer distress.

How Does Mortgage Debt Affect Household Consumption? Micro Evidence from ChinaReal Estate Economics,"Fan, Y. & Yavas, A",2020,,"Abstract The high growth rate of mortgage debt in various emerging and developed economies has captured headlines following the financial crisis. In this article, we investigate how mortgage debt impacts household consumption behavior and various components of household consumption. Utilizing comprehensive household survey data from China, we show that households with a mortgage consume a higher portion of income than households without a mortgage. This is in line with the argument that having a mortgage reduces the uncertainty that the household faces regarding how much to save each month in order to be able to own a house, and this reduced uncertainty leads to lower monthly savings for the purpose of buying a house. We also find that among households with a mortgage, those who spend a larger share of their income on mortgage payments spend less on consumption, reflecting the crowding out effect of mortgage payments on household consumption. Furthermore, we show that a government policy of decreasing the maximum loan‐to‐value ratio has a significant impact on households’ consumption. The article offers the first evidence of the impact of growing mortgage debt on the consumption behavior of households, and will have implications for government policies that encourage mortgage borrowing.",Crossref,96.0,10.1111/1540-6229.12244,https://doi.org/10.1111/1540-6229.12244,Goal 17,0.02469361551158411,False,

Coordination and Dynamic Promotion Strategies in Crowdfunding with Network ExternalitiesProduction and Operations Management,"Li, Z. & Duan, J. & Ransbotham, S",2020,,"Crowdfunding, a peer‐to‐peer fundraising mechanism, solicits capital from individual backers to support entrepreneurial projects.

This study models the dynamics of backers’ contributions in the presence of success uncertainty and analyzes managerial promotion strategies to maximize the likelihood of funding success. Two opposing forces affect backer decisions: backers are more likely to back a project that has already reached a greater fraction of its funding goal (positive externalities), but the backing propensity declines over time (negative deadline effects). These two competing forces give rise to a time‐dependent critical threshold of funding that a project must attain to achieve successful funding.

These frictions, which bind most severely during recessions, may significantly inhibit monetary policy pass‐through. To study their effects on refinancing, we exploit a Federal Housing Administration policy change that excluded unemployed borrowers from refinancing and increased others' out‐of‐pocket costs substantially. These changes dramatically reduced refinancing rates, particularly among the likely unemployed and those facing new out‐of‐pocket costs.

In this program, private insurers sell identical flood contracts at identical rates and bear no risk of paying claims. About 12 percent of new policyholders overinsure, selecting a coverage limit that exceeds their home's estimated replacement cost. Overinsuring is expensive relative to expected loss, making it difficult to explain with standard decision‐making models. The rate of overinsuring differs substantially across insurers, ranging from zero to one‐third of new policies. Insurer effects on the likelihood of overinsuring are statistically significant after controlling for the policyholder's characteristics. Additionally, some insurers seem to encourage households to overinsure in percentage terms (e.g., buy 110 percent of replacement cost) while others encourage rounding up in dollars (e.g., to the next $ 10,000).

The response to COVID-19 in the United States has been hampered by an overall lack of diagnostic testing capacity. To address uncertainty about ongoing levels of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission early in the pandemic, we aimed to develop a surveillance tool using readily available emergency department (ED) operations data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). This involved optimizing the identification of acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related encounters and then comparing metrics for these encounters before and after the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Methods We performed an observational study using operational EHR data from two Midwest EDs with a combined annual census of over 80,000. Data were collected three weeks before and after the first confirmed case of local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. To optimize capture of ARI cases, we compared various metrics including chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and ARI-related orders. Operational metrics for ARI cases, including volume, pathogen identification, and illness severity, were compared between the preand post-community transmission timeframes using chi-square tests of independence. Results Compared to our combined definition of ARI, chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and isolation orders individually identified less than half of the cases. Respiratory pathogen testing was the top performing individual ARI definition but still only identified 72.2% of cases. From the pre to post periods, we observed significant increases in ED volumes due to ARI and ARI cases without identified pathogen. Conclusion Certain methods for identifying ARI cases in the ED may be inadequate and multiple criteria should be used to optimize capture. In the absence of widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing, operational metrics for ARI-related encounters, especially the proportion of cases involving negative pathogen testing, are useful indicators for active surveillance of potential COVID-19 related ED visits.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),87.23404255319149,10.5811/westjem.2020.5.47606,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f6d6ceaf9bd8f47fe271f4813bc4e3601380773,Goal 3,0.02019278980797568,False,COVID-19 impact

The starting point is a research design that identifies a source of exogenous variation in an amenity that is observable by prospective buyers (e.g., air quality). Data on the sales prices and physical attributes of houses, together with location-specific measures for amenities, are then used to estimate a housing-price function. Under ideal conditions, the derivative of this price function can be interpreted as indicating the amenity’s implicit price, which can then be used to calculate household marginal WTP for the amenity. In principle, this process is straightforward. In practice, modeling decisions must be made to define variables that measure sale prices and amenities and to select an econometric specification.

Persuading the Principal to WaitJournal of Political Economy,"Orlov, D. & Skrzypacz, A. & Zryumov, P",2020,,"A principal decides when to exercise a real option. A biased agent influences this decision by strategically disclosing information. Committing to disclose all information with a delay is the optimal way to persuade the principal to wait.

"Auditors, Specialists, and Professional Jurisdiction in Audits of Fair ValuesContemporary Accounting Research","Griffith, E",2020,,"ABSTRACT Auditors frequently use valuation specialists to help them evaluate fair values, but researchers and regulators know little about how auditors use these specialists. Based on interviews with 28 auditors and 14 valuation specialists, I develop a theoretical framework informed by expert systems and professional competition theories. The interviews suggest that institutional pressures in the fair value environment unevenly impact auditors and specialists, causing tension between auditors' needs for ontological security and jurisdictional claims. This tension leads to one‐sided competition between auditors and specialists and incomplete acceptance of specialists' work. Auditors' competitive behaviors coupled with this incomplete acceptance result in a tendency to make specialists' work conform to auditors' views. Collectively, these findings suggest that auditors use specialists as an institutional mechanism to create comfort, but not insight. This study links expert systems and professional competition theories, and it provides critical insight into some assumptions underlying tenets of each theory. It also informs researchers, regulators, and practitioners interested in understanding and addressing problems related to the use of specialists.",Crossref,95.23809523809524,10.1111/1911-3846.12506,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12506,Goal 16,0.009209585299498736,False,

The answer to this question isn’t straightforward, as research is mixed when it comes to understanding how unethical people will be when they might acquire something good versus avoid something bad. To wit, research has found that people cheat more in a loss (vs. gain) frame, yet research on regulatory focus has found that people cheat more in a promotion focus (where the focus is on acquiring gains) than in a prevention focus (where the focus is on avoiding losses). Through a large-scale field study containing 332,239 observations including 27,350 transgressions, we address the contradictory results of gain/loss frames and regulatory focus on committing unethical behavior in a context that contains a high risk of detecting unethical behavior (NFL football games). Our results replicated the separate effects of more cheating in a loss frame, and more cheating in a promotion focus. Furthermore, our data revealed a heretofore undocumented crossover interaction, in accordance with regulatory fit, which could disentangle past results: Specifically, we found promotion focus is associated with more cheating in a loss (vs. gain) frame, whereas prevention focus is associated with more cheating in a gain (vs. loss) frame.

The TCJA decreases the corporate tax rate from 35 percent in 2017 to 21 percent in 2018 and thereafter. This change incentivizes firms to increase 2017 pension contributions to take advantage of tax deductions at a higher rate. Consistent with this incentive, we find firms increase defined benefit pension contributions by an average of 25 to 31 percent in 2017 compared with earlier years. We also find that taxpaying firms are the primary contributors. Further, taxpaying firms with high levels of pension‐related deferred tax assets contribute over three times as much as taxpaying firms with low levels of pension‐related deferred tax assets. We also find firms that increase pension contributions in 2017 reduce 2018 contributions, consistent with intertemporal income shifting rather than a permanent change in pension funding strategy.",Crossref,87.74193548387098,10.1111/1911-3846.12604,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12604,Goal 8,0.007649490540061157,False,

In contrast, we examine initiating touch. Individuals instructed to touch engage in egocentric projection in which they project their own affective reaction onto their expectations for how the recipient will feel (i.e., empathic forecast), how they appear to the recipient (i.e., metaperception), and the evaluation of the interaction itself (i.e., interaction awkwardness). Touch initiators expect that recipients will feel worse with touch, express concern for how they, themselves, will be perceived, and think that interactions are more awkward. Interestingly, touch recipients do not evaluate these interactions more negatively and leave higher tips after having been touched; touch initiators do not expect this to be the case. As a result, instructed touch initiators (vs. volitional touch initiators) are less (more) likely to engage in subsequent interactions with customers, potentially undermining future service provided to customers. Across five studies, four of which involve actual dyadic interactions, we test the consequences of initiating touch with an inquiry into the effects of interpersonal touch on the initiator.

Admission control biases in hospital unit capacity management: How occupancy information hurdles and decision noise impact utilizationManagement Science,"Kim, S. & Tong, J. & Peden, C",2020,,"Providing patients with timely care from the appropriate unit involves both correct clinical evaluation of patient needs and making admission decisions to effectively manage a unit with limited capacity in the face of stochastic patient arrivals and lengths of stay. We study human decision behavior in the latter operations management task. Using behavioral models and controlled experiments in which physicians and MTurk workers manage a simulated hospital unit, we identify cognitive and environmental factors that drive systematic admission decision bias. We report on two main findings. First, seemingly innocuous “occupancy information hurdles” (e.g., having to type a password to view current occupancy) can cause a chain of events that leads physicians to maintain systematically lower unit utilization. Specifically, these hurdles cause physicians to make most admission decisions without checking the current unit occupancy. Then—between the times that they do check—physicians underestimate the number of available beds when occupancy increases from admissions are more salient than occupancy decreases from discharges. Second, decision-related random error or “noise” leads to higher- or lower-than-optimal utilization of hospital units in predictable patterns, depending on the system parameters. We provide evidence that these patterns are due to some settings providing more opportunity for physicians to mistakenly admit patients and other settings that provide more opportunity to mistakenly reject patients. These findings help identify when and why clinicians are likely to make inefficient decisions because of human cognitive limitations and suggest mitigation strategies to help hospital units improve their capacity management.

Modeling payment timing in multiechelon inventory systems with applications to supply chain coordinationManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Tong, J. & DeCroix, G. & Song, J",2020,,"Problem definition: How can one adapt multiechelon inventory models to capture the cash flows generated by various payment-timing contracts? What competitive inventory policy behavior arises under these various payment-timing arrangements? Academic/practical relevance: Technology advancements are increasing the variety of payment triggers between supply chain stages. However, traditional multiechelon inventory models, which were originally developed for vertically integrated systems, do not explicitly account for payments flowing up the supply chain nor issues of payment timing between stages. Methodology: We introduce an analytical modeling methodology to incorporate financial inventory costs generated by payment-timing arrangements between stages in multiechelon inventory models. We also combine these methods with established inventory theory to study competitive inventory policies in a two-echelon system. Results: Under a class of payment-timing contracts, we show how to express payment flows at each stage in terms of standard physical inventory metrics and the demand-arrival process. We also show how to calculate the average inventory costs for each stage under given inventory policies and payment-timing contracts. In the two-echelon base-stock model, we first show that the cost of decentralization under standard wholesale price contracts is significantly driven by too much inventory at the supplier; it is not exclusively driven by too little inventory at the retailer as in the selling-to-the-newsvendor literature. We show that wholesale price contracts with a type of popular consignment payment timing still leads to too little inventory at the retailer. However, we prove there exists a wholesale price contract with partial consignment timing that can achieve the centralized inventory levels at both the supplier and the retailer.

We find that raters assign more biased ratings to help the producer they know compete, and this distortion is exacerbated when the reputation cost for rating unobjectively is lowered. Counterintuitively, when both of the raters know the same producer, the likelihood of biased ratings drops significantly. To explain the empirical regularities, we develop a behavioral economics model and show that the rater’s utility function should account not only for social preferences toward the producer, but also the rater’s psychological aversion toward favoring a producer more than the other rater.

Incorporating a ‘Better’ Behavioral Bias for Both Consumers and Firms in Rebate ProgramsManagement Science,"Chung, K",2020,,"We study a rebate program in the credit card industry where the firm automatically processed the rebate earned by consumers with flexible and effortless redemption opportunities in future transactions. Contrary to what the normative economic theory would predict, we document that consumers frequently failed to redeem their rebate. Given this observation, we examine what may have been the primary driving force behind this pattern and the implications for the firm. We provide evidence that the phenomenon that we observe in our study is a result of cardholders being influenced by the way their outcomes were framed. We find that redemption incidences coincide with episodes where rebates are a larger portion of the amount spent. On the basis of the empirical regularities, we formulate a model of cardholder behavior where the cardholder experiences increasing psychological utility when rebate redemption yields a deeper discount. The model estimates indicate that, although delayed redemption left customers monetarily worse off in each transaction (cardholders passed up on average $0.76 of card-level benefits to experience greater psychological utility), once the psychological utility is taken into account, customers were shown to fare better overall. For the firm, in addition to the card benefits that were passed up, the psychological utility generated an additional average benefit of $1.21 per redemption.

Besides drawing on their legacy resources, pre‐entrants during industry incubation commonly use alliances and acquisitions to obtain technical capabilities and complementary assets, thereby creating a portfolio of sourcing modes that collectively shapes the firms' paths to potential market entry. We identify a key pattern at the intersection of type of sourcing mode and type of resource: pre‐entrants to the incubation stage are more likely to use alliances to source technical capabilities, while using acquisitions to source specialized complementary assets. Our empirical context is the agricultural biotechnology industry. Managerial summary Firms typically seek new resources when they begin exploring potential industries, before any products have reached the market, yet the needed investments face substantial uncertainties. This article highlights a pattern in how firms use alliances and acquisitions for technical capabilities and complementary resources during the incubation stage of the agricultural biotechnology industry. We focus on two key features of the external sourcing activity, differing based on the type of resource: developing new core technologies, which often starts early, tends to leverage external alliance partners; by contrast, establishing complementary assets tends to start later through acquisitions.

From Rugged Landscapes to Rugged Ecosystems: Structure of Interdependencies and Firms’ Innovative SearchAcademy of Management Review,"Ganco, M. & Kapoor, R. & Lee, G",2020,,"Managers and academics are increasingly viewing innovating firms as being interdependent on other firms in the business ecosystem. But how might the structure of interdependencies shape the innovativeness of firms in an ecosystem? To answer this question, we develop a search-based theory that considers a multiplicity of upstream and downstream firms simultaneously innovating in an ecosystem, contributing to and searching for novel combinations of components. We conceptualize two types of structural interdependencies between firms in an ecosystem based on the structure of technological interactions between components and the structure of input–output flows between stages of production. Using a simulation model, we show that downstream firms can benefit from mixing and matching components produced upstream, whereas upstream firms can benefit from optimizing their search more narrowly around their focal components. Importantly, these benefits that accrue to upstream and downstream firms are significantly impacted by the structure of technological and flow interdependencies in the ecosystem.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),81.27853881278538,,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2017.0549,Goal 15,0.03582591224211999,False,

When Your Problem Becomes My Problem: The Impact of Airline IT Disruptions on On-Time Performance of Competing AirlinesStrategic Management Journal,"Tae, C. & Pang, M. & Greenwood, B",2020,,"Research Summary We study the effect of firm disruptions on competitor performance in the presence of shared resources in the U.S. airline industry. While scholars have investigated both the effects of industry‐wide and firm‐specific disruptions, little work has examined the effect on competitors, who are increasingly reliant on interconnected resources in the digital age. Results from a series of recent information technology (IT) outages indicate that performance is materially affected by a competitor's disruption. While the disruption of a full‐service carrier significantly delays flights of all airlines leveraging its hubs, the exact opposite is observed during the disruption of a low cost carrier. Further, the effect is strongly moderated by the type of airlines reacting to the disruption. Implications for managers and theory are discussed within. Managerial Summary What happens to my operations when a competitor's operations are disrupted? While research has examined how a disrupted firm can recover, little attention has been paid to competitors, except their ability to exploit the disruption for economic gain. This is problematic, as firms increasingly leverage interconnected resources and infrastructure. We show that an airline's IT outages affect on‐time performance of competitors' flights to and from its hub airports. However, the effects depend on both who is disrupted, and who is reacting to that disruption. The disruptions of full‐service carriers (FSCs) delay competitors' flights, but that of a low‐cost carrier (LCC) leads to early arrivals and departures. Further, LCCs are significantly more nimble reacting to disruptions compared to FSCs.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),95.96412556053812,10.2139/ssrn.3135500,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fca6db065540c1a905c2b2fb0e87a14f4d220291,Goal 9,0.03619579144924594,False,industry; infrastructure; infrastructure investment; supply chain disruptions
Sliced Designs for Multiplatform Online ExperimentsTechnometrics,"Sadeghi, S. & Chien, P. & Arora, N",2020,,"Abstract Multivariate testing is a popular method to improve websites, mobile apps, and email campaigns. A unique aspect of testing in the online space is that it needs to be conducted across multiple platforms such as a desktop and a smartphone. The existing experimental design literature does not offer precise guidance for such a multi-platform context. In this article, we introduce a multi-platform design framework that allows us to measure the effect of the design factors for each platform and the interaction effect of the design factors with platforms. Substantively, the resulting designs are of great importance for testing digital campaigns across platforms. We illustrate this in an empirical email application to maximize engagement for a digital magazine. We introduce a novel “sliced effect hierarchy principle” and develop design criteria to generate factorial designs for multi-platform experiments. To help construct such designs, we prove a theorem that connects the proposed designs to the well-known minimum aberration designs. We find that experimental versions made for one platform should be similar to other platforms. From the standpoint of real-world application, such homogeneous subdesigns are cheaper to implement. To assist practitioners, we provide an algorithm to construct the designs that we propose.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),86.20689655172414,10.1080/00401706.2019.1647288,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/271e83d1f6ac7b054ea8a0e96cae4e2495b78401,Goal 12,0.007879330664423936,False,
Customization in Luxury Brands: Can Valentino Get Personal?Journal of Marketing Research,"Moreau, P",2020,,"Luxury brands have started to offer consumers the opportunity to customize their exclusive products by making certain aesthetic decisions, such as the color, fabric, or cut of their products. A robust finding in the marketing literature is that consumers place a greater value on customized than on standard products because these unique products better fit and communicate their tastes, preferences, and identity. However, the majority of focal products in these studies fall outside the luxury segment. The authors demonstrate that consumers’ customization preferences differ between mainstream and luxury brands. In the luxury segment, consumers pay a premium for the designer’s expertise and the status that it can convey. As such, the consumers’ desire for self-expression can potentially erode the product’s signaling value. Through a series of four experiments, the authors demonstrate that luxury brands can benefit from customization but they can also take customization too far. Their findings suggest that brand managers should allow consumers to make fewer design decisions for luxury versus mainstream brands to preserve the signal value created by the designer.",Crossref,90.74074074074073,10.1177/0022243720943191,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720943191,Goal 12,0.01715182495639314,False,

Regression for copula-linked compound distributions with applications in modeling aggregate insurance claimAnnals of Applied Statistics,"Shi, P. & Zhao, Z",2020,,"In actuarial research, a task of particular interest and importance is to predict the loss cost for individual risks so that informative decisions are made in various insurance operations such as underwriting, ratemaking, and capital management. The loss cost is typically viewed to follow a compound distribution where the summation of the severity variables is stopped by the frequency variable. A challenging issue in modeling such outcome is to accommodate the potential dependence between the number of claims and the size of each individual claim. In this article, we introduce a novel regression framework for compound distributions that uses a copula to accommodate the association between the frequency and the severity variables, and thus allows for arbitrary dependence between the two components. We further show that the new model is very flexible and is easily modified to account for incomplete data due to censoring or truncation. The flexibility of the proposed model is illustrated using both simulated and real data sets. In the analysis of granular claims data from property insurance, we find substantive negative relationship between the number and the size of insurance claims.

"A Picture is Worth a Thousand Dollars, Even to Student-Athletes: An Analysis of the NCAA’s Recommendations for Name, Image, and Likeness Income36 Entertainment and Sports Lawyer 72","Misey Jr., R",2020,,"BACKGROUND
Six years ago, the O'Bannon v. NCAA 2 case provided land-mark precedent for student-athlete earnings. However, opportunities to earn NIL income through social media did not exist as they do today. O'Bannon determined that pre-venting payment to student-athletes from using their NIL violated federal antitrust laws. In the aftermath, EA Sports paid $40 million to the plaintiff class of more than 100,000 student-athletes. 3 At that time, Instagram was growing at accelerating rates, but O'Bannon was narrow in scope, focusing on the portrayal of student-athletes in EA Sports' NCAA video games. 4 While O'Bannon affirmed that student-athletes held intellectual property rights to their own NIL, the NCAA stopped working with EA Sports to pro-duce video games, ostensibly to prevent profiting from the student-athletes use of their NIL in a manner inconsistent with the NCAA's educational goals. Now, six years later, social media has evolved into its own full-fledged industry. Social media has created new opportunities for celebrities, such as some student-athletes, to earn income. An individual can now make a career as an"" influencer"" by accumulating large numbers of people to follow one's profile. For example, a former contestant on The Bachelor stated that she could earn $250 just by holding a product open in a picture and posting it on her Instagram account. 5 These influencers may also become brand ambassadors for everything from clothing lines to food delivery services.
Many businesses now use the social media profiles of athletes to promote their businesses and products. PK Subban of the New Jersey Devils is one of Adidas' numerous hockey brand ambassadors, often promoting new Adidas shoes and other apparel on his personal social media pages. Due to the increase in professional athletes engaging in social media advertising, the NCAA needed to proactively deal with legal issues that could potentially arise from college athletes engaging in social media advertising. Moreover, considering the corruption scandals involving NCAA bas-ketball and a few shoe and apparel companies, the NCAA needed to provide rules that balance the NCAA's educa-tional goals with the rights of student-athletes to profit from their NIL.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),93.68029739776952,,https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/entspl36&section=49,Goal 1,0.0391187425154593,False,

How Does Household Spending Respond to an Epidemic?

Prominence and Engagement: Different Mechanisms Regulating Continuance and Contribution in Online CommunitiesJournal of Management Information Systems,"KUEM, J. & Khansa, L. & Kim, S",2020,,"ABSTRACT Online communities have suffered from their members’ intermittent, dormant, or nonexistent participation. We propose that prominence, which refers to the salience of community members’ psychological proximity to their community, differs from the engagement construct, which denotes a psychological dedication to behave prosaically toward other community members. Whereas engagement has been increasingly examined as a driver of online community behavior, the role of prominence has received a minimal amount of attention in the literature. Drawing on self-determination theory, we developed a framework that proposes the prominence construct as a phenomenon distinctive from engagement in its nature, formation, and behavioral outcomes. Our findings based on two studies indicate that the proposed model with prominence performs considerably better than the existing model with only engagement. Our conceptual model contributes to Information Systems research by laying a strong theoretical foundation to differentiate between the behavioral paths of the autonomous prominence construct and its controlled engagement counterpart.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),93.93939393939394,10.1080/07421222.2019.1705510,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b339fa3a5d604d881c643360750596e9a9a9440a,Goal 17,0.01299585965252558,False,

Value Relevance of Disaggregated Information: An Examination of the Rate and Volume Analysis of Bank Net Interest IncomeAccounting Horizons,"Warfield, T. & Burke, Q. & Wieland, M",2020,,"SYNOPSIS A potentially important form of financial information disaggregation is to segregate the change in an income measure into its underlying performance drivers. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the usefulness of such disaggregation to investors. We utilize the volume and rate analysis in banks' 10-K filings, in which banks disaggregate annual changes in net interest income into changes in the balances (“volume variance”) and changes in the rates (“rate variance”) of assets and liabilities. We document that volume and rate variances are associated with bank characteristics, including market power, funding sources, and credit risk. We find volume and rate variances are predictive of future net interest income and are positively associated with stock returns and prices, suggesting the disaggregated information is value relevant.

Discussion of Moving the Conceptual Framework Forward Accounting for UncertaintyContemporary Accounting Research,"Linsmeier, T",2020,,"ABSTRACT To meet the objectives of financial reporting in the IASB's Conceptual Framework, the “balance‐sheet approach” embraced by the Framework is necessary but not sufficient. Critical, but largely overlooked, is the role of uncertainty, which we argue defines the role of accrual accounting as a distinctive source of information for investors when investment outcomes are uncertain. This role is in some sense paradoxical: on the one hand, uncertainty undermines both the balance sheet (because uncertain assets are unrecognized) and the income statement (because mismatching is unavoidable). However, these inevitable accounting effects can be exploited to provide information about uncertainty, though not by a balance‐sheet approach alone. Rather, balance sheet recognition and measurement criteria are established by consideration of the impact of uncertainty on matching and mismatching in the income statement. This combination of balance‐sheet and income‐statement approaches enhances the communication of information to investors under conditions of uncertainty, thereby giving greater clarity and purpose in satisfying the objective of the Framework to provide information about “the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows.”",Crossref,81.41592920353982,10.1111/1911-3846.12585,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12585,Goal 10,0.01199309095465024,False,

According to recent research conducted on the influence of mobile apps, we also need to look at how digital spaces enable interactions among individuals. We use large-scale geospatial data analysis to study millions of postings in an app called Waze. We conceptualize a novel factor called virtual crowdedness, which is the density of usage of the app in a specific neighborhood. We find that displaying the density of a user’s “virtual activities” can both encourage and discourage participation by the entire community. We find that participation in virtual settings is akin to what economists describe as a public good, where only a few individuals contribute but create well-being for the entire community. Users’ motivation to participate in virtual settings depends on what is termed “impure altruism” by economists, where participation is heavily influenced by motives of prestige and public recognition. These motivations are reinforced through intensive social interactions among members of such communities. We also find there is a strong bystander effect in these virtual communities.

Financial intermediaries face a cost of bearing risk, so they choose the least risky portfolio that backs their issuance of riskless deposits: a diversified pool of nonfinancial firms' debt. Nonfinancial firms choose their capital structure to exploit the resulting segmentation between debt and equity markets.

Using an experiment, we examine whether the effects of performance measure noise on employees' learning depends on the type of learning in which employees engage: experiential versus vicarious. We predict and find performance measure noise has a more deleterious effect on learning when such learning occurs experientially rather than vicariously. Specifically, we find experiential learners demonstrate less learning as performance measure noise increases, but vicarious learners show no such effect of performance measure noise. Collectively, our findings suggest performance measure noise and learning type play important roles in the extent to which firms realize the decision-facilitating benefits of performance measurement systems. In particular, since much of the learning in modern organizations occurs vicariously, our findings suggest performance measure noise may not be as detrimental to employees' learning as previously thought.",Crossref,95.51020408163265,10.2308/accr-52613,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-52613,Goal 4,0.03122807807433872,False,
Wage Transparency and Social Comparison in Salesforce CompensationManagement Science,"Long, X. & Nasiry, J",2020,,"When wages are transparent, sales agents may compare their pay with that of their peers and experience positive or negative feelings if those peers are paid (respectively) less or more. We investigate the implications of such social comparisons on sales agents’ effort decisions and their incentives to help or collaborate with each other. We then characterize the firm’s optimal sales force compensation scheme and the conditions under which wage transparency benefits the firm. Our results show that the work environment—which includes such aspects as demand uncertainty, correlation across sales territories, and the possibility of help/collaboration—plays a significant role in the firm’s compensation and wage transparency decisions. In particular, wage transparency is more likely to benefit the firm when demand uncertainty is low, sales outcomes are positively correlated across different sales territories, and sales agents can collaborate at low cost. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, social comparisons need not reduce collaboration among agents.

A Behavioral Study of Abandonment Decisions in Multi-Stage ProjectsManagement Science,"Long, X. & Nasiry, J. & Wu, Y",2020,,"In uncertain environments, project reviews provide an opportunity to make “continue or abandon” decisions and thereby maximize a project’s expected payoff. We experimentally investigate continue/abandon decisions in a multistage project under two conditions: when the project is reviewed at every stage and when review opportunities are limited. Our results confirm findings in the literature that project abandonment tends to be delayed; yet, we also observe premature termination. Decisions are highly path dependent; in particular, subjects are more likely to abandon after observing reduced project value, and abandonment rate is higher near the middle—rather than near the beginning or end—of a project. Interestingly, when reviews are limited, subjects are less likely to continue a project that should be abandoned. At the same time, subjects are more inclined to review again after receiving negative (rather than positive) news. Our data are explained well by a model that incorporates three behavioral concepts—gains or losses from comparing the project value with an internal adaptive reference point, sunk cost bias, and status quo bias.

Social Cognitive TheoryOxford Classics in Management,"Stajkovic, A. & Sergent, K",2019,,"In conceptualizations presented in social cognitive theory (SCT), humans are not passive objects shaped and shepherded by contingent consequences of an environment. People are agentic; they proactively make their way through the intricacies and dualities of life. To attain desired outcomes, people make judgments about the interplay among environment, personal factors, and consequences of their behavior. SCT conceptualizes these cognitive appraisals in terms of triadic, reciprocal, and asymmetric influences among the environment, person, and behavior. The belief system formed by the model’s cognitive dynamics is shaped by one’s current working conception of the world. This belief system guides behavior adaptively toward desirable pursuits and away from undesirable consequences. As people set goals, devise accordant courses of action, and anticipate outcomes, they act on this thread of beliefs. People operate on the environment, they monitor and analyze their actions, reflect on the consequences, and react to course-correct. These behaviors rely on self-awareness, self-reflection, and adaptive self-regulation. To explain and predict the fluent vagaries of social life, nuanced conceptions of interactive factors are conferred by SCT in the triadic model. A transformative contributor to adaptive self-regulation in SCT is perceived self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is a malleable belief formed by personal appraisal of how well a person can execute courses of action required to deal successfully with a given prospect. Self-efficacy does not signify people believe they can walk on water; it simply implies they believe they can enact the potential they already have. Even when people have acquired the knowledge and ability to succeed, cherished outcomes are forsaken if they harbor doubt in their capacity to self-regulate.",Crossref,82.05128205128204,10.1093/obo/9780199846740-0169,https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199846740-0169,Goal 6,0.035872967677639,False,
The Best Laid Plans: Why New Parents Fail to Habituate PracticesJournal of Consumer Research,"Thomas, T. & Epp, A",2019,,"Abstract Consumers regularly fail to habituate newly adopted practices. In contrast to established practices, this often occurs because understanding a practice is different from actually doing it. Our work explores this “messiness of doing” and explains why consumers successfully habituate some newly adopted practices after experiencing obstacles (i.e., misaligned practice elements) but not others. Utilizing a longitudinal approach that follows first-time parents from pregnancy through the first eight months postpartum, we track how parents plan for practices and how those plans unfold. We document a process whereby parents first engage in extensive planning and preparation prior to the birth of their child, during which parents build two realignment capabilities (anticipation and integration). After the baby’s arrival, some practices invariably do not work. Parents respond to these misalignments by following one of five paths—differentiated by the capabilities parents build while planning—that result in practice abandonment, vulnerable habituation, or habituation. Our work highlights the challenges associated with translating a social practice into an enacted practice and the corresponding importance of accumulating realignment capabilities during planning. To facilitate habituation of newly adopted practices, how consumers make plans for these practices may ultimately matter more than what they actually plan to do.",Crossref,91.52542372881356,10.1093/jcr/ucz003,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucz003,Goal 16,0.01733295851837523,False,
Regulating Household LeverageReview of Economic Studies,"DeFusco, A. & Johnson, S. & Mondragon, J",2019,,"Abstract This article studies how credit markets respond to policy constraints on household leverage. Exploiting a sharp policy-induced discontinuity in the cost of originating certain high-leverage mortgages, we study how the Dodd–Frank “Ability-to-Repay” rule affected the price and availability of credit in the U.S. mortgage market. Our estimates show that the policy had only moderate effects on prices, increasing interest rates on affected loans by 10–15 basis points. The effect on quantities, however, was significantly larger; we estimate that the policy eliminated 15% of the affected market completely and reduced leverage for another 20% of remaining borrowers. This reduction in quantities is much greater than would be implied by plausible demand elasticities and indicates that lenders responded to the policy not only by raising prices but also by exiting the regulated portion of the market. Heterogeneity in the quantity response across lenders suggests that agency costs may have been one particularly important market friction contributing to the large overall effect as the fall in lending was substantially larger among lenders relying on third-parties to originate loans. Finally, while the policy succeeded in reducing leverage, our estimates suggest this effect would have only slightly reduced aggregate default rates during the housing crisis.",Crossref,81.63265306122449,10.1093/restud/rdz040,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdz040,Goal 2,0.01127319962770919,False,
Psychological reactance as a function of thought versus behavioral controlJournal of Experimental Social Psychology,"Ma, A. & Tang, S. & Kay, A",2019,,"How can people persuade and influence others? One option is to directly target others' behavior through rules and incentives. Another increasingly popular option, however, is to focus on modifying what others think rather than how they behave, and hoping behaviors will then change as a result. The assumption underlying this latter approach is that targeting thoughts and attitudes might be easier or more effective than targeting behaviors. Drawing from psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966), we investigate whether efforts targeted at controlling what people think, rather than how they behave, will indeed be met with differing levels of psychological reactance. Across four studies, we find that people experience greater psychological reactance towards efforts to control their thoughts compared to efforts to control their behaviors. Specifically, thought control, compared to behavioral control, led people to experience greater anger and negativity, and to report lowered motivation to engage in requested behaviors (Study 1). These effects occurred, at least in part, because people perceived that those who try to control their thoughts are likely to try to control their behaviors too, but not vice versa. As a result, thought control elicited greater reactance than behavioral control because the former was perceived as more restrictive than the latter (Studies 2 & 3). We also address other explanations for why thought control may elicit more reactance than behavioral control (Study 4).",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),94.28571428571429,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103118307121,Goal 3,0.01059945664396613,False,

The Effect of Discrete Work Shifts on a Nonterminating Service SystemProduction and Operations Management,"Batt, R. & KC, D. & Staats, B. & Patterson, B",2019,,"Hospital emergency departments (EDs) provide around‐the‐clock medical care, and as such are generally modeled as nonterminating queues. However, from the care provider's point of view, ED care is not a never‐ending process, but rather occurs in discrete work shifts and may require passing unfinished work to the next care provider at the end of the shift. We use data from a large, academic medical center ED to show that the patients’ rate of service completion varies over the course of the physician shift. Furthermore, patients that have experienced a physician handoff have a higher rate of service completion than nonhanded off patients.

Market Reactions to a High-Quality Auditor and Managerial Preference for Audit QualityAuditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory,"Hurley, P. & Mayhew, B",2019,,"SUMMARY We insert an automated high-quality (HQ) auditor into established experimental audit markets to test the impact of high-quality competition on other auditors' supply of and managers' demand for audit quality. Theory predicts that managers will demand high levels of audit quality to avoid investors' price-protecting behavior. This demand should result in the HQ auditor dominating the market and increase other auditors' audit quality provision to compete with the HQ auditor. However, we find that the HQ auditor does not dominate the market—despite holding audit costs constant and investors placing a premium on HQ auditor reports. We also find that adding an HQ auditor results in other auditors lowering audit quality. Additional analyses indicate some managers demand lower audit quality to avoid negative audit reports, consistent with loss aversion as a potential explanation. Our findings indicate a need to develop a more comprehensive theory of the demand for auditing.

The articles are discussed through the prism of design science research that originates in engineering and computer science. In contrast with natural and social sciences that aim to develop and test theories about the world, the objective of design science is to create new artifacts that are useful for solving important practical problems. In audit research, design science methodology was originally used implicitly in early studies devoted to developing and evaluating audit analytical procedures and audit sampling techniques. The recent advances in information technology necessitate renewed attention to this research methodology especially given the profound changes in accounting, auditing, and business processes currently underway.",Crossref,84.02366863905326,10.2308/acch-52459,https://doi.org/10.2308/acch-52459,Goal 17,0.03374782526944678,False,
Realigning Auditors’ Accountability: Experimental EvidenceThe Accounting Review,"Hurley, P. & Mayhew, B. & Obermire, K",2019,,"ABSTRACT We use experimental economic markets to examine the impact of changing institutional design features on audit quality. Specifically, we manipulate auditors' economic accountability to managers by altering who hires the auditor—a manager or an independent third party—and auditors' psychological accountability to investors by explicitly stating that the auditor is hired on the investors' behalf. Our design shifts auditors' accountability from managers, who have directional goal preferences, to investors, who prefer judgment accuracy. We find that removing auditors' economic accountability to managers and replacing it with psychological accountability to investors significantly increases audit quality. This increase in audit quality occurs despite the independent third party randomly hiring auditors. In an additional treatment, we incorporate auditor accuracy into the third-party hiring algorithm and find even higher audit quality. Our results suggest that altering auditors' accountability relationships can significantly enhance audit quality.

Referral Hire Presence Implications for Referrer Turnover and Job Performance,"Trevor, C. & Charlie, T. & Ingo, W. & Dennis, D",2019,,"A great deal of research has been devoted to understanding the organizational returns of employee referral programs, particularly with respect to outcomes involving those hired through the referral process. Yet, no work has addressed whether the presence of a referral hire (i.e., the referred candidate who is hired and working in the firm) is related to behavioral outcomes for the referrer. Drawing on the social enrichment perspective, we theorize how referral hire presence (RHP), which is the time during which the referrer’s and the referral hire’s employment spells overlap, impacts referrer behavior. Using data from 265 referrers in a U.S. call center, we found that RHP was negatively related to referrer voluntary turnover and positively related to referrer job performance. Further, results from a supplemental experimental study supported our social enrichment rationale for the field study relationships, as the construct was associated with both RHP and additional attitudes known to be proximal predictors of turnover and performance. We also explore boundary conditions for the RHP effect in the call center data, revealing a nuanced mix of moderators of RHP effects. Overall, our findings provide the first evidence for the role of social enrichment, possible modifications to the well-established social enrichment perspective in the workplace, and evidence that understanding the impact of referral hiring necessitates careful consideration of the behavioral consequences for the referrer.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/0149206317739959,https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206317739959,Goal 1,0.03210061424581152,False,
Harmful attributions: The role of mind perceptionJournal of Social and Clinical Psychology,"Silva, C. & Tsay, C",2019,,"Introduction: Drawing from literature in social and clinical psychology, we explore mechanisms associated with the lack of empathy for people who engage in self-injurious behaviors.
Methods: Using implicit and explicit measures across three samples, we tested whether knowledge of prior self-injury impacts observers' empathy, perceived agency, perspective taking, and willingness to help a target individual.
Results: We found in Studies 1-2 that observers report decreased empathy, perceive less agency, and make more dispositional attributions toward a person who engages in deliberate self-injury, compared to accidental injury. Study 3 indicates that observers perceive a target who engaged in deliberate self-injury to have lower agency. Furthermore, when evaluating a target who has been victimized, observers report less empathy, compassion, and likelihood of helping if the target has a history of deliberate self-injury. Perceived agency accounted for decreased empathy, whereas empathy accounted for lower likelihood of helping.
Discussion: Our findings imply that observers may be better able to empathize with people with a history of self-injury if they focus on the agency of the indi-vidual and situational causal explanations for the behavior.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),87.35632183908046,,https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2019.38.9.788,Goal 10,0.007543034080441106,False,

First we consider the literature documenting evidence of disproportionate exposure. We particularly consider the implications of modeling choices about spatial relationships between polluters and residents, and about conditioning variables. Next, we evaluate the theory and evidence for four possible mechanisms that may lie behind the patterns seen: disproportionate siting on the firm side, “coming to the nuisance” on the household side, market-like coordination of the two, and discriminatory politics and/or enforcement.

Revealing Corporate Financial MisreportingContemporary Accounting Research,"Curtis, Q. & Donelson, D. & Hopkins, J",2019,,"ABSTRACT This study examines how frequently firms restate when they materially misstate their financial statements using stock option backdating as the setting. Stock option backdating provides a unique opportunity to study this issue because it is possible to estimate misstatements with publicly available information to a high level of confidence, and the extensive media coverage of backdating notified boards of directors of the significant risk of misstatement. After identifying firms that materially misstated earnings due to stock option backdating with 95 percent (99 percent) probability, we find that only 11.5 percent (16.1 percent) of these firms subsequently restated. Restating firms are larger, have greater board independence, higher litigation risk and ROA, a lower market‐to‐book ratio, less discretionary accruals, and are more likely to have a CFO that was not involved in backdating. Restating firms are also more likely to disclose other adverse news, face securities litigation, and turn over the CFO than firms that appear to materially backdate but do not restate. Since nearly 9 of 10 firms failed to restate, our results give pause to researchers who use restatements as an indicator of misreporting, and to regulators who levy penalties on those who do self‐report.",Crossref,81.69014084507043,10.1111/1911-3846.12474,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12474,Goal 10,0.008418097790785131,False,

By “monitoring,” we refer to tracking case progress and obtaining information from the insured (defendant) firm and its counsel prior to case resolution. We find that insurers and lenders increase rates, and that this effect is almost completely isolated to firms with cases that eventually settle. We confirm that this response is reasonable as settled cases are associated with lower future earnings, while there is generally no relation between future earnings and dismissed cases. As direct costs appear low, our results suggest that most costs are indirect in the form of reputational damage. Overall, our results suggest that researchers and policymakers interested in litigation should focus on settled cases, which are the only cases with material long‐term costs.",Crossref,94.61538461538461,10.1111/jori.12231,https://doi.org/10.1111/jori.12231,Goal 17,0.01105579110945008,False,
"M&A Due Diligence, Post-Acquisition Performance, and Financial Reporting for Business Combinations","Wangerin, D",2019,,"ABSTRACT Before completing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions, acquiring firms conduct due diligence. This process provides acquiring firms with a more informed assessment of the expected costs, benefits, and risks of an acquisition and offers one last opportunity to renegotiate or terminate an M&A transaction. However, acquiring firms must trade off the costs and benefits of performing additional due diligence versus completing the acquisition. Based on an analysis of the time to negotiate the acquisition agreement and complete the transaction, I predict and find that competitive pressures, short‐term financial reporting incentives, and agency problems are associated with less due diligence. I also find that less due diligence is associated with lower post‐acquisition profitability, a higher probability of acquisition‐related goodwill impairments, and lower quality fair value estimates for the acquired assets and liabilities. These findings highlight due diligence as an important factor explaining cross‐sectional variation in post‐acquisition performance and financial reporting for business combinations.",Crossref,97.0,10.1111/1911-3846.12520,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12520,Goal 10,0.01952255979271049,False,
Tradeoffs between tax and financial reporting benefits: Evidence from purchase price allocations in taxable acquisitionsContemporary Accounting Research,"Lynch, D. & Romney, M. & Stomberg, B. & Wangerin, D",2019,,"Under U.S. GAAP, firms recognize assets acquired in business combinations at fair value. Similarly, in taxable asset acquisitions firms adjust the tax basis of assets to fair value. Managers can increase the present value of future tax savings by allocating a greater portion of the purchase price to shorter‐lived assets than to goodwill or indefinite‐lived intangibles. However, this tax planning strategy imposes a financial reporting cost because it reduces book income following the acquisition; all else equal, allocations to shorter‐lived depreciable assets increase book depreciation expense, whereas allocations to goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangibles do not increase book amortization expense. We exploit the features of taxable asset acquisitions to investigate trade‐offs between tax and financial reporting incentives. We predict and find greater allocations to depreciable versus intangible assets when managers have strong tax incentives and weak financial reporting incentives. However, we also find that strong financial reporting incentives moderate the effects of strong tax incentives.

In these approaches, therapists analyze religious traditions using not only psychological methodologies (as in the discipline of psychology of religion), but psychotherapeutic theories founded on ideas about health and illness. They thus “therapize” religion. It explicates the work of Franz Alexander and Carl Jung in detail as two early representatives of these approaches - though the two arrived at very different conclusions about the pathological or positive content of Buddhist practice. It further explains that clinicians continue to therapize Buddhist traditions today, often to assess the healthfulness of Buddhist elements before “translating” or “integrating” them into their psychotherapies. This reveals the instability that lies within the relational configurations therapists imagine between the religious and the not-religious when they therapize Buddhist traditions.

The value relevance of managers’ and auditors’ disclosures about material measurement uncertaintyThe Accounting Review,"Dennis, S. & Griffin, J. & Zehms, K",2019,,"ABSTRACT Regulators now require auditors to provide information about how they evaluate complex estimates. Because users encounter this auditor-provided information alongside management-provided information, we jointly examine the value relevance of these disclosures. We also examine whether visual cues in audit reports influence how nonprofessional investors use these disclosures. We find that disclosures from managers and auditors provide different value-relevant information about the same underlying issue. While users struggle to weight fully narrative auditor disclosures in their valuation judgments without corresponding management disclosures, visual cues facilitate their weighting of information about the audit. Specifically, users take increased price protection when auditor disclosures also include visual cues. However, consistent with market signaling theory, corresponding voluntary disclosures from management attenuate this price protection. This suggests management can mitigate negative valuation effects that may arise from auditor disclosures, and implies that visual cues in audit reports can prompt managers to increase disclosure transparency.

Third-Party Reviews and Quality ProvisionManagement Science,"Kim, K. & Chung, K. & Lim, N",2019,,"This paper seeks to understand the relational factors that may affect the decisions of both third-party raters and service providers in a setting where service providers compete with one another. We employ laboratory economics experiments to examine how removing anonymity and allowing for repeated interactions between the rater and the service provider impact both the ratings assigned by the rater and the quality levels expended by the service provider. Our methodology enables us to observe the true quality level chosen by a service provider, which allows us to accurately detect any bias in the assessment of the third-party rater. The experimental results show that the decisions of both the rater and the service provider are very sensitive to the relational factors that govern their interaction. When the rater and the service provider know each other’s identities, we observe a high proportion of overrating even though raters earn less monetary rewards for doing so, and the propensity to overrate is even stronger with repeated interactions. Furthermore, the service provider chooses low quality levels. We develop and estimate a model that captures the rater’s psychological trade-off between remaining objective and helping the service provider compete in the marketplace, and the evolution of the service provider’s beliefs about the rater’s preferences.

A Latent Class Approach to Modeling Trajectories of Health Care Cost in Pediatric Cystic FibrosisMedical Decision Making,"Levy, J. & Rosenberg, M",2019,,"Introduction. Estimating costs of medical care attributable to treatments over time is difficult due to costs that cannot be explained solely by observed risk factors. Unobserved risk factors cannot be accounted for using standard econometric techniques, potentially leading to imprecise prediction. The goal of this work is to describe methodology to account for latent variables in the prediction of longitudinal costs. Methods. Latent class growth mixture models (LCGMMs) predict class membership using observed risk factors and class-specific distributions of costs over time. Our motivating example models cost of care for children with cystic fibrosis from birth to age 17. We compare a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with LCGMMs. Both models use the same covariates and distribution to predict average costs by combinations of observed risk factors. We adopt a Bayesian estimation approach to both models and compare results using the deviance information criterion (DIC). Results. The 3-class LCGMM model has a lower DIC than the GLMM. The LCGMM latent classes include a low-cost group where costs increase slowly over time, a medium-cost group with initial higher costs than the low-cost group and with more rapidly increasing costs at older ages, and a high-cost group with a U-shaped trajectory. The risk profile-specific mixtures of classes are used to predict costs over time. The LCGMM model shows more delineation of costs by age by risk profile and with less uncertainty than the GLMM model. Conclusions. The LCGMM approach creates flexible prediction models when using longitudinal cost data. The Bayesian estimation approach to LCGMM presented fits well into cost-effectiveness modeling where the estimated trajectories and class membership can be used for prediction.",Crossref,95.13513513513513,10.1177/0272989x19859875,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x19859875,Goal 10,0.01575006568959858,False,
Discontinuities in the Value of Relational Capital: The Effects on Employee Entrepreneurship and MobilityOrganization Science,"Byun, H. & Raffiee, J. & Ganco, M",2019,,"We examine how a discontinuous increase in the value of an employee’s relational capital influences the employee’s mobility and entrepreneurship decisions in professional and business service contexts. Drawing on the unfolding model of voluntary turnover, we develop a theory proposing that positive shocks to external relational capital will catalyze employees to consider alternative employment options, thereby increasing the probability of exit. We further maintain that exit decisions in response to such shocks will be driven by a desire to appropriate more value, making these shocks strong predictors of employee entrepreneurship, especially when the employee works in an area that is peripheral to the firm’s core capabilities. Empirically, we construct a unique employee-employer linked database that tracks employment of lobbyists in the United States federal lobbying industry. Leveraging plausibly exogenous shocks to the value of an employee’s relational capital and a novel market-based measure of the employee’s position in the firm’s knowledge space, we report two sets of findings. First, an increase in the value of relational capital has a positive effect on the likelihood of mobility to established firms and employee entrepreneurship, with the effect for the latter stronger than the former. Second, the magnitude of the effect on employee entrepreneurship becomes stronger when the employee is peripheral to the firm’s core knowledge. Together, our results are consistent with a value creation-value appropriation rationale, where sudden increases in the value of an employee’s relational capital drive exit as a means to appropriate a greater portion of value created.",Crossref,95.5223880597015,10.1287/orsc.2018.1262,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2018.1262,Goal 8,0.03030534569150158,False,entrepreneurship

Academic/practical relevance: We contribute to the academic literature on environmental quality competition by explicitly accounting for the credibility of environmental claims made by firms, and by exploring the implications for society of two mechanisms used to remedy credibility-related consumer discounting of firms’ self-declared environmental qualities. We draw parallels between our findings and instances of environmental labeling and regulation from industry to highlight the practical implications of our study. Methodology: We use a game-theoretic framework to analyze a consumer-driven model of green product development. Results: Credibility asymmetry drives product differentiation between two competing firms. The less credible firm always adopts external certification, while the more credible firm does so only if its credibility is sufficiently low. Credibility may also determine whether or not the government should intervene. In the absence of an external certifier, the regulator should intervene by imposing a mandatory environmental standard that is decreasing in stringency as the credibility of the more credible firm increases. In the presence of a certifier, the regulator should intervene if neither firm is sufficiently credible, or if consumers do not value environmental stewardship highly. Managerial implications: We identify how and when government should (and should not) intervene to stimulate green product development when competing firms can use self-labels or external certifications to communicate their environmental performance to consumers.

Challenging the Boundaries of MarketingJournal of Marketing,"Moorman, C. & van Heerde, H. & Moreau, P. & Pamatier , R",2019,,"The technological and digital revolutions experienced over recent decades have fundamentally transformed marketing practice, consumer behavior, and competitive dynamics and presented new policy and societal challenges. At the same time, the world’s many economic, social, and political problems can benefit from proactive, purpose-driven marketing thought. On this stage of dynamic change and unprecedented opportunity, the marketing discipline is poised to offer new knowledge that contributes to the full range of marketing stakeholders, including the students we educate. Despite this potential, a great deal of marketing scholarship remains safely within the confines of its present boundaries— relying on mainstream assumptions, theories, and methods that tend to reinforce, not challenge, our thinking. Like most scientific communities, marketing has the trappings of Kuhn’s (1962, p. 5) “normal science,” which “is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like,” a “willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost,” and a tendency to suppress novelties “subversive of its basic commitments.” There are many reasons for this inertia. Institutional and individual rewards are tilted toward incremental research that safely builds programmatic streams for tenure while a riskaverse journal review process can easily stamp out innovation. Given these forces, many early-career marketing scholars operate within the safe boundaries of the discipline while pledging to return to innovative opportunities in the later stages of their careers. Unfortunately, most never do. It is within this context that we introduce a series of innovative articles designed to inform and inspire research that broadens the current boundaries of marketing, including the phenomena, theories, methods, and findings the field considers important and interesting. Articles in this series include conceptual reexaminations that challenge assumptions in wellestablished research areas. These articles do so by questioning current boundaries and offering fresh research agendas. Other articles highlight new challenges to the field by offering conceptual frameworks to structure new research approaches with the potential to transform the discipline. The first of these “Challenging the Boundaries of Marketing” articles appears in the current issue and focuses on “Marketing in the Sharing Economy” (Eckhardt et al. 2019). We asked this team of authors to investigate the changing nature of marketing in the sharing economy—a critical perspective that has been missing from most research published in marketing journals. Defining the sharing economy as a scalable socioeconomic system that employs technology-enabled platforms to provide users with temporary access to tangible and intangible resources that may be crowdsourced, the paper examines how the sharing economy forces us to rethink three foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, brands, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society). Importantly, the article offers wide-ranging future research opportunities that confront the boundaries of marketing thought. These authors, Giana Eckhardt, Mark Houston, Baojun Jiang, Cait Lamberton, Aric Rindfleisch, and Georgios Zervas, examine the sharing economy from remarkably diverse perspectives and methodological approaches, representing marketing strategy, empirical modeling, analytic modeling, mainstream consumer research, and consumer cultural theory. This interdisciplinary perspective reinforces the Journal of Marketing’s (JM’s) position as the discipline’s broadest and most inclusive journal and reflects our view that the discipline will be stronger when we unite to solve the field’s most pressing questions and problems.

The first model studies an environment in which agents meet bilaterally and lack commitment, which allows money to be valued endogenously as means of payment. In this setup both goods and money are indivisible to keep things tractable. Second-generation models relax the assumption of indivisible goods and use bargaining theory (or related mechanisms) to endogenize prices. Variations of these models are applied to financial asset markets and intermediation.

As a leading example, news can be announcements about monetary policy directions. In three standard theoretical environments—an overlapping generations model of fiat currency, a new monetarist model accommodating multiple payment methods, and a model of unsecured credit—transition paths are constructed between an announcement and the date at which events are realized. Although the economics is different, in each case, news about monetary policy can induce volatility in financial and other markets, with transitions displaying booms, crashes, and cycles in prices, quantities, and welfare. This is not the same as volatility based on self-fulfilling prophecies (e.g., cyclic or sunspot equilibria) studied elsewhere. Instead, the focus is on the unique equilibrium that is stationary when parameters are constant but still delivers complicated dynamics in simple environments due to information and liquidity effects. This is true even for classically-neutral policy changes. The induced volatility can be bad or good for welfare, but using policy to exploit this in practice seems difficult because outcomes are very sensitive to timing and parameters.

The role of value in the attentional boost effectQuarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,"Swallow, K. & Atir, S",2019,,"Focusing attention on one item typically interferes with the ability to process other information. Yet, target detection can both facilitate memory for items paired with the target (the attentional boost effect) and increase the perceived value of those items (cued approach). Because long-term memory is better for valuable items than for neutral items, we asked whether the attentional boost effect is due to changes in the perceived value of items that are paired with targets. In three experiments, participants memorised a series of briefly presented images that depicted valuable (e.g., food) or neutral (e.g., children’s toys) items. Whenever an item appeared, a square flashed in its centre. Participants pressed a button if the square was a target colour but not if it was a distractor colour. Consistent with previous research, target-paired items were remembered better than distractor-paired items and were rated as more valuable.

Hospital Prices Grew Substantially Faster Than Physician Prices For Hospital-Based Care In 2007–14Health Affairs,"Cooper, Z. & Craig, S. & Gaynor, M. & Harish, N. & Krumholz, H. & Van Reenan, J",2019,,"Evidence suggests that growth in providers' prices drives growth in health care spending on the privately insured.

We found that in the period 2007-14 hospital prices grew substantially faster than physician prices. For inpatient care, hospital prices grew 42 percent, while physician prices grew 18 percent.

Disrupting Unwanted Habits in Online Gambling Through Information TechnologyJournal of Management Information Systems,"Hou, J. & Kim, K. & Kim, S. & Ma, X",2019,,"Abstract The instant access to gambling anytime, anywhere, has made online gambling highly habitual for some people. As a result, some online gamblers choose to volitionally enable the website-provided disruptive information technology (IT) features to control their gambling routines. The objective of this study is to examine the role of these features in regulating online gambling behavior. It is worthwhile to note that in this research, we do not make the assumption that habitual or regular online gambling is a bad thing; nor does the development of our conceptual framework — which focuses on the effect of disruptive IT features and moderating roles of individual regularity and game type in modifying gambling routines — depend on such an assumption. Drawing on theories of habitual automaticity and habit disruption, the conceptual framework theorizes the efficacy and mechanism of disruptive features while taking into account heterogeneity in individual regularity and game type. We tested the model using data collected over 10 years from 3,526 users of a gambling website. First, we found that individuals’ repetitive gambling patterns weakened as the duration of exposure to disruptive features increased. Second, the behavior of more regular gamblers was more resistant to the disruptive features, because more regular gamblers exhibited a stronger habitual pattern. Third, disruptive features were less effective on sports games compared with casino games, because sports gamblers tended to exhibit stronger gambling routines. Overall, the present study contributes to the information systems (IS) literature by clarifying how simple IT features may disrupt unwanted and difficult-to-break online gambling habits as judged by the gamblers. Our findings are likeliest to apply to broader areas of online services in which the application in question is integrated into everyday life and the system can offer a disruptive mechanism.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),92.19858156028369,10.1080/07421222.2019.1661088,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ebf27a61ee07639ec2996bb2057c096559cefb00,Goal 17,0.01408720556552258,False,

This connection is the direct result of China’s central government reforms to its fiscal system that have encouraged local governments to rely on land sales and development to fund required infrastructure projects. Since China does not allow local governments to directly participate in the municipal bond market, these governments rely on a unique funding mechanism known as Local Government Financing Vehicle (LGFV). We study the linkage between the solvency of local government debt and local housing market risk. Our results indicate that areas with higher expected house price growth issue debt with lower risk premiums. Furthermore, bonds issued by LGFVs from areas that experience greater changes in housing prices have a corresponding decline in observed yield spreads.

"Not good, not bad: Unpacking the Effect of Family Control on Environmental Performance Disclosure by Business Group FirmsJournal of Business Ethics","Terlaak, A. & Kim, S. & Roh, T",2018,,"We combine research on business groups with the socioemotional wealth approach from family firm research to examine how family control of business group firms affects voluntary disclosure of environmental performance information. Theorizing that disclosing environmental performance information weakens the owner’s control over the firm but also generates reputational benefits, we expect family ownership and disclosure propensities to relate in a U-shaped way and, further, that this U-shape is accentuated for firms with a family CEO. Analysis of longitudinal data on disclosure decisions of South Korean business group firms supports our theory. Results show that when family ownership is low to moderate, concerns about disclosure weakening control causes disclosure propensities to decrease. However, for firms with a family CEO, potential reputational benefits begin to outweigh these disclosure costs once a certain level of ownership is reached, leading subsequent disclosure propensities to increase. Findings highlight that the effect of family control on environmental performance disclosure is neither good nor bad; instead, it depends on both the level of family ownership and whether a family CEO is in place. Furthermore, our finding that disclosure propensities are greatest for business group firms that combine high levels of family ownership with a family CEO is provocative in that it suggests that the very element that often is seen to encourage inefficiencies and fraud– family ownership combined with family leadership–can also foster responsible behaviors.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),94.25287356321839,,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMBPP.2017.11621abstract,Goal 3,0.02116807871796232,False,

Design Retrospective electronic record review. Setting Academic medical center ED. Participants Individuals aged 65 and older seen in the ED from January 1, 2013, through September 30, 2015. Measurements We evaluated the utility of routinely collected Hendrich II fall risk scores in predicting ED visits for a fall within 6 months of an all‐cause index ED visit. Results For in‐network patient visits resulting in discharge with a completed Hendrich II score (N = 4,366), the return rate for a fall within 6 months was 8.3%. When applying the score alone to predict revisit for falls among the study population the resultant receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64. In a univariate model, the odds of returning to the ED for a fall in 6 months were 1.23 times as high for every 1‐point increase in Hendrich II score (odds ratio (OR)=1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.19–1.28). When included in a model with other potential confounders or predictors of falls, the Hendrich II score is a significant predictor of a return ED visit for fall (adjusted OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.10–1.20, AUC=0.75). Conclusion Routinely collected Hendrich II scores were correlated with outpatient falls, but it is likely that they would have little utility as a stand‐alone fall risk screen. When combined with easily extractable covariates, the screen performs much better.

In subsequent studies, we find that when required to choose between two harmful actions, people prefer the action that saves more lives, despite its being more aversive.

Auditor Monitoring and Verification in Financial Contracts: Evidence from Earnouts and SFAS 141RReview of Accounting Studies,"Allee, K. & Wangerin, D",2018,,"We study how monitoring and verification of accounting-based performance benchmarks influences the design and efficiency of earnout contracts. Earnouts are commonly used to resolve agency conflicts arising in mergers and acquisitions, but these contracts create measurement and other agency problems when contingent payments are tied to future accounting-based performance. Exploiting changes in auditor monitoring of earnouts that arose as\ a consequence of SFAS 141(R), we find that acquisition contracts are more likely to incorporate accounting-based earnouts and that contingent payments tied to accounting-based performance benchmarks make up a larger portion of the consideration when acquiring firms have high-quality auditors. We also find that market reactions to announcements of earnout deals are more positive after SFAS 141(R) for acquisitions most susceptible to disputes over accounting-based performance metrics and these results are more pronounced for acquiring firms with high-quality auditors.

““Ten dams for one delta seen from Space”: Envisioning Environmentalism in Nadine Gordimer’s Get a Life,"Bourg Hacker, D",2018,,"While South African environmental activism has progressed and blossomed substantially since the 1990s, there still is no popular unified environmental movement. Some critics, such as Carl Death argue the lack of unification makes it difficult to address environmental grievances. Nadine Gordimer’s Get a Life responds to this environmental problematic. Weaving in and out of the Bannerman family’s thoughts, Get a Life explores what ecology and environmentalism can mean in South Africa when it is visualized from a suburban, middle-class, well-meaning male point of view. This paper examines the way the novel portrays vision, omission, and invisibility. By exploring Get a Life’s motif of vision, I show that the three visions portrayed (above, below, and on the ground) all highlight distance—distance that makes it difficult to overcome borders and imagine communities, even as the ecologist voices concerns about problematic land redistribution and the effects of consumer capitalism. Privileging the visual makes black communities, and the environmental violence they suffer, invisible.

When Do Auditors Use Specialists’ Work to Improve Problem Representations of and Judgments about Complex Estimates?The Accounting Review,"Griffith, E",2018,,"ABSTRACT Auditors are more likely to identify misstatements in complex estimates if they recognize problematic patterns among an estimate's underlying assumptions. Rich problem representations aid pattern recognition, but auditors likely have difficulty developing them given auditors' limited domain-specific expertise in this area. In two experiments, I predict and find that a relational cue in a specialist's work highlighting aggressive assumptions improves auditors' problem representations and subsequent judgments about estimates. However, this improvement only occurs when a situational factor (e.g., risk) increases auditors' epistemic motivation to incorporate the cue into their problem representations. These results suggest that auditors do not always respond to cues in specialists' work. More generally, this study highlights the role of situational factors in increasing auditors' epistemic motivation to develop rich problem representations, which contribute to high-quality audit judgments in this and other domains where pattern recognition is important.",Crossref,90.83665338645419,10.2308/accr-51926,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51926,Goal 17,0.007174990433644055,False,
Promoting Change from the Outside: Directing Managerial Attention in the Implementation of Environmental ImprovementsManagement Science,"Dhanokar, S. & Siemsen, E. & Linderman, K",2018,,"Regulatory agencies, auditing firms, and supply chain partners externally promote change in firms. To this end, they commonly employ two different and somewhat contradictory intervention approaches. One approach uses punitive tactics to coerce firms to change, while the other approach uses supportive tactics to encourage change. Using the context of government agencies promoting environmental improvements in firms, we examine whether such punitive (e.g., regulatory inspections with possible sanctions) and supportive (e.g., environmental assistance, improvement recommendations) tactics can be administered in a complementary manner. Using a unique and novel longitudinal data set collected from two state-level environmental agencies in Minnesota, we analyze over 1,000 supportive environmental improvement (EI) projects in combination with intermittent (but currently uncoordinated) punitive tactics. One key finding from our research is that the timing, severity, and relatedness of punitive tactics is critical for directing managerial attention and thus improving the efficacy of supportive tactics (i.e., EI implementation). Contingent on their timing, inspections can increase EI implementation rates by up to 60% but can also reduce implementation rates by up to 50% compared with EIs in facilities that do not experience inspections. Classifying regulatory inspections as (1) either clean or adverse and (2) either related or unrelated allows us to further explain the influence of such punitive tactics on EI implementation. Finally, we provide evidence for a positive effect of successful EI implementation on long-term environmental compliance. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2748 .

In this study, we review recent research about using MTurk for behavioral experiments and test the validity of using MTurk for experiments in behavioral operations management. We recruited subjects from MTurk to replicate the inventory management experiment from Bolton and Katok ( 2008 ), as well as the procurement auction experiment from Engelbrecht‐Wiggans and Katok ( 2008 ), and the supply chain contracting experiment from Loch and Wu ( 2008 ). We successfully replicate individual biases in the inventory management and procurement auction experiments, but learning in the individual tasks occurs more slowly on MTurk compared to the original studies. Further, we find that social preference manipulations in the supply chain experiment are ineffective in changing the behavior of MTurk subjects, in contrast to the original study. We conducted an additional replication study of the supply chain contracting experiment using student subjects in a standard laboratory. Results from this laboratory replication also fail to replicate the original laboratory study, indicating that the effect of social preferences on supply chain contracting may not be robust to alternative subject pools. We conclude that factors potentially influencing the differences observed on MTurk are less related to the online environment, but more related to the diversity and characteristics of subject pool on MTurk. Overall, MTurk appears to be an important and relevant tool for researchers in behavioral operations, but we caution researchers about slower learning of the MTurk subjects and the use of social preference manipulations on MTurk.",Crossref,83.87096774193549,10.1111/poms.12841,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12841,Goal 1,0.01942662957345659,False,

Participants also believed their money—in the form of donations, taxes, fines, and fees—would help charities and governments more than others’ money. We tested six mechanisms based on psychological distance, the endowment effect, wishful thinking, better-than-average biases, pain of payment, and beliefs about product preferences. Only a psychological distance mechanism received support. Specifically, we found that the perceived purchasing power of other people’s money decreased logarithmically as others’ psychological distance from the self increased, consistent with psychological distance’s subadditive property. Further supporting a psychological distance mechanism, we found that framing one’s own money as distant (vs. near) reduced the self-other difference in perceived purchasing power.

Our data set on nearly 100,000 patients spans from 2008 to 2013, which includes the rollout and diffusion of e-visits in the health system we study.

In Study 1, we demonstrate this relationship in a field study with short-haul truck drivers where we combine survey responses with lagged archival data on preventable accidents. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in financial worry is associated with a 0.4% increase in the probability of a preventable accident because of its detrimental effects on cognitive capacity.

Property Lines in the Mind: Consumers’ Psychological Ownership and Their Territorial ResponsesJournal of Consumer Research,"Kirk, C. & Peck, J. & Swain, S",2018,,"Abstract Psychological ownership, or the feeling that something is mine, has garnered growing attention in marketing. While previous work focuses on the positive aspects of psychological ownership, this research draws attention to the darker side of psychological ownership—territorial behavior. Results of five experimental studies demonstrate that when consumers feel psychological ownership of a target, they are prone to perceptions of infringement and subsequent territorial responses when they infer that another individual feels ownership of the same target. Potential infringers are held less accountable when they acknowledge ownership prior to engaging in otherwise threatening behaviors, and when they could not be expected to know that a target is owned, as it was not clearly marked. In addition, high narcissists are subject to a psychological ownership metaperception bias, and are thus more apt than low narcissists to perceive infringement. A multitude of territorial responses are documented for both tangible (coffee, sweater, chair, pizza) and intangible (a design) targets of ownership. Further, consumers infer the psychological ownership of others from signals of the antecedents of psychological ownership: control, investment of self, and intimate knowledge.

We develop a non‐constraining, easily implementable behavioral debias technique to help mitigate this tendency in demand forecasting and inventory decision‐making settings. The debiasing technique has individuals record estimates of demand outcomes (REDO): participants explicitly record a self‐generated estimate of every demand realization, allowing them to record a different value than the number of sales in periods with stockouts. In doing so, they construct a more representative sample of demand realizations (that differs from the sales sample). In three laboratory experiments with MBA and undergraduate students, this remedy significantly reduces downward bias in demand beliefs under censorship and leads to higher inventory order decisions.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),93.82716049382717,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12823,Goal 5,0.008883693362294255,False,

If people are naive to this structural feature, then they will tend to have erroneously inflated expectations for the alternatives they choose. In contrast to theories of motivated reasoning, this theory suggests that individuals will overestimate chosen alternatives even before they make their choice. In four studies, we found that students and managers exhibited behavior consistent with naïveté toward this relationship between estimation error and choice, leaving them overoptimistic about their chosen alternatives.

Deming proposed that firms may improve quality through comparative performance assessment with outside industries. This study is modeled after research conducted by Nembhard and Edmondson (2006) to determine whether significant organizational findings from the healthcare industry are reproducible in the financial services industry. This study used a multivariate, experimental design to examine the relationship of professional status and psychological safety on organizational citizenship behavior outcomes, while incorporating the moderating effect of leader inclusiveness. 247 current financial services professionals participated in this study.

The results of the study indicate that professional status influences perceptions of psychological safety and is moderated by leader inclusiveness. The results also confirm that leader inclusiveness has a direct influence on OCB-voice and that psychological safety directly mediates OCB helping and organizational commitment outcomes.

A Transparent and Consistent Approach to Assess US Outpatient Drug Costs for Use in Cost-Effectiveness AnalysesValue in Health,"Levy, J. & Rosenberg, M. & Vanness, D",2018,,"BackgroundAssessment of drug costs for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in the United States is not straightforward because the prices paid for drugs are not publicly available and differ between payers. CEAs have relied on list prices that do not reflect the rebates and discounts known to be associated with these purchases.ObjectivesTo review available cost measures and propose a novel strategy that is transparent, consistent, and applicable to all CEAs taking a US health care sector perspective or a societal payer’s perspective.MethodsWe propose using the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC), the Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (VAFSS), and their midpoint as the upper bound, lower bound, and base case, respectively, to estimate net drug prices for various payers. We compare this approach with wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), the most common measure observed in our literature review. The minimum WAC is used to provide the most conservative comparison.ResultsOur sample consists of 1436 brand drugs and 1599 generic drugs. On average, the upper bound (NADAC) is 1% and 9.8% lower than the WAC for brand and generic drugs respectively, whereas the lower bound (VAFSS) is 48.3% and 54.2% lower than the WAC. The NADAC is less than the WAC in 89.6% of drug groups. The distributions of these relationships do not show a clear mode and have wide variation.ConclusionsOur study suggests that the WAC may be an overestimate for the base case because the minimum WAC is higher than the NADAC for most drugs.

Strategic Human Capital Management in the Context of Cross-Industry and Within-Industry Mobility FrictionsStrategic Management Journal,"Starr, E. & Ganco, M. & Campbell, B",2018,,"Research Summary : We develop and test a theory examining how frictions that restrict mobility across industries and frictions constraining mobility within an industry can co‐occur to effectively isolate individual human capital, ultimately changing the firm's make‐versus‐buy decision for human capital. Empirically, we demonstrate that when cross‐industry frictions in the form of limited skill transferability and within‐industry frictions in the form of noncompete enforceability are both present, employees exhibit longer tenures, firms hire workers with less initial experience, firms change the amount and nature of training provided, and wages marginally increase. These findings suggest that sufficiently strong and complementary mobility frictions shift the emphasis of firms’ human capital management practices toward internal development of human capital relative to acquisition on the external market. Managerial Summary : In the face of frictions to employee mobility both within and across industries, which we capture empirically using measures of noncompete enforceability and limited skill transferability across industries, firms tend to hire less experienced workers, such workers exhibit longer tenures, and firms invest more in their training, particularly in the development of new skills. Our findings imply that for firms operating under such complementary frictions, better hiring and internal development capabilities are particularly important for performance, while those firms without such capabilities may benefit from considering ways to circumvent the mobility frictions, including moving out of the focal state or lobbying for different noncompete laws.",Crossref,82.09606986899564,10.1002/smj.2906,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2906,Goal 17,0.01889462267356792,False,

"Strategic Goal Accomplishment in Export Ventures: The Role of Capabilities, Knowledge, and EnvironmentJournal of the Academy of Marketing Science","Spyropoulou, S. & Katsikeas, C. & Skarmeas, D. & Morgan, N",2018,,"The management literature suggests that setting strategic goals facilitates the identification of appropriate business strategies and focuses management attention and available resources on their accomplishment, enabling subsequent goal realization. Yet the literature also indicates that firms often find it difficult to realize their strategic goals and may find it even more challenging to do so when operating in foreign markets. However, little is known empirically about the extent to which strategic goals enable desired strategic positions to be achieved and factors that may affect this relationship. We examine this important issue using primary data from a sample of exporting manufacturers. Results support the existence of previously theorized strategic goal–realized strategic position gaps and show that these negatively impact performance. Thus, simply setting strategic goals does not necessarily aid in accomplishing the desired outcomes, and any failure to do so is costly. Drawing on organization theory, we find that internal capabilities and knowledge, and external market factors play important roles in minimizing such strategic goal–realized strategic position gaps. Specifically, we show that businesses with stronger architectural capabilities, those with higher levels of internationalization, and those operating in less dynamic market environments are better able to realize their intended strategic objectives and thereby enjoy superior performance.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),79.66804979253112,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-017-0519-8,Goal 17,0.0148848100800864,False,

We find that market size uncertainty creates or increases the quantity differential, but it does not affect the differential’s polarity. In contrast, market size uncertainty decreases the quality differential and it does so to the extent that, depending on the level of consumer heterogeneity, it reverses the differential’s polarity.

Pair copula constructions for insurance experience ratingJournal of the American Statistical Association,"Shi, P. & Yang, L",2018,,"In nonlife insurance, insurers use experience rating to adjust premiums to reflect policyholders’ previous claim experience. Performing prospective experience rating can be challenging when the claim distribution is complex. For instance, insurance claims are semicontinuous in that a fraction of zeros is often associated with an otherwise positive continuous outcome from a right-skewed and long-tailed distribution. Practitioners use credibility premium that is a special form of the shrinkage estimator in the longitudinal data framework. However, the linear predictor is not informative especially when the outcome follows a mixed distribution. In this article, we introduce a mixed vine pair copula construction framework for modeling semicontinuous longitudinal claims. In the proposed framework, a two-component mixture regression is employed to accommodate the zero inflation and thick tails in the claim distribution. The temporal dependence among repeated observations is modeled using a sequence of bivariate conditional copulas based on a mixed D-vine. We emphasize that the resulting predictive distribution allows insurers to incorporate past experience into future premiums in a nonlinear fashion and the classic linear predictor can be viewed as a nested case. In the application, we examine a unique claims dataset of government property insurance from the state of Wisconsin. Due to the discrepancies between the claim and premium distributions, we employ an ordered Lorenz curve to evaluate the predictive performance. We show that the proposed approach offers substantial opportunities for separating risks and identifying profitable business when compared with alternative experience rating methods.

Sequential Sampling Enhanced Composite Likelihood Approach to Estimation of Social Intercorrelations in Large-scale NetworksQuantitative Marketing and Economics,"Chen, Y. & Qi, Y. & Liu, Q. & Chien, P",2018,,"The increasing access to large social network data has generated substantial interest in the marketing community. However, due to its large scale, traditional analysis methods often become inadequate. In this paper, we propose a sequential sampling enhanced composite likelihood approach for efficient estimation of social intercorrelations in large-scale networks using the spatial model. Given a known population network, the proposed approach sequentially takes small samples from the network, and adaptively improves model parameter estimates through learnings obtained from previous samples. In comparison to population-based maximum likelihood estimation that is computationally prohibitive when the network size is large, the proposed approach makes it computationally feasible to analyze large networks and provide efficient estimation of social intercorrelations among members in large networks. In comparison to sample-based estimation that relies on information purely from the sample and produces underestimation bias in social intercorrelation estimates, the proposed approach effectively uses information from the population without compromising computation efficiency. Through simulation studies based on simulated networks and real networks, we demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed approach over benchmark estimation methods and discuss managerial implications.

Collateral Damage: The Impact of Mortgage Debt on U,"Tunc, C. & Yavas, A",2017,,"This article contributes to the literature on saving by empirically investigating the determinants of the saving rate in the United States, with a special focus on the role of mortgage debt. Using data from 1987 to 2013, we find that mortgage payments have a substantial negative impact on both personal and private saving rates in the United States. An increase of 10 percentage points in mortgage payments leads to a 9.1-percentage-point drop in the personal saving rate and a 12.4-percentage-point drop in the private saving rate. In addition, including mortgage debt as an explanatory variable leads to significant changes in the impact of other variables, which further reinforces our claim that mortgage debt is important for the analysis of the saving rate. Comparing mortgage payments with nonmortgage consumer debt payments, we find that mortgage payments have a larger impact on the private saving rate whereas nonmortgage consumer debt payments have a larger impact on the personal saving rate. We also find a partial but robust crowding-out effect of public saving rate on the two saving rates.

A review and simulation of business angel investment returnsVenture Capital: An International Journal of Finance,"Bock, A. & Gregson, G. & Harrison, R",2017,,"Business angels are widely recognized as a significant source of entrepreneurial finance, particularly for early-stage businesses. However, rigorous investigation on angel investment performance has been limited. This paper examines investment returns of business angels in addressing the question of whether angel investing generates attractive returns. We review the few published studies which report on more than 100 investment exits to establish baseline returns expectations and clarify returns measurement limitations. We then use data from one of the largest studies of angel returns to populate a Monte Carlo simulation of returns profiles to explore the link between portfolio size and the probability of the desired level of returns. The study reveals that angel deal returns are highly skewed; smaller portfolios have higher average returns but dramatically lower median returns. In contrast with prior studies, our study shows that portfolios with more than 50 investments are required to significantly minimize risk of poor returns and that similar scale is required to maximize returns potential, as smaller portfolios have a lower average internal rate of return (IRR). We show that reinvestment rate is a critical element in measuring angel returns, and we demonstrate the limitations of IRR as a returns metric through the simulation.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),92.85714285714286,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691066.2017.1332546,Goal 17,0.005870473038714004,False,
Coping with Uncertainty: entrepreneurial sensemaking in regenerative medicine venturingJournal of Technology Transfer,"Johnson, D. & Bock, A",2017,,"Entrepreneurs face multiple sources and types of uncertainty during venturing activity. Converting novel or speculative opportunities into viable commercial businesses requires entrepreneurs to address or even leverage uncertainty. This process is especially relevant in nascent, knowledge-intensive fields, where success likely hinges on acquisition and deployment of unique, specialized knowledge resources. Venture development will be partly determined by the sensemaking strategies entrepreneurs employ to cope with irreducible uncertainty, especially as they seek critical collaborations. The regenerative medicine (RM) sector represents a unique context for studying entrepreneurial sensemaking under high levels of uncertainty. We consider how uncertainty in RM venturing affects entrepreneurial behavior. Informed by long-form narrative interviews, we propose a sensemaking model linking uncertainty, university culture, coping and narratives of venture potential in the RM field. This helps explain how participants in the RM sector cope with uncertainty and explore knowledge partnerships.

Platform Integration and Demand Spillovers in Complementary Markets: Evidence from Facebook’s Integration of InstagramManagement Science,"Li, Z. & Agarwal, A",2017,,"Social media platform owners often choose to provide tighter integration with their own complementary applications (i.e., first-party applications) as compared to that with other complementary third-party applications. We study the impact of such integration on consumer demand for first-party applications and competing third-party applications by exploring Facebook’s integration of Instagram, an application in its photo-sharing application ecosystem. We find that consumers obtain additional value from Instagram after its integration with Facebook, leading to a large increase in the use of Instagram for Facebook photo sharing. Further, we find that the growth of Instagram’s user base has a positive spillover effect on big third-party applications and a negative spillover effect on small third-party applications in Facebook’s photo-sharing ecosystem. As a result, while small third-party applications face reduced demand after integration, big third-party applications experience a small increase in demand. Thus, the overall demand for the entire photo-sharing application ecosystem actually increases, which suggests that Facebook’s integration strategy benefits the complementary market overall. Our results highlight the role of platform integration for first-party applications and the application ecosystem overall, and they have implications for strategic management of first-party applications in the presence of third-party applications.

In the model, a borrower institution obtains funds from a large institutional lender and small investors. When the large lender's asset market is hit by a liquidity shock, it might decide to withdraw funding extended to the borrower. The potential withdrawal by the large lender causes small investors to panic and to close positions even if the large lender does not. Facing funding problems, the borrower has to cut its activities, contributing to further shocks to the supply of market liquidity. The original shock is exacerbated, which reinforces withdrawals by all creditors.

Extensively studied in the field of psychology, cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks, hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case (Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.",Semantic Scholar,30.06535947712419,10.48550/arXiv.2509.22856,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e8a418e7a423063bf0de29c89e5c3ca3aa7f98b5,Goal 5,0.01521654972222665,False,

Using operational data from more than 140,000 patient visits to a hospital emergency department, we show that the system-level performance of the emergency department is an aggregation of several simultaneous server-level workload response mechanisms. We identify early task initiation as a between-stage adaptive response mechanism that occurs when an upstream stage initiates tasks that are normally handled by a downstream stage. We show that having some diagnostic tests ordered during the triage process reduces treatment time by 20 minutes, on average. However, ordering too many tests at triage can lead to an increase in the total number of tests performed on the patient.

The Impact of Emergency Department Census on the Decision to AdmitAcademic Emergency Medicine,"Gorsky, J. & Batt, R. & Otles, E. & Shah, M. & Hamedani, A. & Patterson, B",2017,,"Abstract Objective We evaluated the effect of emergency department ( ED ) census on disposition decisions made by ED physicians. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis using 18 months of all adult patient encounters seen in the main ED at an academic tertiary care center. Patient census information was calculated at the time of physician assignment for each individual patient and included the number of patients in the waiting room (waiting room census) and number of patients being managed by the patient's attending (physician load census). A multiple logistic regression model was created to assess the association between these census variables and the disposition decision, controlling for potential confounders including Emergency Severity Index acuity, patient demographics, arrival hour, arrival mode, and chief complaint. Results A total of 49,487 patient visits were included in this analysis, of whom 37% were admitted to the hospital. Both census measures were significantly associated with increased chance of admission; the odds ratio ( OR ) per patient increase for waiting room census was 1.011 (95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.001 to 1.020), and the OR for physician load census was 1.010 (95% CI = 1.002 to 1.019). To put this in practical terms, this translated to a modeled rise from 35.3% to 40.1% when shifting from an empty waiting room and zero patient load to a 12‐patient wait and 16‐patient load for a given physician. Conclusion Waiting room census and physician load census at time of physician assignment were positively associated with the likelihood that a patient would be admitted, controlling for potential confounders.

Creating Reciprocal Value Through Operational TransparencyManagement Science,"Buell, R. & Kim, T. & Tsay, C",2017,,"We investigate whether organizations can create value by introducing visual transparency between consumers and producers. Although operational transparency has been shown to improve consumer perceptions of service value, existing theory posits that increased contact between consumers and producers may diminish work performance. Two field and two laboratory experiments in food service settings suggest that transparency that (1) allows customers to observe operational processes (process transparency) and (2) allows employees to observe customers (customer transparency) not only improves customer perceptions but also increases service quality and efficiency. The introduction of this transparency contributed to a 22.2% increase in customer-reported quality and reduced throughput times by 19.2%. Laboratory studies revealed that customers who observed process transparency perceived greater employee effort and thus were more appreciative of the employees and valued the service more. Employees who observed customer transparency felt that their work was more appreciated and more impactful and thus were more satisfied with their work and more willing to exert effort. We find that transparency, by visually revealing operating processes to consumers and beneficiaries to producers, generates a positive feedback loop through which value is created for both parties.

Task Decomposition and Newsvendor Decision MakingManagement Science,"Lee, Y. & Siemsen, E",2017,,"We conduct three behavioral laboratory experiments to compare newsvendor order decisions placed directly to order decisions submitted in a decomposed way by soliciting point forecasts, uncertainty estimates, and service-level decisions. Decomposing order decisions in such a way often follows from organizational structure and can lead to performance improvements compared with ordering directly. However, we also demonstrate that if the critical ratio is below 50%, or if the underlying demand uncertainty is too high, task decomposition may not be preferred to direct ordering. Under such conditions, decision makers are prone to set service levels too high or to suffer from excessive random judgment error, which reduces the efficacy of task decomposition. We further demonstrate that if accompanied by decision support in the form of suggested quantities, task decomposition becomes the better-performing approach to newsvendor decision making more generally. Decision support and task decomposition therefore appear as complementary methods to improve decision performance in the newsvendor context.

Do Plant Inspections Predict Future Quality? The Role of Investigator ExperienceManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Ball, G. & Siemsen, E. & Shah, R",2017,,"Plant inspections enable firms to manage their quality risk in global supply chains. However, surprisingly little research examines the relationship between such inspections and future product quality. In this paper, we study how well plant inspection outcomes predict the hazard of a future recall and analyze how investigator experience affects this predictive relationship. Using secondary data spanning a seven-year period in the medical device industry and a recurrent-event Cox proportional hazard model, our analysis shows that inspection outcomes reliably predict future product recalls. However, inspection outcomes become an unreliable predictor of recalls with an increase in site-specific investigator experience. Through post hoc analysis, we also show that the hazard of a recall at a plant increases with site-specific experience, independent of the inspection outcome. Compared to the first visit by an investigator, the recall hazard increases by 21% the second time the investigator visits a specific plant, and by 57% on the third visit.

Akin to mere ownership, which describes people liking their possessions more merely because they own them, we tested a complementary prediction: whether people like their possessions more merely because others own them too. Thus, in a departure from previous work, we examined a type of similarity based on two people sharing the same material item. We find that this type of sharing causes gift recipients to like their gifts more, and feel closer to gift givers.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),92.92929292929293,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217718525,Goal 11,0.003325911899031318,False,

A behavioral model of forecasting: Naive statistics on mental samplesManagement Science,"Tong, J. & Feiler, D",2017,,"Most operations models assume individuals make decisions based on a perfect understanding of random variables or stochastic processes. In reality, however, individuals are subject to cognitive limitations and make systematic errors. We leverage established psychology on sample naivete to model individuals’ forecasting errors and biases in a way that is portable to operations models. The model has one behavioral parameter and embeds perfect rationality as a special case. We use the model to mathematically characterize point and error forecast behavior, reflecting an individual’s beliefs about the mean and variance of a random variable. We then derive 10 behavioral phenomena that are inconsistent with perfect rationality assumptions but supported by existing empirical evidence. Finally, we apply the model to two operations settings, inventory management and queuing, to illustrate the model’s portability and discuss its numerous predictions. For inventory management, we characterize order decisions assuming behavioral demand forecasting. The model predicts that even under automated cost optimization, one should expect a pull-to-center effect. It also predicts that this effect can be mitigated by separating point forecasting from error forecasting. For base stock models, it predicts that safety stocks are too small (large) for short (long) lead times. We also express the steady-state behavior of a queue with balking, assuming rational joining decisions but behavioral wait-time forecasts. The model predicts that joining customers tend to be disappointed in their experienced waits. Also, for long (short) lines, it predicts customers have more (less) disperse wait-time beliefs and tend to overestimate (underestimate) the true wait-time variance.

Choose to Lose: Health Plan Choices From a Menu With Dominated OptionsQuarterly Journal of Economics,"Bhargava, S. & Loewenstein, G. & Sydnor, J",2017,,"Abstract We examine the health plan choices that 23,894 employees at a U.S. firm made from a large menu of options that differed only in financial cost-sharing and premium. These decisions provide a clear test of the predictions of the standard economic model of insurance choice in the absence of choice frictions because plans were priced so that nearly every plan with a lower deductible was financially dominated by an otherwise identical plan with a high deductible. We document that the majority of employees chose dominated plans, which resulted in excess spending equivalent to 24% of chosen plan premiums. Low-income employees were significantly more likely to choose dominated plans, and most employees did not switch into more financially efficient plans in the subsequent year. We show that the choice of dominated plans cannot be rationalized by standard risk preference or any expectations about health risk. Testing alternative explanations with a series of hypothetical-choice experiments, we find that the popularity of dominated plans was not primarily driven by the size and complexity of the plan menu, nor informed preferences for avoiding high deductibles, but by employees’ lack of understanding of health insurance. Our findings challenge the standard practice of inferring risk preferences from insurance choices and raise doubts about the welfare benefits of health reforms that expand consumer choice.",Crossref,85.24590163934427,10.1093/qje/qjx011,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx011,Goal 3,0.07107893958943194,True,health coverage; health workforce
The Questionable Value of Having a Choice of Levels of Health Insurance CoverageJournal of Economic Perspectives,"Ericson, K. & Sydnor, J",2017,,"In most health insurance markets in the United States, consumers have substantial choice about their health insurance plan. However additional choice is not an unmixed blessing as it creates challenges related to both consumer confusion and adverse selection. There is mounting evidence that many people have difficulty understanding the value of insurance coverage, like evaluating the relative benefits of lower premiums versus lower deductibles. Also, in most US health insurance markets, people cannot be charged different prices for insurance based on their individual level of health risk. This creates the potential for well-known problems of adverse selection because people will often base the level of health insurance coverage they choose partly on their health status. In this essay, we examine how the forces of consumer confusion and adverse selection interact with each other and with market institutions to affect how valuable it is to have multiple levels of health insurance coverage available in the market.",Crossref,93.5251798561151,10.1257/jep.31.4.51,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.31.4.51,Goal 3,0.1576079361290993,True,health coverage
The Role of Surge Pricing on a Service Platform with Self-Scheduling CapacityManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Cachon, G. & Daniels, K. & Lobel, R",2017,,"Recent platforms, like Uber and Lyft, offer service to consumers via “self-scheduling” providers who decide for themselves how often to work. These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a “surge pricing” policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform’s profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage (or both), and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity.

Information sharing during auditors’ fraud brainstorming: Effects of psychological safety and auditor knowledgeAuditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory,"Gissel, J. & Zehms, K",2017,,"SUMMARY Conducting a fraud brainstorming session during planning assists with risk-based tailoring of the audit. An effective session should include a team environment in which all members are willing to share information to appropriately calibrate the collective assessment of fraud risk. We report the results of a study (Gissel and Johnstone 2017) in which we manipulate partner leadership in terms of engendering a safe (unsafe) psychological environment whereby subordinates are (are not) encouraged to speak up about fraud-relevant information. Participants are audit staff and seniors, and through the experimental case (based on the Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation fraud) they come to realize that they alone possess fraud-relevant information critical to the team's calibration of fraud risk. These auditors participate in a simulated brainstorming session containing the partner leadership manipulation and indicate changes in their willingness to share the fraud-relevant information with the team. We find that less-knowledgeable auditors become more willing to share their privately known, fraud-relevant information when the partner engenders a safe psychological environment as compared to an unsafe environment. In contrast, more-knowledgeable auditors are impervious to the relative psychological safety engendered by the partner; these individuals are equally willing to speak up regardless of the partner's leadership behavior.

Left understudied are the triggers, actors, and actions preceding industry inception. We integrate recent research in a preliminary framework, conceptualizing the incubation stage as activated by a “trigger” event—a scientific discovery, unmet user need, or mission‐oriented grand challenges—and continuing through the first instances of product commercialization. We focus on illuminating actions of multiple and heterogeneous actors that help reduce high technological and demand uncertainty, thereby shaping industry structure and strategic action post‐commercialization. To point, although the actors may be different, their actions follow a similar theme. We hope this framework spurs future research investigating the understudied incubation stage of new industries. Managerial summary Numerous visionaries––inventors, entrepreneurs, scientists, users, managers, policy makers, and others––spend decades laying the groundwork that leads to the creation of new industries. Their contributions are critical, yet have received little systematic attention. Here, we illuminate their actions during the understudied “incubation” stage sparked by a trigger event and culminating in the first instance of product commercialization. We begin by documenting three triggers: scientific and technological discoveries, unmet user needs, and mission‐oriented grand challenges. We show that following a trigger event, visionaries solve the technological problems required to transform an innovative idea into a viable commercial product and engage potential adopters and stakeholders; they do this by both applying their existing knowledge base and engaging in experimentation.

Incubation of an industry: Heterogeneous knowledge bases and modes of value captureStrategic Management Journal,"Moeen, M. & Agarwal, R",2017,,"Research summary : We examine firms' technological investments during an industry's incubation stage—the period between a technological breakthrough and the first instance of its commercialization. Using the agricultural biotechnology context, we develop stylized findings regarding the understudied knowledge evolution preceding product evolution in an industry's life cycle, the trend and diversity of firms undertaking technological investments in anticipation of industry emergence, their leverage of markets for technology and corporate control, and their use of alternative modes of value capture. We juxtapose these stylized findings with existing literature to identify new theoretical insights, and set the stage for future scholarly work to develop and test new theories for the incubation period, examine its existence in other industries, and study its impact on subsequent firm and industry evolution . M anagerial summary : New technological breakthroughs present managers of existing firms and aspiring entrepreneurs with opportunities to create altogether new industries. During the vibrant incubation period, we find that multiple firms capitalize on diverse knowledge bases to shape the industry's knowledge evolution and also capture economic value in diverse ways. Existing firms in the obsolescing industry are more likely to become targets in acquisitions given their complementary knowledge. Science‐based start‐ups are more likely to engage in acquisitions and collaborations with established firms. Diversifying firms are more likely to commercialize products after leveraging of internal development, acquisitions, and alliances.

Entry into nascent industries: Disentangling a firm’s capability portfolio at the time of investment versus market entryStrategic Management Journal,"Moeen, M",2017,,"Research summary : This article examines the capability antecedents of firm entry into nascent industries. Because a firm's technological investments in nascent industries typically occur before market entry, this study makes a distinction between firm capabilities at the time of market entry and at the time of initial investment. At the time of market entry, core technical capabilities and complementary assets influence the likelihood of entry. However, at the time of investment, a firm's integrative capabilities as well as the initial stocks of related technical capabilities and complementary assets become critical, as they enable endogenous development of core technical capabilities and complementary assets by the time of entry. The empirical sample consists of firms involved in field experiments in agricultural biotechnology during the period 1980–2010 . Managerial summary : New product commercialization in a nascent industry typically requires access to not only core technologies of the focal industry, but also supporting commercialization assets. However, firms may not possess these critical capabilities when they first invest in the industry. Instead, empirical evidence from the context of agricultural biotechnology shows that at the time of first investment, a firm's integrative capabilities partly explain their likelihood of entry. Integrative capabilities encompass a set of practices that enable effective coordination and communication, and in turn put firms in an advantageous position to develop the needed capabilities by the time of entry .

Next, based on extant management literature, we show that two core assumptions underpin the TBL metaphor: win–win and firm‐level sustainability. Then we employ a transdisciplinary comparative analysis to contrast these assumptions with two ecological perspectives: strong sustainability and nested hierarchy.

Politics and Information Technology Investments in the U,"Pang, M",2017,,"Information technologies (IT) act as an enabler for policy implementation in the U.S. federal government.

Drawing on a range of literature from the political science, public administration, and information systems (IS) disciplines, we hypothesize that a federal agency’s capacity-building IT investments are associated with (i) legislative approval for the chief executive, (ii) government dividedness, and (iii) the agency’s ideological characteristic.

Overconfident competing newsvendorsManagement Science,"Li, M. & Petruzzi, N. & Zhang, J",2017,,"Overconfidence is one of the most consistent, powerful, and widespread cognitive biases affecting decision making in situations characterized by random outcomes. In this paper, we study the effects and implications of overconfidence in a competitive newsvendor setting. In this context, overconfidence is defined as a cognitive bias in which decision makers behave as though the outcome of an uncertain event is less risky than it really is. This bias unequivocally leads to a lower expected profit for a newsvendor that does not compete on inventory availability. Nevertheless, it can be a positive force for competing newsvendors. Indeed, we find that when the product’s profit margin is high, overconfidence can lead to a first-best outcome. In a similar vein, we also show that the more biased of two competing newsvendors is not necessarily destined to a smaller expected profit than its less biased competitor.

We consider the case of an exogenous retail price as well as the case of an endogenous retail price, and we find in both cases that the manufacturer's and the retailer's expected profits in equilibrium are not necessarily monotone decreasing in the uncertainty level.

To Cyberloaf or Not to Cyberloaf: The Impact of the Announcement of Formal Organizational ControlsJournal of Management Information Systems,"Khansa, L. & Kuem, J. & Siponen, M. & Kim, S",2017,,"We investigate the changing causal relationships between cyberloafing behavior and its antecedents after the announcement of formal organizational controls that, unlike informal controls, are officially imposed by organizations. Drawing on Akers’s social learning theory, we first propose neutralization, perceived risk, past cyberloafing, and peer cyberloafing as antecedents of cyberloafing. We then develop a theoretical account of how their impacts change from before to after the announcement of formal controls. The proposed model was empirically tested using data collected from two separate surveys administered a month apart. The first survey captured the preannouncement state of cyberloafing among respondents; the follow-up survey was administered after the respondents were asked to assume that their company had just announced anti-cyberloafing controls that used explicit monitoring and sanctions. We show that preannouncement, employees’ intentions to cyberloaf are mostly influenced by their past tendencies to cyberloaf and by others’ cyberloafing, but their neutralization and perceived risk play no significant role. In contrast, postannouncement, the impacts of individuals’ neutralization and perceived risk on their cyberloafing suddenly become significant. Theoretically, we demonstrate that to accurately predict noncompliant behavior, it is important to account for all four antecedents and incorporate the announcement of formal controls. Practically, understanding how this announcement affects the relationships between cyberloafing and its antecedents suggests different areas managers need to target, pre- and postannouncement, to curb cyberloafing.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),78.0701754385965,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07421222.2017.1297173,Goal 1,0.006459032966926916,False,

Race matters for women leaders: Intersectional effects on agentic deficiencies and penaltiesThe Leadership Quarterly,"Rosette, A. & Koval, C. & Ma, A. & Livingston, R",2016,,"A significant amount of the research on two types of biases against women leaders—agentic deficiency (perceptions that women have minimal leadership potential) and agentic penalty (backlash for counter-stereotypical behavior)—has generally presumed that the descriptive, prescriptive, and proscriptive stereotypes on which the biases are based are comparable for women across racial groups. We propose that the degree to which agentic deficiencies and penalties occur is contingent on the dimension of agency that is under consideration and its relation to the stereotypes associated with the target's gendered and racial group. The results of our literature review and analysis suggest that when considered in the context of gender and leadership research, at least two dimensions of agency, competence and dominance, closely align with perceptions of agentic deficiency and agentic penalty, respectively. Based on our analysis and the prevalent stereotypes of Black and Asian American women that are likely most relevant to the two types of biases against women leaders, we examined the interactive effects of racial stereotypes and the agentic biases.

Non-Big 4 Local Market Leadership and its Effect on CompetitionThe Accounting Review,"Keune, M. & Mayhew, B. & Schmidt, J",2016,,ABSTRACT This study examines local characteristics associated with non-Big 4 local market leadership and the impact of non-Big 4 local market leadership on competition. We identify non-Big 4 local market leaders by collecting accounting firm rankings from business publications for 46 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas from 2005–2010. These rankings are based on the number of local office employees and provide a more holistic measure of office size than measures based on public company audit fees. We find local supply and demand factors are significantly associated with non-Big 4 local market leadership and that non-Big 4 leadership is associated with lower overall audit fees in the local market. We also find that non-Big 4 leaders earn a fee premium over other non-Big 4 auditors. Our results imply that non-Big 4 leaders increase local market competition.

Our results also support a contingency approach to pay-for-performance’s impact on future employee performance, as we find that merit pay and bonus pay can substitute for each other and that the strength of pay-for-performance’s effect is a function of employee tenure, the pay-for-performance trend over time, and job type (presumably due to differences in the measurability of employee performance across jobs).",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),78.32167832167832,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206313515520,Goal 8,0.03422477165484377,False,

We use analysts’ forecasts of pretax and after‐tax income to impute premanaged earnings, or earnings before any tax manipulation. Pre‐ FIN 48, we observe that firms reduce their tax reserves (i.e., increase income) when premanaged earnings are below analysts’ forecasts. Specifically, 78 percent of firm‐quarters that would have missed the analyst forecast if not for the tax reserve decrease, meet that target when the decrease is included. Furthermore, we find a significant positive association between the decrease in tax reserves and the deviation of premanaged earnings from analysts’ forecasts. In contrast, post‐ FIN 48, we find no evidence that firms use changes in tax reserves to manage earnings to meet analysts’ forecasts.

Thus, we briefly outline these ideas, and we develop fundamental, high-level research questions related to audit JDM research that are based on these ideas. Finally, we provide guidance for designing and evaluating experiments that effectively use these frameworks, whether in auditing or other rich decision-making contexts.

The Sum and it’s Parts: Judgmental Hierarchical ForecastingManagement Science,"Kremer, M. & Siemsen, E. & Thomas, D",2016,,"Firms require demand forecasts at different levels of aggregation to support a variety of resource allocation decisions. For example, a retailer needs store-level forecasts to manage inventory at the store, but also requires a regionally aggregated forecast for managing inventory at a distribution center. In generating an aggregate forecast, a firm can choose to make the forecast directly based on the aggregated data or indirectly by summing lower-level forecasts (i.e., bottom up). Our study investigates the relative performance of such hierarchical forecasting processes through a behavioral lens. We identify two judgment biases that affect the relative performance of direct and indirect forecasting approaches: a propensity for random judgment errors and a failure to benefit from the informational value that is embedded in the correlation structure between lower-level demands. Based on these biases, we characterize demand environments where one hierarchical process results in more accurate forecasts than the other.

Although past research has explored the relationship between psychological distance, construal and consumer evaluation, the effects of various dimensions of distance have only been considered in isolation. Our research contributes to past work by testing the effects of experiencing two dimensions of psychological distance simultaneously on construal and consumer evaluations.

Stemming from a lay belief that revisions signal the emergence of a trend, we find in 10 studies (comprising uncertain events such as weather, climate change, sex, sports, and wine) that upward changes to event-probability (eg, increasing from 20% to 30%) cause events to feel less remote than downward changes (eg, decreasing from 40% to 30%), and subsequently change people’s behavior regarding those events despite the revised event-probabilities being the same.

Supporting Strategic Success through Enterprise-Wide Reputation Risk ManagementJournal of Risk Finance,"Gatzert, N. & Schmit, J",2016,,"– The purpose of this paper is to present a coherent and effective enterprise risk management (ERM) framework that includes necessary steps and processes for integrating reputation risk management into an organization’s overall ERM approach which is intended to support corporate strategic success. In particular, reputation creation, enhancement, and protection are critical to an organization’s success, yet highly challenging given the wide ranging and somewhat opaque nature of the concept. These qualities call for a strong ERM approach to reputation that is holistic and integrative, yet existing knowledge of how to do so is limited.
– The paper evaluates and synthesizes existing reputation literature in developing an enterprise-wide reputation risk management framework incorporating necessary steps, processes, and considerations. We address risk strategy, risk assessment, risk governance, and risk culture as key elements of ERM and conclude with suggestions for future research.
– The results suggest several important ideas which are of great relevance when integrating reputation risk management into an ERM framework. Among these are the importance of: identifying and understanding the purpose of key stakeholders, appreciating the multidimensional and layered effect of events on organizational reputation and monitoring the influence of technological advances.
– The authors contribute to the literature by developing a framework for enterprise-wide reputation risk management that applies across industries. In contrast to previous work, the authors offer a broader perspective on the underlying causes and consequences of reputation damage based on empirical evidence and insight from the academic literature and provide additional detail in identification of reputation determinants, antecedents, and drivers.

Insurers have responded to this development only recently by offering new reputation risk insurance solutions. The aim of this article is to present the first detailed academic analysis of these new insurance policies, including examination of the risks insurers face in offering such coverage. We also offer a conceptualization of reputation risk in an insurance and risk management context with focus on exposures, perils, and hazards. Our analysis indicates that loss identification and measurement generate the greatest challenges to insurers in providing reputation risk coverage. Lack of experience as well as the complexity of the chain of reputation risk events related to reputation insurance coverage present insurers with significant challenges in making this a viable line of business.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/jori.12065,https://doi.org/10.1111/jori.12065,Goal 1,0.01789480183200621,False,
Accounting Rules and Post-Acquisition Profitability in Business CombinationsAccounting Horizons,"Dickinson, V. & Wangerin, D. & Wild, J",2016,,"SYNOPSIS: Prior studies report a decline or no change in acquirers' profitability after a merger or business acquisition. Those studies, however, do not consider the downward impact on profitability that stems from use of the “purchase accounting” (and in later periods, “acquisition”) method for business combinations. Drawing on financial statement data from both targets and acquirers, we estimate the effects of the application of purchase/acquisition method accounting rules on post-acquisition profitability. We find that recognition rules for acquired inventories, deferred revenues, in-process research and development (IPR&D), and depreciation and amortization expense resulting from writing acquired assets up to fair value vis-á-vis purchase/acquisition accounting methods are all important sources of downward pressure in post-acquisition profitability. We find that investors and analysts appear to recognize the effects of IPR&D in assessing post-acquisition profitability of the combined entity. The findings also suggest that investors and analysts do not appear to fully incorporate the accounting effects related to inventories, deferred revenues, and depreciation and amortization expense for post-acquisition profitability.

Building supply chain resilience through virtual stockpile poolingProduction and Operations Management,"Liu, F. & Song, J. & Tong, J",2016,,"Stockpiling inventory is an essential strategy for building supply chain resilience. It enables firms to continue operating while finding a solution to an unexpected event that causes a supply disruption or demand surge. While extremely valuable when actually deployed, stockpiles incur large holding costs and usually provide no benefits until such a time. To help to reduce this cost, this study presents a new approach for managing stockpiles. We show that if leveraged intelligently, stockpiles can also help an organization better meet its own regular demand by enabling a type of virtual pooling we call virtual stockpile pooling (VSP). The idea of VSP is to first integrate the stockpile into several locations’ regular inventory buffers and then dynamically reallocate the stockpile among these locations in reaction to the demand realizations to achieve a kind of virtual transshipment. To study how to execute VSP and determine when it can provide the most value, we formulate a stylized multi‐location stochastic inventory model and solve for the optimal stockpile allocation and inventory order policies. We show that VSP can provide significant cost savings: in some cases nearly the full holding cost of the stockpile (i.e., VSP effectively maintains the stockpile for free), in other cases nearly the savings of traditional physical inventory pooling. Last, our results prescribe implementing VSP with many locations for large stockpiles, but only a few locations for small stockpiles.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),93.54838709677419,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12573,Goal 9,0.01054292137074255,False,supply chain disruptions
Supply chain planning for random demand surges: Reactive capacity and safety stockManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Huang, L. & Song, J. & Tong, J",2016,,"Globalization, innovation, social media, and exposure to natural and man-made disasters have increased organizations’ need to cope with demand surges: random, significant increases in demand in an otherwise relatively stable demand environment. To build supply chain capabilities, organizations face a choice between two fundamentally different sourcing strategies—reactive capacity and safety stock. We develop a framework to guide the joint sourcing strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost under a target service level. A salient feature of our modeling framework is a novel demand model that captures important continuous-time, non-Markovian characteristics of demand surge trajectories. In addition to the total magnitude as typically modeled in the literature, we define several other metrics of surges, including duration, intensity, compactness, peak position, volatility, and frequency. The resulting optimization problem is challenging because it requires evaluating, for any sample path, whether surge demand can be satisfied at every point in time—a refined feature that traditional models do not have. To identify the optimal strategy, we first characterize the optimal production and deployment policy for any given strategy and then transform the original problem into two equivalent but more tractable problems. Finally, through stochastic comparison techniques, we show how the magnitude and predictability of surge demand characteristics (mentioned above) and the cost profiles of each strategy impact the optimal joint strategy.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),96.20253164556962,,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2016.0583,Goal 1,0.0163865195329575,False,disasters

A Field Survey of Contemporary Brainstorming PracticesAccounting Horizons,"Dennis, S. & Zehms, K",2016,,"SYNOPSIS: The purpose of this study is to guide practice and future research by examining contemporary fraud brainstorming practices. Using field data collected from audits conducted during 2013–2014, we investigate team characteristics, attendance and communication, brainstorming structure, timing, and effort, and brainstorming quality. Results show that although some practices are similar to those reported in earlier field studies, there are interesting differences (e.g., decreased use of checklists, shorter sessions, and risk-based deployment of resources in brainstorming). These differences suggest brainstorming has evolved throughout the intervening period during which new audit standards became effective and the PCAOB criticized auditors' performance in fraud risk identification and risk response generation. We also examine differences in audit team characteristics and brainstorming practices across risk and trading-status partitions. Results reveal auditors deploy more resources to brainstorming when engagement risk is heightened (i.e., publicly traded clients with high fraud and/or high inherent risk); correspondingly, brainstorming quality is higher on these engagements.

Assurors conduct these engagements using multidisciplinary teams containing varying technical expertise, with some possessing financial audit-related expertise (“traditional auditors”) and others possessing science- or combined science/financial-related expertise. In an experiment in which traditional auditor participants respond to a simulated multidisciplinary team, we find that participants inappropriately rely on an explanation for an unexpected analytical procedures fluctuation from a senior-level assuror with GHG science-related expertise, irrespective of whether the situation requires that expertise. We also examine whether the review process might provide a solution to this inappropriate reliance, and report nuanced results. That is, we find that while inappropriate reliance on the senior-level assuror with science-related expertise is reduced by having a manager-level reviewer with financial audit-related expertise, inappropriate reliance is even greater when the manager-level reviewer possesses GHG science-related or combined science/financial expertise.",Crossref,96.0,10.2308/ajpt-51368,https://doi.org/10.2308/ajpt-51368,Goal 17,0.01457075981607875,False,

A two-sided matching approach for partner selection and assessing complementarities in partners’ attributes in inter-firm alliancesStrategic Management Journal,"Mindruta, D. & Moeen, M. & Agarwal, R",2016,,"Research summary : Strategic alliances are undertaken to create value through complementarities of resources and capabilities of the partner firms. This paper uses a recently developed estimator of matching games, i.e., the maximum score estimator, to advance strategic management research on partner selection in strategic alliances, with a focus on the formation of research alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry. We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we develop a matching framework to study strategic alliances, taking a market perspective that explicitly incorporates key features of alliance formation: two‐sided decision making; quest for complementarities between indivisible and heterogeneous partner attributes; and competition on each side of the market for partners on the other side of the market. Second, we assess the relative performance of the maximum score and standard discrete choice estimators by performing simulations based on known functional relationships in various matching scenarios. Third, within the context of biopharmaceutical research alliances, we hypothesize and find support using the maximum score estimator for complementarity in partner size and in upstream research capabilities . Managerial summary: A critical question facing managers who seek to benefit from strategic alliances is “whom to ally with”. Typically, each party seeks a partner whose attributes reinforce their own. This paper explains that the interaction of these preferences leads to a market-wide sorting of alliance partners. Since the value created by an alliance is driven by attributes of all alliance partners, firms cannot successfully bid financial resources to get access to their most preferred partner. Instead, managers need to understand the market-wide competition and invest in the “right” mixture of attributes to make their firm more attractive in the market for alliance partners. Using this framework, we highlight firms' sizes and research capabilities as two drivers of partner selection and sorting in bio-pharmaceutical research alliances .

Innovative Assessment of Inpatient and Pulmonary Drug Costs for Children with Cystic FibrosisPediatric Pulmonology,"Levy, J. & Rosenberg, M. & Farrell, P",2016,,"Previous estimates of the cost of care for pediatric Cystic fibrosis (CF) showed wide variation, without specific summary of pulmonary drug costs.
Enrolled CF children from the Wisconsin newborn screening trial were evaluated quarterly per protocol. Assessments systematically included all treatments, hospitalizations, and nutritional and pulmonary outcomes. Direct medical costs from hospital billing and medical records from 1989 to 2010 were used to describe costs by age‐ranges and subgroups throughout follow‐up. Outpatient drugs were separated by category (pulmonary/otherwise). Inpatient and drug costs were examined by clinical risk factors (presence of meconium ileus, pancreatic insufficiency, and expected severity of genetic mutations).
Seventy‐three children were followed for an average of 12.9 years with an average annual total cost of care of $24,768. Outpatient drug costs (53%) and hospitalizations (32%) represented the majority of costs. Drug costs were 48% for pulmonary indications and 52% for non‐pulmonary. Pulmonary drug costs for children taking dornase were 54% of their drug costs while pulmonary drug costs were only 31% for children not taking dornase. Significant differences in frequency of inpatient stays existed for children with pancreatic insufficiency. Substantial differences in treatment costs exist as children age and by clinical risk factor.
This study provides more accurate longitudinal estimates of CF care costs throughout childhood and shows that increasing age, pancreatic insufficiency, use of dornase, and hospitalizations are key determinants of cost. These estimates can be included in evaluations of the cost‐effectiveness of new, highly expensive treatments being introduced for any CF population.

Do CIO IT Budgets Explain Bigger or Smaller Governments? – Theory and Evidence from U,"Pang, M. & Tafti, A. & Krishnan, M",2016,,"Given the recent concern on “big governments” and rising budget deficits in the United States and European nations, there has been a fundamental economic debate on the proper boundary and role of governments in a society. Inspired by this debate, we study the relationship between information technology (IT) and government size. Drawing on a broad range of the literature from multiple disciplines such as information systems, industrial organization, and political sciences, we present several theoretical mechanisms that explain the impact of IT on government expenditures. Using a variety of data on IT spending and state government expenditures, we find that greater IT investments made by a state chief information officer (CIO) are associated with lower state government spending. It is estimated that on average, a $1 increase in state CIO budgets is associated with a reduction of as much as $3.49 in state overall expenditures.

Effects of remanufacturable product design on market segmentation and the environmentDecision Sciences,"Shi, T. & Gu, W. & Chhajed, D. & Petruzzi, N",2016,,"ABSTRACT Despite documented benefits of remanufacturing, many manufacturers have yet to embrace the idea of tapping into remanufactured‐goods markets. In this article, we explore this dichotomy and analyze the effect of remanufacturable product design on market segmentation and product and trade‐in prices by studying a two‐stage profit‐maximization problem in which a price‐setting manufacturer can choose whether or not to open a remanufactured‐goods market for its product. Our results suggest that it is optimal for a manufacturer to design a remanufacturable product when the value‐added from remanufacturing is relatively high but product durability is relatively low and innovation is nominal. In addition, we find that entering a remanufactured‐goods market in and of itself does not necessarily translate into environmental friendliness. On the one hand, the optimal trade‐in program could result in low return and/or remanufacturing rates. On the other hand, a low price for remanufactured products could attract higher demand and thereby potentially result in more damage to the environment. Meanwhile, external restrictions imposed on total greenhouse gas emissions draw criticism in their own right because they risk stifling growth or reducing overall consumer welfare. Given these trade‐offs, we therefore develop and compare several measures of environmental efficiency and conclude that emissions per revenue can serve as the best proxy for emissions as a metric for measuring overall environmental stewardship.",Crossref,84.49197860962568,10.1111/deci.12191,https://doi.org/10.1111/deci.12191,Goal 12,0.05185632946018749,True,environmental taxes; environmentally friendly consumption; greenhouse gas emissions; reusable products; sustainable product design

Multilevel modeling of insurance claims using copulasAnnals of Applied Statistics,"Shi, P. & Feng, X. & Boucher, J",2016,,"In property-casualty insurance, claims management is featured with the modeling of a semi-continuous insurance cost associated with individual risk transfer. This practice is further complicated by the multilevel structure of the insurance claims data, where a contract often contains a group of policyholders, each policyholder is insured under multiple types of coverage, and the contract is repeatedly observed over time. The data hierarchy introduces a complex dependence structure among claims and leads to diversification in the insurer’s liability portfolio.
To capture the unique features of policy-level insurance costs, we propose a copula regression for the multivariate longitudinal claims. In the model, the Tweedie double generalized linear model is employed to examine the semi-continuous claim cost of each coverage type, and a Gaussian copula is specified to accommodate the cross-sectional and temporal dependence among the multilevel claims. Estimation and inference is based on the composite likelihood approach and the properties of parameter estimates are investigated through simulation studies.

A Bayesian quantile regression model for insurance company costs dataJournal of the Royal Statistical Society – A,"Sriram, K. & Shi, P. & Ghosh, P",2016,,"We examine the average cost function for property and casualty insurers. The cost function describes the relationship between a firm's minimum production cost and outputs. A comparison of cost functions could shed light on the relative cost efficiency of individual firms, which is of interest to many market participants and has been given extensive attention in the insurance industry. To identify and to compare the cost function, current practice is to assume a common functional form between costs and outputs across insurers and then to rank insurers according to the centre of the cost distribution. However, the assumption of a common cost–output relationship could be misleading because insurers tend to adopt different technologies that are reflected by the cost function in their production process. The centre-based comparison could also lead to biased inference especially when the cost distribution is skewed with a heavy tail. To address these issues, we model the average production cost of insurers by using a Bayesian quantile regression approach. Quantile regression enables the modelling of different quantiles of the cost distribution as opposed to just the centre. The Bayesian approach helps to estimate the cost-to-output functional relationship at a firm level by borrowing information across firms. In the analysis of US property–casualty insurers, we show that better insights into efficiency are gained by comparing different quantiles of the cost distribution.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),96.2406015037594,,https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/article-abstract/179/1/177/7058553,Goal 12,0.01305729186050412,False,

A Revised Model for Presentation in the Statement(s) of Financial Performance: Implications for the Measurement Chapter of the Conceptual FrameworkAccounting Horizons,"Linsmeier, T",2016,,"SYNOPSIS: Current financial performance reporting has led to a focus on earnings per share and a proliferation of both non-GAAP measures and items reported in other comprehensive income. I examine characteristics of some of the more common non-GAAP earnings adjustments to propose a financial performance reporting model that consistently presents information with those characteristics separately. This reporting model focuses on distinguishing operating results from nonoperating results and within those categories presenting recurring amounts separately from nonrecurring amounts. I next explore potential implications for measurement. This analysis identifies conditions when the recognition of incremental unrealized gains or losses (UGLs) in income under a fair value measurement model improves relevance of reported information. The analysis suggests that UGLs provide most relevant information when there are no internal or external constraints affecting management's ability to sell an asset or transfer a liability before maturity or the end of its useful life. When assets/liabilities are constrained from being sold/transferred before maturity or the end of their useful lives, reported UGLs will reverse to zero over time, limiting relevance. This analysis supports measurement of financial assets and investment properties at fair value and provides a potential basis for measuring other assets and liabilities at historical cost.",Crossref,91.80327868852459,10.2308/acch-51543,https://doi.org/10.2308/acch-51543,Goal 10,0.01701803994164517,False,

To unearth the temporal dynamics underlying the success and failure of ICT implementations in organizations in developing countries, we conducted a two-year multimethod study of an ICT implementation at a large bank in India.

"A Marathon, a Series of Sprints, or Both? Tournament Horizon and Dynamic Task Complexity in Multi-Period SettingsThe Accounting Review","Choi, J. & Newman, A. & Tafkov, I",2016,,"ABSTRACT When using a tournament in multi-period settings, firms have discretion in selecting the tournament horizon. For example, firms can use a single tournament (a grand tournament) or a sequence of multiple tournaments, each with a shorter horizon than a grand tournament (a repeated tournament). Firms have also begun to use a combination of both in which a repeated tournament is embedded within a grand tournament (a hybrid tournament). Using an experiment, we investigate whether the effect of tournament horizon on performance depends on the dynamic complexity of the task, which reflects the potential for effort in one period to influence the link between effort and performance in future periods. When dynamic task complexity is low, we find that performance is greatest in the hybrid tournament, followed by the repeated and then the grand tournament. In contrast, when dynamic task complexity is high, we find that performance is greatest in the repeated tournament, followed by the grand and hybrid tournaments, with similar performance in the latter two tournaments. More generally, the results of our experiment suggest that the effect of tournament horizon on performance depends on dynamic task complexity. These results can help firms make better decisions when designing their tournaments by reinforcing the need to align the tournament horizon with the task.",Crossref,95.85253456221199,10.2308/accr-51358,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51358,Goal 6,0.001251763986141439,False,
Vicarious Learning under Implicit ContractsThe Accounting Review,"Choi, J. & Hecht, G. & Tafkov, I. & Towry, K",2016,,"ABSTRACT Employee contracts often allow for managerial discretion, such that the manager decides after observing an employee's performance how that employee will be rewarded or penalized. Importantly, the effects of such evaluation outcomes can extend beyond the employee(s) directly affected, because such outcomes can be observed by other employees within the firm. The net effect of such vicarious learning as an indirect control depends on the inferences employees make after observing a peer's evaluation outcome. In this study, we use an experiment to investigate whether the inferences observer-employees make about how managers evaluate and reward employee behavior depend on whether the valence of the observed outcome is positive or negative. Using the setting of a strategic performance measurement system, we test and find support for a causal model, in which the valence of the observed outcome influences observer-employees' inferences and subsequent behavioral focus via their psychological distance from, and their construal of, the observed outcome. Our results suggest that how observer-employees respond after observing a peer employee's evaluation outcome is asymmetric. Specifically, when contemplating their own behavior, employees who observe positive outcomes focus on the performance measures within the strategic performance measurement system, whereas those who observe negative outcomes focus on the underlying strategic construct.",Crossref,86.84210526315789,10.2308/accr-51293,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51293,Goal 4,0.006027127293730098,False,
Commercial Real Estate Rental Index: A Dynamic Panel Data Model EstimationReal Estate Economics,"An, X. & Deng, Y. & Fisher, J. & Hu, M",2016,,"Using the actual quarterly rental income generated in the years between 2001 and 2010 by over 9,000 NCREIF commercial properties, we construct a commercial real estate rental index and estimate the time series properties ( e.g ., mean‐reversion speed and volatility) of market‐wide rental growth using a dynamic panel data model. The dynamic panel data model has several advantages over a standard hedonic regression. In addition, we incorporate age effects into our panel data model, and by doing so we correct the age bias in the repeated sales method and in the simple average method. Our estimates show that rental growth is cyclical but it generally lags behind broader economic growth. Surprisingly, the long‐term average rental growth is significantly lower than what is usually perceived, and the volatility of rental growth can be significantly under estimated when the conventional methods are adopted. We also find significant cross‐property type and cross‐region variations in the rental adjustment process. In contrast to the existing literature, we find a strong negative relation between rental growth and cap rate, and that this relation is significantly stronger than that between NOI growth and cap rate.

Introducing an MLS reduces the number of agents, increases agents’ effort levels and improves total surplus. Current commission rates of 5–7% appear much higher than the competitive commission rate, leading to too many agents, too much effort by agents and a lower overall surplus.

Supplier Encroachment as an Enhancement or a Hindrance to Nonlinear PricingProduction and Operations Management,"Li, Z. & Gilbert, S. & Lai, G",2015,,"The objective of this study was to extend existing understanding of supplier encroachment to contexts in which there is information asymmetry and the supplier can use nonlinear pricing. Prior research has shown that supplier encroachment can mitigate double marginalization and thus benefit both the supplier and the reseller. However, under symmetric information, this benefit disappears if the supplier can use nonlinear pricing. In our model, the reseller observes the true market size while the supplier knows only the prior distribution, that is, a seemingly ideal setting for implementing mechanism design through nonlinear pricing. We first show that, because encroachment capability enables the supplier to make an ex post output decision, it fundamentally alters the structure of the optimal nonlinear pricing policy. In addition to the usual downward distortion effect, where the reseller may purchase less than the efficient quantity, we also have the possibility for upward distortion. Thus, under asymmetric information and nonlinear pricing, supplier encroachment has two opposing effects. On one hand, the ability to shift sales to the direct channel allows the supplier to reduce information rents with less sacrifice of efficiency; but on the other hand, by introducing the possibility of her own opportunistic behavior, it can result in upward distortion of the quantities sold through the reselling channel, which is a new source of inefficiency. Depending upon the relative efficiency of the reselling channel and the demand distribution, either of these two effects may dominate and the supplier's ability to encroach may either benefit or hurt both the supplier and the reseller.",Crossref,94.36619718309859,10.1111/poms.12210,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12210,Goal 9,0.007584918790387656,False,

Audits of Complex Estimates as Verification of Management Numbers: How Institutional Pressure Shape PracticeContemporary Accounting Research,"Griffith, E. & Hammersley, J. & Kadous, K",2015,,"Abstract Auditors and regulators have invested heavily in improving audits of estimates in recent years, but problems in this area persist. We examine the causes of these problems and why they persist. To do so, we interview 24 very experienced auditors about how they audit complex accounting estimates such as fair values and impairments and what problems they experience in the process. We find that auditors overwhelmingly choose to audit the details of management's estimate rather than use other allowable approaches. The steps auditors describe and the language they use to describe those steps indicate that they follow a process of verifying individual elements of management's assertions on a piecemeal basis, resulting in overreliance on management's process, rather than engaging in a critical analysis of the overall estimate. The problems that auditors identify are consistent with this view, and include failures to notice inconsistencies among the estimate and other internal data or external conditions and overreliance on specialists to identify, evaluate, and challenge critical assumptions. We interpret these processes and problems using institutional theory and identify two root causes: standards' and firm policies' emphasis on verifying management's model, and audit firms' division of knowledge between auditors and specialists. Institutional theory proposes these conventions arise from firms extending use of procedures that are legitimate in one area (i.e., auditing accounts without significant uncertainty) to a new area (i.e., auditing complex estimates), even though they are likely less effective in the new area. These conventions are reinforced by regulators' method of inspection and by firms' reluctance to change methods without a prompt to change to a clearly better method. We argue that these institutionalized conventions thwart auditors' good‐faith attempts to engage in skeptical analysis of estimates. Thus, audit quality problems are likely to persist.",Crossref,90.15544041450778,10.1111/1911-3846.12104,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12104,Goal 15,0.01005674708419078,False,

How gender composition evokes interpersonally sensitive behavior on collaborative cross-boundary projectsOrganization Science,"Williams, M. & Polman, E",2015,,"This paper investigates how professional workers’ willingness to act with interpersonal sensitivity is influenced by the gender and power of their interaction partners.

Rather, we argue that the social category “women” can evoke more sensitive behavior from others such that men as well as women contribute to an increase in sensitivity in mixed-gender interactions. We further argue that the presence of women may trigger increased sensitivity such that men can also be the recipients of more sensitivity when one or more women are present on a team. In a study of 202 management consultants, we found that the willingness to act with interpersonal sensitivity increased in interactions with women. Moreover, this effect was greater in interactions with women who had low reward power—i.e., females who better fit the expectations associated with the social category “women.” We also found team-level effects.

The Influence of Ownership and Compensation Practices on Charitable ActivitiesContemporary Accounting Research,"Eldenburg, L. & Gaertner, F. & Goodman, T",2015,,"Abstract Recent accounting research provides evidence that similar profit‐based compensation incentives are used in for‐profit and nonprofit hospitals. Because charity care reduces profits, such incentives should lead for‐profit hospital managers to reduce charity care levels. Nonprofit hospital managers, however, may respond differently to the same incentives because they face a different set of institutional pressures and constraints. We compare the association between pay‐for‐performance incentives and charity care in for‐profit and nonprofit hospitals. We find a negative and significant association between charity care and our proxy for profit‐based incentives in for‐profit hospitals, and no significant association in nonprofit hospitals. These results suggest that linking manager pay to profitability does not appear to discourage charity care in nonprofit hospitals. Apparently, the nonprofit mission, institutional pressures, and ownership constraints moderate the potentially negative effects of profit‐based incentives. Because this evidence partially alleviates concerns over nonprofit compensation arrangements that mirror those used in for‐profit hospitals, it should be of interest to regulators and policymakers.

Advance Demand Information in a Multiproduct SystemManufacturing & Service Operations Management,"Bernstein, F. & DeCroix, G",2015,,"In this paper we examine the impact of different types of advance demand information on firm profit and on the benefits of resource flexibility. Specifically, we consider a firm that must choose capacities of resources that will be used to satisfy stochastic demand for multiple products, where demands follow a multivariate normal distribution. Prior to the capacity decision, the firm receives information revealing either the total volume of demand across products or the mix of demand between products. We examine two different scenarios: a dedicated resource setting with product-specific resources and a common resource scenario with one flexible resource. For both scenarios we derive the distribution of the (possibly imperfect) volume or mix demand signal, as well as the conditional distributions of demand given the particular signal. We explore the impact of either type of information on optimal capacities and profit. We find that commonality and volume information are strategic complements—so that it is more valuable to obtain volume information in settings with a common resource. On the other hand, commonality and mix information are strategic substitutes. Moreover, we find that mix and volume information themselves are complements in systems with dedicated resources. Having either type of information is valuable in reducing uncertainty for each individual product demand, but having both of them together provides information on two different dimensions, allowing for a much greater reduction in demand uncertainty. In systems with a common resource, however, the two types of information are substitutes. Because volume information is well aligned with commonality (both focus on total demand), such information already provides much of the value that can be obtained—having mix information adds limited additional value.",Crossref,92.63157894736842,10.1287/msom.2014.0502,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2014.0502,Goal 12,0.03465482763483978,False,
Good and Bad Uncertainty: Macroeconomic and Financial Market ImplicationsJournal of Financial Economics,"Segal, G. & Shaliastovich, I. & Yaron, A",2015,,"Does macroeconomic uncertainty increase or decrease aggregate growth and asset prices? To address this question, we decompose aggregate uncertainty into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ volatility components, associated with positive and negative innovations to macroeconomic growth. We document that in line with our theoretical framework, these two uncertainties have opposite impact on aggregate growth and asset prices. Good uncertainty predicts an increase in future economic activity, such as consumption, output, and investment, and is positively related to valuation ratios, while bad uncertainty forecasts a decline in economic growth and depresses asset prices. Further, the market price of risk and equity beta of good uncertainty are positive, while negative for bad uncertainty. Hence, both uncertainty risks contribute positively to risk premia, and help explain the cross-section of expected returns beyond cash flow risk.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),81.0126582278481,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X15000756,Goal 8,0.03881281570470246,False,

Monetary Policy Risks in the Bond Markets and Macroeconomy,"Shaliastovich, I. & Yamarthy, R",2015,,"What is the role of monetary policy fluctuations for macroeconomic uncertainty and nominal bond risks? To answer this question we develop a structurally motivated asset-pricing framework which incorporates the flexible dynamics of a timevarying Taylor rule and macroeconomic factors, and risk pricing restrictions that arise from recursive preferences. In our model, movements in monetary regimes can affect short rate sensitivities to expected growth and expected inflation, and the conditional volatility of inflation expectations. We use a Bayesian MCMC particle filter approach to estimate the model using the macroeconomic, forecast, and term structure data. We find that aggressive policy regimes are associated with high volatility of inflation and high levels and volatilities of bond yields and bond risk premia. Movements in monetary policy significantly contribute to persistent fluctuations in bond risk premia. In aggressive regime, short rate sensitivity to inflation and the conditional uncertainty about future inflation both increase, which tends to raise bond risk premia. On the other hand, an increase in short rate sensitivity to expected real growth has an opposite, dampening effect.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),91.37931034482759,,https://www.stern.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/1%20-%20Monetary%20Policy%20Risks%20in%20the%20Bond%20Markets%20and%20Macroeconomy_Shaliastovich_Yamarthy_0.pdf,Goal 8,0.01056288710988531,False,

The CIT construct is defined as the degree to which an individual is comfortable with intentional interpersonal touch from or to another person.

Investigation of this construct includes scale development, measure purification, and validation. We situate CIT‐initiating and CIT‐receiving within an approach–avoidance framework and demonstrate that comfort with initiating touch is more related to approach tendencies such as assertiveness while comfort with receiving touch is more related to avoidant tendencies such as avoiding crowded spaces. While previous research generally finds positive effects of interpersonal touch, we find that these effects, at least in part, depend on an individual's comfort with interpersonal touch.

US-Based Drug Cost Parameter Estimation for Economic EvaluationsMedical Decision Making,"Levy, J. & Meek, P. & Rosenberg, M",2015,,"Introduction. In the United States, more than 10% of national health expenditures are for prescription drugs. Assessing drug costs in US economic evaluation studies is not consistent, as the true acquisition cost of a drug is not known by decision modelers. Current US practice focuses on identifying one reasonable drug cost and imposing some distributional assumption to assess uncertainty. Methods. We propose a set of Rules based on current pharmacy practice that account for the heterogeneity of drug product costs. The set of products derived from our Rules, and their associated costs, form an empirical distribution that can be used for more realistic sensitivity analyses and create transparency in drug cost parameter computation. The Rules specify an algorithmic process to select clinically equivalent drug products that reduce pill burden, use an appropriate package size, and assume uniform weighting of substitutable products. Three diverse examples show derived empirical distributions and are compared with previously reported cost estimates. Results. The shapes of the empirical distributions among the 3 drugs differ dramatically, including multiple modes and different variation. Previously published estimates differed from the means of the empirical distributions. Published ranges for sensitivity analyses did not cover the ranges of the empirical distributions. In one example using lisinopril, the empirical mean cost of substitutable products was $444 (range = $23–$953) as compared with a published estimate of $305 (range = $51–$523). Conclusions. Our Rules create a simple and transparent approach to creating cost estimates of drug products and assessing their variability. The approach is easily modified to include a subset of, or different weighting for, substitutable products. The derived empirical distribution is easily incorporated into 1-way or probabilistic sensitivity analyses.",Crossref,89.65517241379311,10.1177/0272989x14563987,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x14563987,Goal 3,0.02512071507632704,False,health care costs

Specifically, a firm has the option to design a non-remanufacturable or a remanufacturable product and to specify a corresponding quality, and the design choices affect both the production costs and consumer valuations associated with the product. On the cost side, remanufacturable products cost more to produce originally, but less to remanufacture, than non-remanufacturable products cost to produce. Analogously, on the consumer side, remanufacturable products are valued more, but remanufactured products are valued less, than non-remanufacturable products are valued. Given this, we investigate the environmental consequences of designing for remanufacturability by first defining a measure of environmental impact that ultimately is a function of what is produced and how much is produced, and then applying that measure to assess the environmental impact associated with the firm׳s optimal strategy relative to the environmental impact associated with the firm׳s otherwise optimal strategy if a non-remanufacturable product were designed and produced.",Google Scholar (SerpAPI),89.6103896103896,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527315000031,Goal 12,0.06628736188619538,True,environmentally friendly consumption; sustainable product design

Construction of Efficient Heterogeneous Choice Designs: A New ApproachMarketing Science,"Liu, Q. & Tang, E",2015,,"Extant research on choice designs in marketing focuses on the construction of efficient homogeneous designs where all respondents get the same design. Sandor and Wedel (2005) were the first to propose the construction of efficient heterogeneous designs where different respondents or groups of respondents get different subdesigns, and demonstrate substantial efficiency gain when such heterogeneous designs are employed. A significant hurdle in widespread adoption of heterogeneous designs is the high computation cost, even when the number of subdesigns contained in the heterogeneous design is restricted to be small. In this paper we propose a new approach for the construction of efficient heterogeneous choice designs. In contrast to extant approaches that are based on an exact design framework where it is computationally prohibitive to do an exhaustive search to find a globally optimal design, our proposed approach is based on the continuous design framework where well-established mathematical theories can be leveraged for quick identification of a globally optimal design. The proposed approach makes it feasible to generate a highly efficient choice design that is completely heterogeneous--a unique subdesign for each individual respondent in the choice experiment. The proposed approach is the first in the marketing literature to find a completely heterogeneous choice design with assured high global design efficiency using the continuous design framework.

Marketing Communication Strategies and Consumer Financial Decision Making: Role of National CultureJournal of Marketing,"Petersen, J. & Kushwaha, T. & Kumar, V",2015,,"Consumers frequently make important financial decisions that have short- and long-term impacts on their welfare. The authors expect that these financial decisions are a function of consumers' past experiences and interactions with a financial services firm as well as consumers' long-term priorities (e.g., national culture). They determine how three cultural dimensions (long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity) and marketing communication type (promotion focused vs. prevention focused) affect three key consumer financial decisions: (1) savings rate, (2) use of credit, and (3) spending pattern. To do so, they empirically test both the direct effect of national culture on consumer financial decision making and its moderating effect on the link between a firm's marketing efforts and consumer financial decision making. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors develop and empirically test their hypotheses using a customer database from a multinational financial services firm based in the United Arab Emirates, with customers originating from 34 countries. They find that national culture directly affects consumer financial decision making and moderates the impact of marketing efforts by the financial services firm, which suggests that financial services firms should account for national culture when managing customers.",Crossref,94.73684210526315,10.1509/jm.13.0479,https://doi.org/10.1509/jm.13.0479,Goal 8,0.0549862896465505,True,local culture
The Value of Investing in Enterprise Risk ManagementJournal of Risk and Insurance,"Grace, M. & Leverty, T. & Phillips, R. & Shimpi, P",2015,,"A BSTRACT Prior studies show that enterprise risk management improves firm performance. This article investigates which aspects of enterprise risk management add value. We find that the use of economic capital models and dedicated risk managers improve operating performance. Requiring the dedicated risk manager report to the board of directors or to the chief executive officer (CEO) also increases value. The following combination of enterprise risk management initiatives yields the greatest increase in firm value: a simple economic capital model, a dedicated risk manager that is a cross‐functional committee, and requiring the risk manager report to the board or CEO.",Crossref,88.17204301075269,10.1111/jori.12022,https://doi.org/10.1111/jori.12022,Goal 15,0.01240084706411724,False,
How does IT Ambidexterity Impact Organizational AgilityInformation Systems Research,"Lee, O. & Sambamurthy, V. & Lim, K. & Wei, K",2015,,"Organizational agility is a significant business capability. Though there have been numerous studies about the effects of information technology (IT) capabilities on organizational agility, there has been limited attention on the enabling effects of IT ambidexterity, namely, the dual capacity to explore and exploit IT resources and practices. We propose that IT ambidexterity enhances organizational agility by facilitating operational ambidexterity, and that the magnitude of facilitation depends on the level of environmental dynamism. We test these relationships utilizing data from a large-scale, matched-pair field survey of business and IT executives. The results confirm that a firm’s IT ambidexterity does enhance its organizational agility through the mediated effects of operational ambidexterity, and that the dynamism of a firm’s environment affects these relationships.",Crossref,85.71428571428571,10.1287/isre.2015.0577,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2015.0577,Goal 17,0.02595372033228597,False,
Prospect Theory Explains Newsvendor Behavior: the Role of Reference PointsManagement Science,"Long, X. & Nasiry, J",2015,,"Current understanding in operations management is that prospect theory, as a theory of decision making under uncertainty, cannot systematically explain the ordering behavior observed in experiments on the newsvendor problem. We suggest this is because the newsvendor’s reference point is assumed to be the status quo, i.e., zero payoff. We propose an alternative based on newsvendor’s salient payoffs and show that prospect theory can, in fact, account for experimental results.

China’s Pseudo-monetary PolicyReview of Finance,"Deng, Y. & Morck, R. & Wu, J. & Yeung, B",2015,,"Abstract China’s monetary stimulation after the global financial crisis rapidly boosted its GDP. We argue that its efficacy derives from state control over its banking and corporate sectors. Beijing ordered state-owned banks to lend and they lent. Beijing ordered centrally-controlled state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to invest and they invested. Our data show much of this investment was highly leveraged purchases of real estate and land prices rises occurred where these SOEs were active buyers. This episode mimics the credit channel for monetary policy, but actually entails internal transfers between arms of the government pressuring on real estate prices upwards.",Crossref,86.79245283018868,10.1093/rof/rfu026,https://doi.org/10.1093/rof/rfu026,Goal 8,0.02411331967235186,False,
