"Wright, Nataliya. “When local learning scales: Entrepreneurs' initial users and market expansion.” Organization Science (Forthcoming).",Nataliya Wright,"Entering new markets is crucial for technology startups to scale, yet these ventures often face high uncertainty about demand in these markets. This study examines how the composition of initial users shapes startups’ new market growth amid such uncertainty. It theorizes that startups face a learning tradeoff when targeting a foreign market: Local initial users, who are more familiar to the startups, provide clearer signals due to shared language and norms; however, more representative foreign users provide more transferable insights about the target market. Using variation in feature timing on a product platform, this study finds that startups with a higher share of local initial users prior to platform launch experience greater growth in foreign users afterward. This effect is stronger when startups are based in more linguistically homogeneous countries and operate in globally standardized digital product categories, settings where the clarity benefits of local signals outweigh their transferability costs. In contrast to prior work suggesting that startups should begin with target users, this study reveals contexts when more familiar initial users can better foster new market growth and prevent premature scaling.",Organization Science,Forthcoming,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/when-local-learning-scales-entrepreneurs-initial-users-and-market-expansion,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.02812671661293873,False,

Although historically viewed as a uniquely human pursuit, art is increasingly created with artificial intelligence (AI). In the current work, we explore whether AI-generated art evokes the same emotional reactions and inspires the same interpersonal benefits as human-created art. Integrating appraisal theories of emotion and philosophical accounts of the arts, we propose that art believed to be AI-generated elicits less awe than human-created art, which in turn diminishes empathy. Across five preregistered studies (N = 1598), we find consistent support for these relationships across multiple artistic media (visual and literary) and participant samples (art museum patrons, online participants, and community members). Although art is often an effective conduit for fostering empathy, our findings reveal that AI-generated art may lack the capacity to inspire awe in the same way as human-created art, diminishing its ability to cultivate empathy. This work reveals that responses to art are shaped by beliefs about its creator, raising important questions about the emotional and social consequences of AI's growing role in creative domains.",Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Forthcoming,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/less-awe-some-art-how-ai-diminishes-empathic-power-arts,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.0145410940199342,False,

While nationalism can promote solidarity and progress, it also has the potential to deepen social divisions and fuel conflict-realities that organizations cannot ignore. In this paper, we propose a theory of organizational nationalism, which positions organizations not merely as passive responders to nationalist institutional pressures or geopolitical risks but as active agents in shaping nationalistic beliefs, values, and policies. Through theorizing how organizational nationalism manifests and functions, we offer insights into how organizations harness nationalism to motivate employees, cultivate consumer loyalty, and secure sociopolitical legitimacy, and how such engagement may eventually become an organizational commitment that shapes its nationalist character. This perspective fills a critical void in nationalism research by emphasizing the intermediary role played by organizations between the state and individual levels of nationalism. It also offers a unifying framework for the fragmented literature on nationalism in business, which spans topics from state influence on organizational forms to managing ""foreignness"" in multinational corporations.

To answer this question, the authors report an extensive multi-method investigation involving a grounded theory analysis of numerous consumer narratives and in-depth interviews, a field survey, a scale development study, a natural language processing analysis of more than 3 million Yelp reviews, a preregistered multi-factor causal experiment (and its preregistered replication), a blind comparison of hundreds of matched visual Instagram posts by third-party observers, and several small application studies. The findings converge in identifying three major psychological pillars of what makes consumption experiences feel special to consumers, each pillar involving different facets: (a) uniqueness, which arises from the rarity, novelty, irreproducibility, personalization, exclusivity, ephemerality, and surpassing of expectations of the experience; (b) meaningfulness, which pertains to the personal significance of the experience in terms of symbolism, relationships, self-affirmation, and self-transformation; and (c) authenticity, which relates to the perceived genuineness and realness of the experience in terms of its psychological proximity to some original source, iconicity, human sincerity, and connection to nature.

Firms operating in communities where the issue was more salient were more likely to respond, particularly when their dependence on community support was heightened by disruptions unrelated to the focal issue.

In this paper, we review existing literature and propose a conceptual framework that connects mind-wandering to consumer behavior through common triggers in consumer-relevant contexts that evoke diverse mental processes and culminate in consumption outcomes. We advocate for greater study of mind-wandering within consumer behavior and for its integration as a valuable perspective with applications across a wide range of marketplace contexts.",Consumer Psychology Review,2025,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/consumer-psychology-mind-wandering,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.01703159176928528,False,consumer behavior

Such a strategy ideates from observed cooling effects due to sulfate aerosol formation following volcanic eruptions. Solid mineral candidates have been proposed as a sulfate alternative, potentially lowering environmental risks like ozone depletion and absorption of radiation. The bulk of SAI modeling literature focuses on optimal deployment scenarios, in which practical constraints—microphysical, geopolitical, and economic—are not considered. Here, we explore several key micro- and macroscopic aspects of deployment that may directly increase risk, and the degree to which technical and governance approaches could be levied to offset it. We find that the risk and design space for SAI may be considerably constrained by factors like supply chains and governance. Logistical and technical considerations, most significantly difficulties in dispersing solid aerosols at scale in the desired size range, and the radiative properties of potentially formed aggregates, notably introduce uncertainties in the outcomes of solid-based SAI strategies more so than sulfate. We conclude that the design space for a “low-risk” SAI strategy, particularly with solid aerosol, may be more limited than current literature reflects.",Scientific Reports,2025,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/engineering-and-logistical-concerns-add-practical-limitations-stratospheric-0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.03890394170540639,False,

Methods: We link HCPCS codes to ICD condition categories using Local Coverage Determinations (LCD) and merge these with Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data to construct 21 condition-year disability indicators. We estimate two-way fixed-effects models with distributed lags (0–15 years) at the condition-year level, controlling for prevalence, mean age, educational attainment, and comorbidity counts, with year and condition fixed effects; standard errors are clustered by condition. The analytic file includes ∼1.50 million condition observations from 317,000 people. This LCD-anchored mapping is a conservative lower bound because many services are paid case-by-case without an LCD. Results: For 19 of 21 disability indicators, at least some lagged innovation coefficients are negative and statistically significant. The mean time from innovation to measurable disability reduction is 11.5 years, consistent with diffusion and time-to-benefit dynamics. Estimated 1997–2019 disability reductions attributable to prior innovation include: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipiency −21.3 % (largest effect), with double-digit declines for inability to work, Social Security recipiency, and school limitations; the median reduction across indicators is ∼7 %. Conclusions: Growth in Medicare-covered technology—measured via HCPCS/MCD linkages—is associated with meaningful, long-run reductions in multiple dimensions of disability. Findings highlight the importance of accounting for diffusion lags in health technology assessment and suggest value in monitoring coverage-enabled innovation alongside real-world outcomes.",Health Policy and Technology,2025,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/medicare-coveredinnovation-and-us-disability-1997-2019-evidence-healthcare,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.03325562469075313,False,

Given the lack of clear evidence that loss aversion results from differences in emotional reactions to gains versus losses, it is worth asking whether QT’s process account—which explains framing effects as resulting from attentional shifts and subsequent differences in memory retrieval—provides a psychological process account of the loss-aversion feature of PT.

In such a concentrated market, the entry or exit of a single platform can reallocate billions in ad spending, affecting businesses and users. TikTok’s temporary suspension in the United States in January 2025 provides a unique natural experiment to examine how the removal of a major player would shift advertising demand and supply on competitors, specifically Facebook and Instagram, revealing the degree of substitutability across platforms and the intensity of competition. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing advertising activity in the United States to other countries, we find that Meta ad volume and spend rose by 6.3% and 22.4%, as a result of the outage, without a corresponding increase in ad impressions. Consequently, Meta ad prices, as measured by cost per thousand impressions, jumped by 12.1%.

While companies commonly target based on demographic characteristics, recent cultural movements (e.g., #MeToo, Black Lives Matter) have heightened sensitivity to the differential treatment of certain demographic groups.

Fourteen experiments (N = 9,399), 13 supplemental studies (N = 7,065), and two Facebook A/B Tests (N = 513,151) reveal that when consumers learn or infer that they or others have been targeted based on demographic characteristics, fairness perceptions and brand support suffer (relative to broad advertising). To explain why, we propose a conceptual model based on the extent to which consumers view demographic targeting as discriminatory (i.e., differential treatment based on attributes that are irrelevant and/or uncontrollable), and whether the discrimination is perceived as intentional (i.e., knowingly or willingly bringing about an avoidable outcome). Consequently, factors that (a) improve relevance (i.e., whether belonging to the targeted segment is diagnostic of preferences) or (b) increase controllability (i.e., whether consumers themselves determine their membership in the targeted segment) attenuate perceptions of unfairness, as do variables that (c) reduce perceived intentionality (e.g., firm size, industry norms).",Journal of Consumer Research,2025,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/fairness-perceptions-demographic-targeting,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.018045599093477,False,disability discrimination; discrimination; discriminatory policies; discriminatory practices; eliminating discrimination

Interestingly, using semiparametric analysis, we find that this effect is non-linear: demand is not sensitive to promised delivery times of under a week, but drops quickly when delivery is expected to take over a week.

Finally, we consider workplace implications, finding that CWV moderates the relationship between managers’ antagonistic behavior and a range of employee outcomes, including motivation and job satisfaction. Overall, we argue that individuals’ folk theories of the social world (and CWV in particular) can help scholars more fully understand how basic dimensions of social perception relate to one another across perceivers.

We propose that sellers with higher attachment assign greater importance to a buyer’s caretaking attributes (e.g., intentions to care for and preserve the possession) and devote more time and effort to seeking out such buyers. Across four preregistered studies involving over 1,500 participants, we examined whether attachment led to such “caretaker effects” in real-world transactions and a controlled experiment. Study 1 surveyed recent sellers from online marketplaces, finding that those with higher attachment invested more effort in vetting buyers and weighing buyer caretaking attributes more heavily in their decisions. Studies 2 and 3 examined home sales, with surveys of recent home sellers and real estate agents replicating the caretaker effects in high-stakes transactions. Study 4 experimentally manipulated seller attachment in a novel simulated inbox paradigm, establishing a causal link between attachment and search/engagement behavior.

Similarly, double-entry carbon accounting is emerging in response to modern needs, particularly the need for emissions tracking in supply chains. The works in this issue were contributed by leading academic and practitioner experts on carbon accounting. The authors highlight key challenges, including Scope 3 emission double counting, reliance on third-party estimates, the allocation of emissions to products, the importance of integrating carbon accounting with traditional financial and managerial accounting systems, and the need for generally accepted carbon accounting principles. Drawing on Hatfield’s and Ijiri’s work, this introduction argues that double entry’s causal and accountability-focused nature make it well suited to driving corporate action on emissions reduction.",Foundations and Trends® in Accounting,2025,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/introduction-special-issue-perspectives-carbon-accounting-and-reporting,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.06989201630472659,True,carbon emissions; carbon pricing; emissions reduction; greenhouse gas emissions; industrial emissions

However, such experiments often violate the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), particularly SUTVA's ''no hidden treatments'' assumption, due to the shared data between algorithms being compared. This results in a novel form of bias, which we term ''symbiosis bias,'' where the performance of each algorithm is influenced by the training data generated by its competitor. In this paper, we investigate three experimental designs--cluster-randomized, data-diverted, and user-corpus co-diverted experiments--aimed at mitigating symbiosis bias. We present a theoretical model of symbiosis bias and simulate the impact of each design in dynamic recommendation environments. Our results show that while each design reduces symbiosis bias to some extent, they also introduce new challenges, such as reduced training data in data-diverted experiments. We further validate the existence of symbiosis bias using data from a large-scale A/B test conducted on a global recommender system, demonstrating that symbiosis bias affects treatment effect estimates in the field. Our findings provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to design experiments that accurately capture algorithmic performance without bias in treatment effect estimates introduced by shared data.",WWW '25: Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2025,2025,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/reducing-symbiosis-bias-through-better-ab-tests-recommendation-algorithms,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.02526917259915944,False,

Yet, women might also start out with lower offers upon which negotiations occur. A challenge in examining the latter explanation has been that salaries, not salary offers, have been previously available to researchers. In this study, we overcome this empirical challenge by obtaining data on more than 700,000 initial salary offers provided to job candidates in the United States from 2017 to 2020. This allows us to conduct the first wide-scale investigation of initial salary offers in the literature. We hypothesize that a gender offer gap exists and that it is larger in masculine-typed occupations than in feminine-typed occupations. Consistent with our arguments, we find a gender offer gap of 5.5%, net of detailed controls for job, employer, occupation, industry, location, and human capital characteristics. Additionally, we find suggestive evidence that the gender offer gap is larger in occupations with more masculine-typed tasks compared with occupations with more feminine-typed tasks.

Five large-scale, full-factorial experiments performing standard (zero-shot) similarity evaluation tasks using GPT-3, GPT-4, and Llama 3.1 document how several features of prompt architecture (order, label, framing, and justification) interact to produce methodological artifacts, a form of statistical bias. We find robust evidence that these four elements unduly affect responses across all models, and although we observe differences between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the changes are not necessarily for the better. Specifically, LLMs demonstrate both response-order bias and label bias, and framing and justification moderate these biases. We then test different strategies intended to reduce methodological artifacts. Specifying to the LLM that the order and labels of items have been randomized does not alleviate either response-order or label bias, and the use of uncommon labels reduces (but does not eliminate) label bias but exacerbates response-order bias in GPT-4 (and does not reduce either bias in Llama 3.1). By contrast, aggregating across prompts generated using a full factorial design eliminates response-order and label bias. Overall, these findings highlight the inherent fallibility of any individual prompt when using LLMs, as any prompt contains characteristics that may subtly interact with a multitude of hidden associations embedded in rich language data.",PLOS One,2025,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/prompt-architecture-induces-methodological-artifacts-large-language-models,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.006621198407786293,False,

We find that the impact of consuming personalized content (vs. other types of content or no content) on discussion intent varies depending on the strength of an individual’s identification with the domain. For weak identifiers, personalized content increases discussion intent, whereas for strong identifiers, it decreases intent. Process evidence highlights two underlying psychological forces: enhanced enjoyment of the domain and diminished confidence in domain knowledge.

Drupp, , James Rising, , Simon Dietz, , Ivan Rudik, , and Gernot Wagner, Gernot Wagner","Significance: Estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC)—the cost of one additional ton of CO2 emitted—is crucial for the analysis of climate change policies. Despite numerous recent studies investigating how fundamental aspects of model structure affect SCC evaluation, findings are scattered, making the relative importance of different modeling elements hard to establish. This paper synthesizes results from the published literature over the last 20 y, revealing a wide range of SCC estimates. However, survey evidence reveals experts believe estimates in the literature are too low due to a range of limitations in published values. Reweighting the literature to partly address these omissions more than doubles the SCC to $283. Abstract: Estimating the cost to society from a ton of CO2—termed the social cost of carbon (SCC)—requires connecting a model of the climate system with a representation of the economic and social effects of changes in climate, and the aggregation of diverse, uncertain impacts across both time and space. A growing literature has examined the effect of fundamental structural elements of the models supporting SCC calculations. This work has accumulated in a piecemeal fashion, leaving their relative importance unclear. Here, we perform a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the SCC, combining 1,823 estimates of the SCC from 147 studies with a survey of authors of these studies. The distribution of published 2020 SCC values is wide and substantially right-skewed, showing evidence of a heavy right tail (truncated mean of $132). ANOVA reveals important roles for the inclusion of persistent damages, the representation of the Earth system, and distributional weighting. However, our survey reveals that experts believe the literature underestimates the SCC due to an undersampling of model structures, incomplete characterization of damages, and high discount rates. To address this imbalance, we train a random forest model on variation in the literature and use it to generate a synthetic SCC distribution that more closely matches expert assessments of appropriate model structure and discounting. This synthetic distribution has a mean of $283 per ton CO2 for a 2020 pulse year (5% to 95% range: $32 to $874), higher than most official government estimates, including a 2023 update from the U.S. EPA. climate change │ social cost of carbon │ meta-analysis │ environmental economics",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2024,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/synthesis-evidence-yields-high-social-cost-carbon-due-structural-model-variation,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.09431169109825298,True,carbon emissions; carbon footprint; carbon pricing; climate change; climate finance; climate policy; environmental sustainability; greenhouse gas emissions

The greater the political polarization of a state, the more local restrictions the nascent U.S. hydraulic fracturing (fracking) industry—generally regarded as conservative—face in that state. Players in the industry thus seek interventions by conservative elites at the state government level. The dominance of conservative state legislators and the presence of affiliates of the right-leaning American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) are bound to strengthen the industry’s lobbying efforts in that state.

Consumers view demographic-based price discrimination as more fair when prices are determined by algorithms (vs. humans), which is driven by consumers feeling less judged by algorithms than by people, and believing algorithms’ decisions are less exploitative and more justified. Accordingly, we find that consumers’ favorable evaluations of algorithmic pricing attenuate under a more common and less contentious form of price discrimination (i.e., temporal-based) and when the price discrimination serves a prosocial goal.

This aspect is particularly significant in free-to-play (F2P) games, where the paid version often aims to enhance the player’s experience and to facilitate faster progression. In this paper, we leverage a large randomized control trial to assess the effect of dynamically adjusting game difficulty on players’ behavior and game monetization in the context of a popular F2P mobile game. The results highlight the intertwined dynamics of customer retention and monetization in such settings. As expected, offering players an easier game significantly decreases purchases in the specific round played — faced with an easier game, users do not need to resort to in-game purchases to make progress. However, because lowering the game difficulty increases both immediate engagement and long-term retention, lower difficulty levels result in a significant increase in customer spending both in the short and long run. We find substantial heterogeneity in the strength of these effects. Customers who are more prone to making progress in the game exhibit stronger effects in both the short and long run, whereas customers who previously spent money on the game exhibit stronger effects in long-term monetization.

Paying for ads that support far-right candidates, the reasoning went, could help Democrats win in the general elections because it is easier to beat extreme than moderate candidates. In the current research, we ask: how do consumers react to the use of “meddle ads”? On the one hand, because of rising levels of polarization, consumers might be accepting, or even supportive, of meddle ads. On the other hand, because meddle ads might come across as unethical and risky, consumers might be averse to their use.

We study two prevalent approaches for matching within organizations: centralized assignment by firm leaders and self-organization through market-like mechanisms. We provide a formal model of the strengths and weaknesses of both methods under different settings, incentives, and production technologies. The model highlights trade-offs between match-specific productivity and job satisfaction. We then measure these trade-offs with data from a large organization’s internal talent market. Firm-dictated matches are 33% more valuable than randomly assigned matches within job categories (using the firm’s preferred metric of quality). By contrast, preference-based matches (using deferred acceptance) are only 5% better than random but are ranked (on average) about 38 percentiles higher by the workforce.

In the early twentieth century, economists like Schultz (1943) analyzed agrarian economies and land-use issues. As agricultural productivity improved, production shifted more to manufacturing. Modern macroeconomics adapted with models featuring capital and labor, markets for goods, and equilibrium wages (Solow, 1956). Once again, productivity improvements have shifted the nature of production. In developed countries, the economy is no longer manufacturing-oriented.

Firms that demonstrate more rhetorical nationalism also have a better future financial return through increasing domestic profitability. Our study provides a theoretical framework for organizational study of nationalism and a new measure for firms’ rhetorical nationalism, and demonstrates that the rising rhetorical nationalism among Chinese firms is more strongly driven by firms’ motivations to appeal to domestic investors and consumers than to obtain government subsidies.

We propose a new approach for doing so, which we apply in the context of ridesharing. We model customer-level routines with Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes (GPs), leveraging a novel kernel that allows for flexible yet precise estimation of routines. These GPs are nested in inhomogeneous Poisson processes of usage, allowing us to estimate customers’ routines, and decompose their usage into routine and non-routine parts. We show the value of detecting routines for customer relationship management (CRM) in the context of ridesharing, where we find that routines are associated with higher future usage and activity rates, and more resilience to service failures. Moreover, we show how these outcomes vary by the types of routines customers have, and by whether trips are part of the customer’s routine, suggesting a role for routines in segmentation and targeting.",Journal of Marketing Research,2024,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/detecting-routines-applications-ridesharing-crm,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.008783159805052662,False,

A critical step in this process is resolving uncertainties surrounding the preference of the targeted venue and the nature of the relevant policy proposal. While existing studies emphasize a long-term trial-and-error process of policy learning, we focus on nascent industries and argue that ventures seek other information sources to resolve these uncertainties quickly. In particular, nascent industry groups are likely to perceive that the targeted venue will support their policy proposal if the targeted venue is ideologically distant from the venue that has enacted the restrictive regulations, if the targeted venue has recently supported other nascent industry groups’ similar policy proposals, or if the industry groups themselves are more exposed to industry peers’ success in promoting the same policy proposal in other jurisdictions. Under these conditions, the industry groups invest more to influence the targeted venue in response to restrictive regulations enacted by other venues.

Accordingly, we propose a machine learning hybrid pricing strategy with two levels of automation. First, a random forest model automatically allocates quotes to either the model or the salesperson based on its prediction of whose pricing would generate higher profits. Then, if the quote is allocated to the model, the model determines the price.

Although ordering and partitioning do not always improve choices separately, the authors use one field study and three experiments to identify the conditions that allow the combination to greatly improve health insurance decisions. Findings indicate that when options are ordered such that the best options appear at the beginning of the presented list, partitioning nudges consumers to focus on the best options. However, if the best options are not at the top of the list, partitioning discourages search and can impair consumers’ discovery of the best options.

Rising, , and Gernot Wagner, Gernot Wagner","How much will it cost to meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a global scale? The answer is critical for assessments of how to address climate change—affecting public support, political will, and policy choices. We find that the “bottom-up” estimation approach emphasized by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports considerably lower costs for emission reductions than leading “top-down” economic models. We also find that one core feature explains the vast majority of the difference: The bottom-up estimates include substantial reductions that appear to come at zero cost, or even at a savings, whereas the economic models assume no such “free lunch.” The fact that different methodological approaches produce different results may not be surprising. But that nearly all of the discrepancy loads on how much mitigation is seemingly costless raises important challenges for understanding and communicating the actual costs of reducing emissions. We compare two of the leading approaches for estimating marginal mitigation costs: the bottom-up, sector-by-sector approach employed by the IPCC and others (1, 2), and the top-down approach built into leading integrated assessment models (IAMs) in the climate-economics literature focused on benefit-cost analyses (3–5). Research on the “energy efficiency paradox” foreshadows how results may differ between approaches (6, 7). The paradox arises because adoption rates of energy efficiency investments typically fall short of predictions based on the cost savings estimated by bottom-up, engineering approaches. The reason is that a full accounting of direct and indirect costs is not taken into consideration. This might suggest that the IPCC and other bottom-up approaches understate the full costs of reducing GHG emissions. But there may also be concerns with top-down estimates, as broad analyses of environmental and climate policies find that costs are likely overstated (8–10).

Accruals introduced by conservatism increase each agent's stake in the future of the relationship when it matters most—when it is going badly. This makes staying in the relationship worthwhile for the agents, even if they plan to play a low payoff equilibrium in the second period to punish first-period free-riding. In turn, this allows the principal to use lower-powered (and less costly) team incentives in the first period of the relationship. In contrast, deferred compensation increases each agent's stake in the future of the relationship when it is going well, making it less efficient in fostering relationships.",Journal of Accounting and Economics,2023,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/accounting-conservatism-and-relational-contracting,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.007747895586060904,False,

The reduction in competition lowered click prices in the treated areas. Nonetheless, the effects on platform revenue growth were positive.

One reason for this dearth is the difficulty of measuring routines from transaction data, particularly when routines vary substantially across customers. The authors propose a new approach for doing so, which they apply in the context of ridesharing. They model customer-level routines with Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes, leveraging a novel kernel that allows for flexible yet precise estimation of routines. These Gaussian processes are nested in inhomogeneous Poisson processes of usage, allowing the authors to estimate customers’ routines and decompose their usage into routine and nonroutine parts.

We focus on the performance impact of two operational platform controls—demand-side admission control and supply-side repositioning control—considering the interplay with two practically important challenges: (i) spatial demand imbalances prevail for extended periods of time; and (ii) self-interested drivers strategically decide whether to join the network, and, if so, whether to reposition when not serving riders. Methodology/results: We develop and analyze the steady-state behavior of a novel game-theoretic fluid model of a two-location, four-route loss network. First, we fully characterize and compare the steady-state system equilibria under three control regimes, from minimal control to centralized control. Second, we provide insights on how and why platform control impacts equilibrium performance, notably with new findings on the role of admission control: the platform may find it optimal to strategically reject demand at the low-demand location even if drivers are in excess supply, to induce repositioning to the high-demand location. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this policy. Third, we derive upper bounds on the platform’s and drivers’ benefits caused by increased platform control; these are more significant under moderate capacity and significant cross-location demand imbalance. Managerial implications: Our results contribute important guidelines on the optimal operations of ride-hailing networks.

The policy relaxed housing equity constraints by extending government credit guarantee on insufficiently collateralized mortgages refinanced by intermediaries. Difference-in-difference tests based on program eligibility criteria reveal a significant increase in refinancing activity by HARP. More than three million eligible borrowers with primarily fixed-rate mortgages refinanced under HARP, receiving an average reduction of 1.45% in interest rate that amounts to $3,000 in annual savings. Durable spending by borrowers increased significantly after refinancing and regions more exposed to the program saw a relative increase in non-durable and durable consumer spending, a decline in foreclosure rates, and faster recovery in house prices. A variety of identification strategies suggest that competitive frictions in the refinancing market partly hampered the programâ€™s impact: the take-up rate and annual savings among those who refinanced were reduced by 10% to 20%. These effects were amplified for the most indebted borrowers, the key target of the program. These findings have implications for future policy interventions, pass-through of monetary policy through household balance-sheets and design of the mortgage market.",The Review of Economic Studies,2023,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/mortgage-refinancing-consumer-spending-and-competition-evidence-home-affordable,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01622305439848933,False,

These private market changes have coincided with a sharp decline in the number of firms going public—and when firms do go public, they are older and have raised more private capital. To understand these facts, we provide a systematic description of the differences between private and public firms. Next, we review several regulatory, technological, and competitive changes affecting both start-ups and investors that help explain how the trade-offs between going public and staying private have changed.

Importantly, adaptation comes at the cost of potential mismatch between the task-specific decision process and real-world processes that generate the target behaviors, such that asking more questions can reduce external validity. The authors used mouse and eye tracking to trace decision processes in time preference measurement and conjoint choice tasks.

We prove associated structural results on performance bounds and suboptimality gaps. Numerical experiments suggest that this new class of policies perform well, in particular in settings where the finite time horizon introduces significant exploration-exploitation tension into the problem.

The products’ quality is initially unknown, but consumers can sequentially learn it as online reviews accumulate. A salient aspect of our problem is that consumers, who want to purchase a product from a list of items displayed by the platform, incur a search cost while scrolling down the list. In this setting, the social learning dynamics, and hence the demand, is affected by the interplay of two unique features: substitution and ranking effects. The platform can influence the social learning dynamics by adjusting the ranking of the products to ultimately maximize the revenue collected from commission fees for sold items. To formulate the problem in a tractable form, we use a large-market (fluid) approximation and show that consumers eventually learn the products’ quality and characterize the speed of learning. Armed with this backing, we formulate the platform’s ranking problem in the fluid setting, where we assume the perspective of an uninformed platform that does not know the true quality vector but rather learns it through consumers’ review process. We compare different ranking policies based on the worst-case regret with respect to a fully informed platform benchmark. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, a greedy policy that maximizes immediate revenue by displaying products based on current ratings may incur highly suboptimal worst-case regret, as it may relegate the most profitable products to the lowest positions in the ranking if their current rating is not high enough. Second, a simple variant of the greedy policy can sufficiently alleviate the regret by balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Third, we characterize the critical level of search cost for which the regret does not grow exponentially with the number of products.",Operations Research,2022,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/social-learning-presence-choice,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.01756271841873066,False,

Katsikeas and Madan begin by taking a global perspective on scale use, demonstrating how the use and transferability of scales become even more problematic as researchers move across languages and cultures. They provide guidance for scale use that is particularly relevant to international marketing and marketing strategy research. Brendl and Calder acknowledge the use of well-formed scales as measured variables in psychological experiments, both as independent and dependent variables, but critique the use of multi-item scales to directly reveal latent unobservable constructs. As with any observed variable, scales should be used to test empirical predictions based on theoretical hypotheses about causal connections between theoretical constructs. Lehmann applauds the variability of multi-item scales and urges the exploration of the impact of various items within a scale. He advocates for flexibility and variation in multi-item scales related to psychological theories, simple three-item scales for manipulation checks, and one-item scales when measuring objective actions or beliefs. Baumgartner and Weijters focus on how to validate multi-item scales, particularly when used as mediators or moderators where a unique interpretation of the scale is so central.

To balance holding costs, service rates, resource requirement, and priority-induced idleness, we develop an index-based policy that we refer to as the idle-avoid 𝑐𝜇/𝑚 rule. For a two-class two-server model, where policy-induced idleness can have a big impact on system performance, we characterize cases where the idle-avoid 𝑐𝜇/𝑚 rule is optimal. In other cases, we establish a uniform performance bound on the amount of suboptimality incurred by the idle-avoid 𝑐𝜇/𝑚 rule. For general multiclass multiserver queues, we establish the asymptotic optimality of the idle-avoid 𝑐𝜇/𝑚 rule in the many-server regime. For long-time horizons, we show that the idle-avoid 𝑐𝜇/𝑚 is throughput optimal.

It begins with the premise that consumer marketers have long used ethnography as a component of their qualitative market research toolkit to inform their knowledge about and empathy for consumers. A question for market research educators who include ethnography in their curricula is if and how to teach the richness of anthropologically based approaches, especially given a decoupling of ethnographic method from anthropological theory in much consumer research practice. This discussion might also resonate with anthropology educators who are interested in the ways anthropology is applied in commercial settings. As a demonstration of a teaching mode rather than a research report, this paper describes how a consumer anthropology market research project is used experientially in the classroom to help marketing students learn and appreciate the application of both anthropological method and theory for brand-building.

How well proposed utilitarian protocols perform to maximize lives saved is unknown. We aimed to estimate the survival rates that would be associated with implementation of the New York State 2015 guidelines for ventilator triage, and to compare them to a first-come-first-served triage method. Methods We constructed a simulation model based on a modified version of the New York State 2015 guidelines compared to a first-come-first-served method under various hypothetical ventilator shortages. We included patients with SARs-CoV-2 infection admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation to three acute care hospitals in New York from 3/01/2020 and 5/27/2020. We estimated (1) survival rates, (2) number of excess deaths, (3) number of patients extubated early or not allocated a ventilator due to capacity constraints, (4) survival rates among patients not allocated a ventilator at triage or extubated early due to capacity constraints. Results 807 patients were included in the study. The simulation model based on a modified New York State policy did not decrease mortality, excess death or exclusion from ventilators compared to the first-come-first-served policy at every ventilator capacity we tested using COVID-19 surge cohort patients.

Inferring such transitions, which are generally unobserved to the firm, can offer the firms opportunities to be more relevant to their customers. In this paper, we demonstrate how a social network platform can leverage its longitudinal user data to identify which of its users are likely to be job seekers. Identifying job seekers is at the heart of the business model of professional social network platforms. Our proposed approach builds on the hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to recover the latent state of job search from noisy signals obtained from social network activity data. Specifically, we use the latent states of the HMM to fuse cross-sectional survey responses to a job-seeking status question with longitudinal user activity data, resulting in a partially HMM. Thus, in some time periods, and for some users, we observe a direct measure of the true job-seeking status. We demonstrate that the proposed model can predict not only which users are likely to be job seeking at any point in time but also what activities on the platform are associated with job search and how long the users have been job seeking. Furthermore, we find that targeting job seekers based on our proposed approach can lead to a 29% increase in profits of a targeting campaign relative to the approach that was used by the social network platform.",Management Science,2022,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/using-social-network-activity-data-identify-and-target-job-seekers,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.03508009311258554,False,

Participants were asked to choose 7 out of 21 design options to implement in the redevelopment project. The framework used for the design options stemmed from the Envision rating system. We analyzed the participants’ selection of the credits using generalized linear mixed models. Those that received the images portraying the future were significantly more likely to select design options that would reduce the risk of climate change and flooding. Images portraying sea-level rise had different effects depending on participant demographics. Such images increased the selection of design elements related to the climate and risk for participants identifying as female or as Democrat. For participants identifying as male or as Republican, the same images increased their selection of design elements to enhance community public space. The results demonstrate the positive effects of portraying the future in terms of encouraging focus on long-term sustainable design decisions for infrastructure systems.",Sustainability,2022,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/pictures-matter-how-images-projected-sea-level-rise-shape-long-term-sustainable,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.0960931747964616,True,climate change; climate change planning; climate governance; climate policy; institutional capacity for climate action; public awareness on climate; rising sea levels

We first argue and show that congruence between leadership gender and organizational claims is a key mechanism that drives job seekers’ interest. Specifically, many organizational claims are gender-typed, such that social claims activate the female stereotype, whereas business claims activate the male stereotype. Thus, whereas female-led organizations making social claims are gender-congruent, male-led firms making the same claims are gender-incongruent. Beyond demonstrating a general preference among job seekers for congruence, we also find that female job seekers are most interested in working for organizations that are simultaneously congruent and provide credible signals that they are fair and equitable employers.

Consequently, these hosts receive higher guest satisfaction ratings. Compared to hosts who want to earn cash, hosts motivated to meet people are more likely to keep hosting and to stay active on the platform, and hosts motivated to share beauty charge higher prices. As a result, these intrinsically motivated hosts have a higher customer lifetime value compared to those with a monetary motivation.

Notably, between 2018 and 2020, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been implemented in the European Union (EU), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) have been implemented/passed in the state of California in the United States. These regulations address both consumer data security and consumer privacy rights. In this monograph, we provide an overview of some of the key issues that are in play in consumer privacy and in empowering consumers with rights to manage the privacy of their data, viewed primarily in the context of online advertising-related actions of firms. The recent academic work on these topics already provides some important takeaways. Empirical studies, broadly speaking, show that fewer consumers share data with firms post-regulation and this leads to worse personalized marketing, i.e., the firms are at a handicap. Theoretically, a primary insight is that privacy regulations on using data affect the advertising/targeting layer directly and the product/pricing layer directly and/or indirectly; broadly speaking, consumers make data sharing choices by balancing the intrinsic and instrumental values of sharing data, and privacy regulations can generally be expected to benefit consumers at the expense of firms. We also discuss how consumers’ understanding of firms’ privacy policies and their impact can be enhanced, which is important for regulations to have their intended impact. We briefly discuss the development of privacy-preserving mechanisms for targeted advertising, industry interest in and adoption of which has been recently enhanced due to new regulations.

An analysis of intraday volumes for the S&P500 constituent stocks illustrates that (i) volume surprises, i.e., deviations from their respective forecasts, are correlated across stocks, and (ii) this correlation increases during the last few hours of the trading session. These observations could be attributed, in part, to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the growth of ETF, passive and systematic investment strategies; and, to the increased trading intensity of such strategies towards the end of the trading session, e.g., due to execution of mutual fund inflows/outflows that are benchmarked to the closing price on each day. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio execution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model that explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity providers only trade portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We find that due to cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a risk-neutral, cost minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a coupled manner, as opposed to a separable VWAP-like execution that is often assumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution of the various orders so as to be able to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity towards the end of the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from this optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as 6% for plausible model parameters.

To develop expected answers to these questions, we provide a series of exhibits of hypothetical transactions at, and financial reports for, the foreign subsidiary. We benchmark these theoretical insights against the survey responses and uncover several questionable managerial choices. First, although no performance measure is insulated from a currency impact, a large majority of senior managers and board members only review translated USD data, especially cash flows, that are fraught with significant measurement error. Second, companies are more likely to communicate, both inside and outside, the currency impact on net income and revenue but not on operating costs, operating cash flows and the foreign subsidiary’s balance sheet.

This research identifies a novel antecedent of this phenomenon. Ten studies (N = 2,967, 4 preregistered) find that the more people believe that appearance reveals character, the more confident they are in their appearance-based judgments, and therefore, the more they support the use of facial profiling technologies in law enforcement, education, and business. Specifically, people who believe that appearance reveals character support the use of facial profiling in general (Studies 1a and 1b), and even when they themselves are the target of profiling (Studies 1c and 1d). Experimentally inducing people to believe that appearance reveals character increases their support for facial profiling (Study 2), because it increases their confidence in the ability to make appearance-based judgments (Study 3). An intervention that undermines people’s confidence in their appearance-based judgments reduces their support for facial profiling (Study 4). The relationship between the lay theory and support for facial profiling is weaker among people with a growth mindset about personality, as facial profiling presumes a relatively unchanging character (Study 5a). This relationship is also weaker among people who believe in free will, as facial profiling presumes that individuals have limited free will (Study 5b). The appearance reveals character lay theory is a stronger predictor of support for profiling than analogous beliefs in other domains, such as the belief that Facebook likes reveal personality (Study 6).

This article explores consumers’ fairness perceptions regarding pricing decisions made in response to unique scenarios caused by the pandemic.We present three key findings: (i) maintaining prices following a product downgrade is viewed as less fair than maintaining prices following an equivalent decrease in costs; (ii) price decreases following a product downgrade are viewed as more fair when positioned as passing on cost savings rather than making up for decreased value; and (iii) price increases due to hygiene measures are perceived asmore fair when they result fromdirect (compared with indirect) cost changes.",Journal of the Association for Consumer Research,2022,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/pricing-fairness-pandemic-navigating-unintended-changes-value-or-cost,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01168496847269494,False,

In this paper, we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior and (2) trips within the city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data linear regression models, we first show that the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that, although zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 50%–90% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions are only 20%–50% for lower income communities. The large reductions in higher income communities are significantly driven by voluntary shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods, we show that our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: roughly, a 10% increase in mobility correlates with a 5% increase in the rate of infection. Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences in infection rates between high- and low-incomes areas within the city. Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable their inhabitants to increase compliance.",Management Science,2022,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4240,Google Scholar,100,Goal 10,0.05045898178990237,True,low income growth; social inequality

I suggest that understanding these principles can help us defer and deflect false beliefs from becoming entrenched in consumer minds and offer ways to leverage the four principles in the service of truth. I then propose that we broaden our focus in the study of false beliefs in three ways--by focusing on prevention of false beliefs rather than correction, by diversifying the dependent measures we study and by addressing the role of identity in false belief maintenance.

On the other hand, using limited capacity for customers who may never need the service in the future takes the capacity away from other more urgent customers who need it now. To understand this tension, we propose a multiserver queueing model with two customer classes: moderate and urgent. We allow customers to transition classes while waiting. In this setting, we characterize how moderate and urgent customers should be prioritized for service when proactive service for moderate customers is an option.

Specifically, we showed the patient an established clip of a gorilla passing through the screen, unnoticeable, in a classic inattentional blindness task, and identified a neuron in the right amygdala that fired only when the patient was aware of the gorilla. A different neuron coded the moment of insight, when the patient realized that she had missed the salient gorilla in previous trials. A third cluster of neurons fired when the patient was exposed to a post-clip question (“How many passes did you count?“) and reflected on the content. Neurons in this cluster altered their response behavior between unaware and aware states.
To investigate the interplay between the neurons' activity and characterize the potential cascade of information flow in the brain that leads to conscious awareness, we looked at the neurons' properties change, their activities’ alignment and the correlation across the cells. Examining the coherence between the spiking activity of the responsive neurons and the field potentials in neighboring sites we identified an alignment in the alpha and theta bands. This spike-field coherence hints at an involvement of attention and memory circuits in the perceptual awareness of the stimulus.
Taken together, our results suggest that conscious awareness of content emerges when there is alignment between individual neurons' activity and the local field potentials.

The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify these archetypes and train language models to infer social media response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on Twitter and Instagram). They find that consumer-selfie images receive more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selfies result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for brand selfies than for consumer selfies. A controlled lab experiment suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to selfie images.

Between March 2020 and May 2021, more than 70 million consumers with loans worth $2.3 trillion entered forbearance, missing $86 billion of their payments. The amount and incidence of debt relief is large enough to significantly dampen household debt distress and can help explain the absence of consumer defaults relative to the evolution of economic fundamentals. Borrowers’ self-selection is a powerful force in determining forbearance rates: relief flows to households suffering pandemic induced shocks who would have otherwise faced debt distress, including individuals with lower credit scores, lower incomes, and in regions with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 related economic shocks and higher shares of minorities. Moreover, about 55% of aggregate forbearance is provided to less creditworthy borrowers with above median income and higher debt balances – i.e., those excluded from income-based policies, such as the stimulus check program. Forbearance is designed as a temporary bridge to absorb liquidity shocks faced by households. A fifth of borrowers in forbearance continued making full payments, suggesting that forbearance acts as a credit line, allowing borrowers to “draw” on payment deferral if needed. About 60% of borrowers already exited forbearance, with most of them owing nothing or quickly repaying their postponed payments. On the other spectrum are more financially vulnerable and lower income borrowers who are still in forbearance with an accumulated debt overhang of about $60 billion ($3,900 per person/$14,200 for mortgage borrowers) that they are unlikely to repay quickly. We propose that unwinding this debt by spreading repayments over time may alleviate distressed households’ liquidity constraints. More than 20% of total debt relief was provided by the private sector outside of the government mandates. Exploiting a discontinuity in mortgage eligibility under the CARES Act we estimate that implicit government debt relief subsidies increase the rate of forbearance by about a third. Government relief is provided through private intermediaries, which differ in their propensity to supply relief, with shadow banks less likely to provide forbearance than traditional banks.","Brookings papers on economic activity, 2021-, Issue 2, p. 141",2021,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/government-and-private-household-debt-relief-during-covid-19,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.05477223090575825,True,debt distress; debt relief; debt restructuring; long-term debt sustainability

There were about six million foreclosures in the ten-year period after Lehman's collapse. Owners of multiple homes accounted for 25% of these foreclosures, while comprising only 13% of the market. Foreclosures displaced homeowners, with most of them moving at least once. Only a quarter of foreclosed households regained homeownership, taking an average four years to do so. Despite massive stimulus and debt relief policies, recovery was slow and varied dramatically across regions. House prices, consumption and unemployment remain below pre-crisis levels in about half of the zip codes in the U.S. Regions that recovered to pre-crisis levels took on average four to five years from the depths of the Great Recession. Regional variation in the extent and speed of recovery is strongly related to frictions affecting the pass-through of lower interest rates and debt relief to households including mortgage contract rigidity, refinancing constraints, and the organizational capacity of intermediaries to conduct loan renegotiations. A simple counterfactual based on our estimates suggest that, regardless of the narratives of the causes of housing boom and bust, alleviating these frictions could have reduced the relative foreclosure rate by more than half and resulted in up to twice as fast recovery of house prices, consumption, and employment.

By adapting to the market, consumers confirm the system, but when they resist, they accelerate conflicts in consumer experiences unless resistance is ideologically co-opted by the market. Three illustrative cases—upcycling, Zoom backgrounds, and the commercialization of TikTok—exemplify how the framework may be used to analyze consumption ideology and generate new research questions.

Finally, we find that macro risks significantly contribute to the variation in yields, bond risk premiums and the term premium.

A government would like to commit to the extent of future lockdowns in order to guarantee an economic outlook that supports efficient levels of investment into intermediate inputs. However, such a commitment is not credible, since investments are sunk at the time when the government chooses a lockdown. As a result, lockdown under lack of commitment deviates from the optimal policy. Rules that limit a government's lockdown discretion can improve social welfare, even in the presence of noncontractible information. Quantitatively, lack of commitment causes lockdown to be significantly more severe than is socially optimal.

Exchanges typically operate as electronic limit order books under a ""price-time"" priority rule and, in turn, can be modeled as multi-class FIFO queueing systems. A market with multiple exchanges can be thought of as a decentralized, parallel queueing system. Heterogeneous traders that submit limit orders select the exchange, i.e., the queue, in which to place their orders by trading off financial considerations against anticipated delays until their orders may fill. These limit orders can be thought of as jobs waiting for service. Simultaneously, traders that submit market orders select which exchange, i.e., queue, to direct their order. These market orders trigger instantaneous service completions of queued limit orders. In this way, the ""server"" is the aggregation of self-interested, atomistic traders submitting market orders. Taking into account the effect of investors' order routing decisions across exchanges, we find that the equilibrium of this decentralized market exhibits a state space collapse property, whereby: (a) the queue lengths at different exchanges are coupled in an intuitive manner; (b) the behavior of the market is captured through a one-dimensional process that can be viewed as a weighted aggregate queue length across all exchanges; and (c) the behavior at each exchange can be inferred via a mapping of the aggregated market depth process that takes into account the heterogeneous trader characteristics.

Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time.

Furthermore, consumers engage in more sustainable behaviors with high-end goods, owning them for longer and disposing of them in more environmentally friendly manners. Nevertheless, many consumers prefer to concentrate their budget on multiple ordinary goods in lieu of fewer high-end products partly because of product durability neglect, a failure to consider how long a product will last.

The platform's problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem with equilibrium constraints. We elucidate structural properties of supply equilibria and the corresponding utilities that emerge and establish a form of spatial decomposition, which allows us to localize the analysis to regions of movement. In turn, uncovering an appropriate knapsack structure to the platform's problem, we establish a crisp local characterization of the optimal prices and the corresponding supply response. In the optimal solution the platform applies different treatments to different locations. In some locations, prices are set so that supply and demand are perfectly matched; over-congestion is induced in other locations, and some less profitable locations are indirectly priced out. To obtain insights on the global structure of an optimal solution, we derive in quasi-closed form the optimal solution for a family of models characterized by a demand shock.

While prior studies on effects of sensory cues have examined scenarios where the sensory cues are encountered simultaneously, this research takes the novel approach of examining order effects of different sensory cues encountered sequentially. Specifically, four experiments examine the effects of sequentially encountered visual and olfactory sensory cues on food taste perception. We theorize and find empirical evidence that an olfactory cue benefits from first encountering a visual cue, but not vice versa. More specifically, encountering a visual cue before (vs. after) an olfactory cue (i.e., V-O vs. O-V sequence) results in more positive outcomes (higher taste perception, volume consumed, product recommendation, and choice). Moreover, ease of processing the olfactory cue mediates the effect of sensory cue sequence on taste perception.

In this work, we study the dynamic assignment of servers to different areas of a service system at the beginning of discrete time-intervals, i.e., shifts. The ability to reassign servers at discrete intervals, rather than continuously, introduces a partial flexibility that provides an opportunity for reducing the expected waiting time of customers. The problem is primarily motivated by an application to nurse staffing in emergency departments (EDs) where nurses can work in different areas of the ED, but their assignment can only be changed at the beginning of their shifts (typically 8-12 hours). To investigate the reassignment decision and its potential benefits, we consider a multiclass queueing system, where customers of each class differ in terms of their average service requirements and the holding cost incurred as they wait in the queues. We study a discrete-time fluid control problem to minimize transient holding costs over a finite horizon and show that an appropriate “translation” of the solution to the fluid control problem is asymptotically optimal for the original stochastic system. Through analysis of the fluid control problem we further obtain insights on the structure of “good” policies in the presence of the shift constraint. Leveraging these insights, we develop heuristic policies and use simulation to demonstrate their effectiveness in systems with dynamics often observed in EDs. We find that in a parameter regime relevant to our motivating application, the partial flexibility introduced by reassigning servers at the beginning of shifts can substantially reduce the expected cost of the system – by 10–50% in some parameter regimes – compared to the status-quo, dedicated staffing.",Operations Research,2021,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/dynamic-server-assignment-multiclass-queues-shifts-applications-nurse-staffing,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01850129935449848,False,

Recent advances in machine learning to predict patient deterioration have introduced the possibility of proactive transfer from the ward to the ICU. In this work, we study the problem of finding robust patient transfer policies which account for uncertainty in statistical estimates due to data limitations when optimizing to improve overall patient care. We propose a Markov Decision Process model to capture the evolution of patient health, where the states represent a measure of patient severity. Under fairly general assumptions, we show that an optimal transfer policy has a threshold structure, i.e., that it transfers all patients above a certain severity level to the ICU (subject to available capacity). As model parameters are typically determined based on statistical estimations from real-world data, they are inherently subject to misspecification and estimation errors. We account for this parameter uncertainty by deriving a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case reward across all plausible values of the model parameters. We show that the robust policy also has a threshold structure under fairly general assumptions. Moreover, it is more aggressive in transferring patients than the optimal nominal policy, which does not take into account parameter uncertainty. We present computational experiments using a dataset of hospitalizations at 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals, and present empirical evidence of the sensitivity of various hospital metrics (mortality, length-of-stay, average ICU occupancy) to small changes in the parameters. While threshold policies are a simplification of the actual complex sequence of decisions leading (or not) to a transfer to the ICU, our work provides useful insights into the impact of parameter uncertainty on deriving simple policies for proactive ICU transfer that have strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees.",Operations Research,2021,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/robustness-proactive-icu-transfer-policies-operations-research-appear,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.02899212553178162,False,

We introduce a benchmark model with heterogeneous workers and jobs that arrive over time. Job types are known to the platform, but worker types are unknown and must be learned by observing match outcomes. Workers depart after performing a certain number of jobs. The payoff from a match depends on the pair of types and the goal is to maximize the steady-state rate of accumulation of payoff. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of the structure of the optimal policy in the limit that each worker performs many jobs. The platform faces a trade-off for each worker between myopically maximizing payoffs (exploitation) and learning the type of the worker (\emph{exploration}). This creates a multitude of multi-armed bandit problems, one for each worker, coupled together by the constraint on the availability of jobs of different types (capacity constraints). We find that the platform should estimate a shadow price for each job type, and use the payoffs adjusted by these prices, first, to determine its learning goals and then, for each worker, (i) to balance learning with payoffs during the ""exploration phase"", and (ii) to myopically match after it has achieved its learning goals during the ""exploitation phase.""",,2021,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/matching-while-learning,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.02617521522930578,False,employment policies

Altman, , G.B Yom-Tov, , V. Ashtar, , and A. Rafaeli","Problem definition: Research in operations management has focused mainly on system-level load, ignoring the fact that service agents and customers express a variety of emotions that may impact service processes and outcomes. We introduce the concept of emotional load—the emotional demands that customer behaviors impose on service agents—to analyze how customer emotions affect service worker’s behavior. Academic/practical relevance: Most theories in organizational behavior literature predict that emotions expressed by customers reduce agent’s cognitive abilities and therefore, should reduce the agent’s speed (e.g., by increasing the service time required to serve an angry customer). We aim to shed light on the magnitude of that phenomenon while addressing important econometric challenges. We also investigate an important mechanism that drives this relation, namely agent effort. We discuss practical opportunities that arise from measuring emotional load and how it can be used to enhance productivity. Methodology: We measure the emotional load of agents using sentiment analysis tools that quantify positive/negative customer emotion expressions in an online chat-type contact center and link it to agent behavior: response time (RT) and the length and number of messages required to complete a service request. Identifying a causal effect of customer emotion on agent behavior using observational data is challenging because there are confounding factors associated with the complexity of service requests, which are related to both customer emotions and agent behavior. Our identification strategy uses panel data and exploits the variation across messages within a focal request using fixed effects to control for unobserved factors associated with case complexity. Instrumental variables are also used to address issues of measurement error and other endogeneity problems; the instruments are based on exogenous shocks to agent performance indicators that have been studied in the service operations literature. Results: Analyses show that emotional load created by negative customer emotions increases agent RT, the length of the agent messages (a measure of effort), and the required number of messages needed to complete a service request. Emotional load and agent RT reciprocally affect each other, with long agent RTs and a high number of messages producing more negative customer emotion. Managerial implications: We suggest that the emotional content in customer communications should be an important factor to consider when assigning workload to agents in a service system. Our study provides a rigorous methodology to measure the emotional content from customer text messages and objectively evaluate its associated workload. We discuss how this can be used to improve staffing decisions and dynamic workload routing through real-time monitoring of emotional load.",Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,2021,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0897,Google Scholar,100,Goal 17,0.005747610858843927,False,

We argue that the benefits crucially depend on the perceived intention of the firm. Workers use prosocial incentives as a signal about the firm's type and if used instrumentally in order to profit the firm, they can backfire. We show in an experiment in collaboration with an Italian firm, that monetary and prosocial incentives work very differently. While monetary incentives used instrumentally increase effort, instrumental charitable incentives backfire compared to non-instrumental incentives. This is especially true for non-prosocially-motivated workers who do not care about the prosocial cause but use prosocial incentives only as a signal about the firm.

Objectives: To evaluate the use of high-flow nasal cannula for COVID-19 on population-level mortality and ventilator availability.

Methods: We constructed dynamical (deterministic) simulation models of high-flow nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation use for COVID-19 in the United States. Model parameters were estimated through consensus based on published literature, local data, and experience. We had the following two outcomes: 1) cumulative number of deaths and 2) days without any available ventilators. We assessed the impact of various policies for the use of high-flow nasal cannula (with or without “early intubation”) versus a scenario in which high-flow nasal cannula was unavailable.

Results: The policy associated with the fewest deaths and the least time without available ventilators combined the use of high-flow nasal cannula for patients not urgently needing ventilators with the use of early mechanical ventilation for these patients when at least 10% of ventilator supply was not in use. At the national level, this strategy resulted in 10,000–40,000 fewer deaths than if high-flow nasal cannula were not available. In addition, with moderate national ventilator capacity (30,000–45,000 ventilators), this strategy led to up to 25 (11.8%) fewer days without available ventilators.

In particular, our results imply that a second price auction is an optimal mechanism when the seller only knows that the distribution of buyers has a monotone non-decreasing hazard rate, and guarantees at least 71.53% of optimal revenues against any distribution within this class. Furthermore, a second price auction is near-optimal when the class of admissible distributions is that of those with non-decreasing virtual values (aka regular). Under this class, it guarantees a fraction of 50% of optimal revenues and no mechanism can guarantee more than 55.6%.

This has led to increasing calls to book those investments to the balance sheet. Drawing on the relevant research, this paper proposes solutions for the accounting for intangible assets that contrast with balance sheet recognition, and compares them to current practice and the IFRS standards that dictate practice. Key is the recognition that an accounting solution comes from a double-entry system which produces an income statement as well as a balance sheet, and that has features that both enable and limit the information that can be conveyed about the value in intangible assets. In this system, asset recognition in the balance sheet must consider the effect on measurement in the income statement, for the income statement conveys value added to investment on the balance sheet. A determining feature is uncertainty about investment outcome and how that affects the income statement, so our solutions centre on accounting under uncertainty. Two other accounting features are added: There has to be an investment expenditure for balance sheet recognition and that expenditure must be separately identifiable from transactions. These features rather than the tangible-intangible asset dichotomy lead to the prescribed solutions.",,2020,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/accounting-intangible-assets-suggested-solutions,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01599498092216856,False,

To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state’s social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state’s own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the “loss from anarchy” in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers.

Further, we contend the gender pay gap may arise due to cultural beliefs about the appropriateness of women and men for STEM professions that shape individuals’ self-beliefs in the form of self-efficacy. Using a three-wave NSF-funded longitudinal survey of 559 engineering and computer science students that graduated from over two dozen institutions in the United States between 2015 and 2017, we find women earn less than men, net of human capital factors like engineering degree and grade point average, and that the influence of gender on starting salaries is associated with self-efficacy. We find no support for a competing hypothesis that the importance placed on pay explains the pay gap; there is no gender difference in reported importance placed on pay. We also find no support for the idea that women earn less because they place more importance on workplace culture; women do value workplace culture more, but those who hold such values earn more rather than less.

Design: Retrospective study using an instrumental variable approach to remove potential biases from unobserved differences in illness severity for patients admitted to the step-down unit after ICU discharge. Setting: Ten hospitals in an integrated healthcare delivery system in Northern California. Patients: Eleven-thousand fifty-eight episodes involving patients who were admitted via emergency departments to a medical service from July 2010 to June 2011, were admitted to the ICU at least once during their hospitalization, and were discharged from the ICU to the step-down unit or the ward. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Using congestion in the step-down unit as an instrumental variable, we quantified the impact of step-down unit care in terms of clinical and operational outcomes. On average, for ICU patients with lower illness severity, we found that availability of step-down unit care was associated with an absolute decrease in the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days of 3.9% (95% CI, 3.6–4.1%). We did not find statistically significant effects on other outcomes. For ICU patients with higher illness severity, we found that availability of step-down unit care was associated with an absolute decrease in in-hospital mortality of 2.5% (95% CI, 2.3–2.6%), a decrease in remaining hospital length-of-stay of 1.1 days (95% CI, 1.0–1.2 d), and a decrease in the likelihood of ICU readmission within 5 days of 3.6% (95% CI, 3.3–3.8%). Conclusions: This study shows that there exists a subset of patients discharged from the ICU who may benefit from care in an step-down unit relative to that in the ward.

Group decisions add dynamic interactions that further complicate the choice process and frequently result in outcomes that are suboptimal for both the individual and the collective. We show that an implementation of a Blockchain protocol improves individuals’ decision strategies and increases the alignment between desires and outcomes. The Blockchain protocol affords (1) a distributed decision, (2) the ability to iterate repeatedly over a choice, (3) the use of feedback and corrective inputs, and (4) the quantification of intrinsic choice attributes (i.e., greed, desire for fairness, etc.). We test our protocol’s performance in the context of the Public Goods Game. The game, a generalized version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, allows players to maximize their own gain or act in ways that benefit the collective. Empirical evidence shows that participants’ cooperation in the game typically decreases once a single player favors their own interest at the expense of others’. In our Blockchain implementation, “smart contracts” are used to safeguard individuals against losses and, consequently, encourage contributions to the public good. Across different tested simulations, the Blockchain protocol increases both the overall trust among the participants and their profits. Agents decision strategies remain flexible while they act as each other’s source of accountability (which can be seen as formalized distributed “Ulysses contract”). To highlight the contribution of our protocol to society at large we incorporated an entity that represents the public good. This benevolent independent beneficiary of the contributions of all participants (e.g., a charity organization or a tax system) maximized its payoffs when the Blockchain protocol was implemented. We provide a formalized implementation of the Blockchain protocol and discuss potential applications that could benefit society by more accurately capturing individuals’ preferences. For example, the protocol could help maximize profits in groups, facilitate democratic election that better reflect the public opinion, or enable group decision in circumstances where a balance between anonymity, diverse opinions, personal preferences and loss-aversion play a role.",Frontiers in Blockchain,2020,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/using-blockchain-decision-making-benefits-public-good,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01549466057407,False,

In new product development projects, this tension guides critical choices about continuity or change concerning product attributes and team composition. Research suggests these choices interact, but it is not clear whether they are complements or substitutes and if the level of change in one should match or not the level of change in the other. In this article, we examine the interaction between product attribute change, team change, and a new team-level factor, which we term stream concentration, as it captures differences among team members in terms of familiarity with the knowledge domain of the new product being developed. We measure stream concentration as team members’ prior NPD experience within a given set of products and assess its impacts on the management of change in new product development projects using longitudinal data from the music industry. We analyze 2621 new product development projects between 1962 and 2008 involving 34,265 distinct team members. Results show that stream concentration is a critical factor in new product development projects that, together with product attributes and team composition, affects new product performance.

However, they appear disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positions, a problem known as the “bamboo ceiling.” It remains unclear why this problem exists and whether it applies to all Asians or only particular Asian subgroups. To investigate the mechanisms and scope of the problem, we compared the leadership attainment of the two largest Asian subgroups in the United States: East Asians (e.g., Chinese) and South Asians (e.g., Indians). Across nine studies (n = 11,030) using mixed methods (archival analyses of chief executive officers, field surveys in large US companies, student leader nominations and elections, and experiments), East Asians were less likely than South Asians and whites to attain leadership positions, whereas South Asians were more likely than whites to do so. To understand why the bamboo ceiling exists for East Asians but not South Asians, we examined three categories of mechanisms—prejudice (intergroup), motivation (intrapersonal), and assertiveness (interpersonal)—while controlling for demographics (e.g., birth country, English fluency, education, socioeconomic status). Analyses revealed that East Asians faced less prejudice than South Asians and were equally motivated by work and leadership as South Asians. However, East Asians were lower in assertiveness, which consistently mediated the leadership attainment gap between East Asians and South Asians. These results suggest that East Asians hit the bamboo ceiling because their low assertiveness is incongruent with American norms concerning how leaders should communicate.

Optionality also predicts the future growth component of firm value to be a decreasing function of earnings among highly profitable firms. More generally, the dynamic options model implies an earnings-to-value mapping that can be non-monotonic even over narrow earnings intervals.

This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates.

However, these inevitable accounting effects can be exploited to provide information about uncertainty, though not by a balance-sheet approach alone. Rather, balance sheet recognition and measurement criteria are established by consideration of the impact of uncertainty on matching and mismatching in the income statement.

Focusing on a repeated moral hazard scenario with two independent periods and a risk-neutral agent with limited liability, we conduct a theoretical investigation to understand which effort profiles the firm can expect under the optimal contract. We show that various effort profiles that may give the appearance of being sub-optimal, such as postponing effort exertion (“hockey stick”) and not exerting effort after a bad or a good initial demand outcome (“giving up” and “resting on laurels,” respectively) may indeed be induced optimally by the firm. The reason is that, under certain conditions that depend on how severe the contracting frictions are and how effective effort exertion is in increasing demand, the firm wants to concentrate rewards on extreme demand outcomes; this induces gaming and reduces expected demand, but also makes motivating effort cheaper thus saving on incentive payments. On introducing dependence between time periods, such as when the agent can transfer demands between periods, this insight continues to hold and, furthermore, “hockey stick,” “giving up” and “resting on laurels” can be optimal for the firm even under repeated short time horizon contracting. Our results imply that one must carefully consider the setting and environmental factors when making inferences about contract effectiveness from dynamic effort profiles of agents.",Journal of Marketing Research,2020,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/multiperiod-contracting-and-salesperson-effort-profiles-optimality-hockey-stick,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.008020954611416716,False,

This work contributes to the debate by collecting an extensive dataset of shootouts which corroborates an advantage for the first shooter, albeit with a smaller effect than what has been documented in previous research. To evaluate the impact of alternative ordering of shots, we model shootouts as a probability network, calibrate it using the data from the traditional ordering, and use the model to conduct counterfactual analysis.

In response to losing competitiveness, laggard firms must release obsolete resources and increase experimentation with new resources. Limiting the pace and efficiency at which they can do so impedes their ability to innovate and challenge leaders. I explore these ideas empirically by exploiting the staggered adoption of employment protection laws by U.S. state courts that were intended to protect employees but also had the effect of limiting the ability of laggards to reconfigure human resources. Increasing employment protection indeed results in fewer and less impactful patents by laggards, driven by a decrease in radical innovations that require significant resource adjustments. By distinguishing between firms that have the incentive to adjust resources versus those that do not, the study articulates the process and the black box between constraints on resource adjustment and innovation in a way that explains why the relationship is more complex than a simple average effect. More broadly, this study proposes a firmÃ¢â?¬â„¢s competitive position as a critical yet neglected contingency, complementing the prior emphasis on industry- and task-level considerations.",Organization Science,2020,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/penalizing-underdogs-employment-protection-and-competitive-dynamics-firm,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.05360278917222212,True,employment policies; innovation

The massive amount of search query data available today has the potential to provide valuable information on consumer preferences. In order to unlock this potential, it is necessary to understand how consumers translate their preferences into search queries. Strategic consumers should attempt to maximize the information content of the search results, conditional on a set of beliefs on how the search engine operates. We show using field data that optimal queries may exclude some of the terms that are more relevant to the consumer, potentially at the expense of less relevant terms. In two incentive-aligned lab experiments, we find that consumers have some ability to strategically omit relevant terms when forming their search queries, but that their search queries tend to be suboptimal. In a third incentive-aligned experiment, we find that consumers’ beliefs on how the search engine operates tend to be inaccurate.

There, we observe no long-term impact on the quantity of entrepreneurship but a marked decline in the rate of formation of growth-oriented startups over time.

Why would high-status actors adopt items traditionally associated with low-status groups? Using a signaling perspective to explain this phenomenon, the authors suggest that elites sometimes adopt items associated with low-status groups as a costly signal to distinguish themselves from middle-status individuals. As a result, signals sometimes trickle round, moving directly from the lower to the upper class, before diffusing to the middle class. Furthermore, consistent with a signaling perspective, the presence of multiple signaling dimensions facilitates this effect, enabling the highs to mix and match high and low signals and differentiate themselves.

Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize cumulative expected earnings over some planning horizon of length T. To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation). The gambler's policy is measured relative to a (static) oracle that knows the identity of the best arm a priori. The gap in performance between the former and latter is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small the regret can be as a function of problem primitives (hardness of the problem, typically measured as the distinguishability of the best arm) and the game horizon (T). This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time. The uncertainty in this set up is purely spatial and essentially amounts to identifying the optimal arm. We complement this literature by developing a flexible nonparametric model for temporal uncertainty in the rewards. The extent of temporal uncertainty is measured via the cumulative mean change of the rewards over the horizon, a metric we refer to as temporal variation, and regret is measured relative to a (dynamic) oracle that plays the pointwise optimal action at each instant in time. Assuming that nature can choose any sequence of mean rewards such that their temporal variation does not exceed V (viewed as a temporal uncertainty budget), we characterize the complexity of this MAB game via the minimax regret which depends on V (the hardness of the problem) the horizon length T and the number of arms K. When the uncertainty budget V is not known a priori, we develop a family of ""master slave"" policies that adapt to the realized variation in rewards and provide numerical evidence suggesting that these policies are nearly minimax optimal.",Stochastic Systems,2019,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/optimal-exploration-exploitation-multi-armed-bandit-problem-non-stationary-rewards,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.01476470983120153,False,

Koszegi and Rabin (2009) generalize the static model to a dynamic setting by assuming that the agent experiences both contemporaneous gain-loss utility over present consumption and prospective gain-loss utility over changes in expectations about future consumption. Moreover, the authors generalize the outcome-wise ""static comparison"" of gain-loss utility to a percentile-wise ""ordered comparison,"" in which the agent compares consumption outcomes at each percentile. This paper generalizes the static comparison slightly differently to, what I call, a ""separated comparison."" Under the separated comparison, the agent compares each consumption outcome but experiences gain-loss utility only over uncertainty that has been realized, by considering it separately from remaining future uncertainty. Effectively, the separated comparison modifies the static comparison by considering potential non-independence of the prior and updated expectations about future consumption. Thus, it reduces to the static comparison for independent prior and updated expectations and is zero if these happen to be the same. Moreover, it yields simple, tractable, and well-behaved equilibria in a wide class of economic models, because it preserves an outcome-wise nature, which makes it linear and dynamically similar to contemporaneous gain-loss utility.",Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,2019,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/prospective-gain-loss-utility-ordered-versus-separated-comparison,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.0195842055093138,False,

However, to decide when defaults should be used instead of other choice architecture tools, policy-makers must know how effective defaults are and when and why their effectiveness varies. To answer these questions, we conduct a literature search and meta-analysis of the 58 default studies (pooled n = 73,675) that fit our criteria. While our analysis reveals a considerable influence of defaults (d = 0.68, 95% confidence interval = 0.53–0.83), we also discover substantial variation: the majority of default studies find positive effects, but several do not find a significant effect, and two even demonstrate negative effects. To explain this variability, we draw on existing theoretical frameworks to examine the drivers of disparity in effectiveness. Our analysis reveals two factors that partially account for the variability in defaults’ effectiveness. First, we find that defaults in consumer domains are more effective and in environmental domains are less effective. Second, we find that defaults are more effective when they operate through endorsement (defaults that are seen as conveying what the choice architect thinks the decision-maker should do) or endowment (defaults that are seen as reflecting the status quo). We end with a discussion of possible directions for a future research program on defaults, including potential additional moderators, and implications for policy-makers interested in the implementation and evaluation of defaults.",Behavioural Public Policy,2019,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/when-and-why-defaults-influence-decisions-meta-analysis-default-effects,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.008171157539172918,False,

While decision making under risk and uncertainty is the forte of financial economics, important insights from pricing financial assets do not typically inform standard climate–economy models. Here, we introduce EZ-Climate, a simple recursive dynamic asset pricing model that allows for a calibration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) price path based on probabilistic assumptions around climate damages. Atmospheric CO2 is the “asset” with a negative expected return. The economic model focuses on society’s willingness to substitute consumption across time and across uncertain states of nature, enabled by an Epstein–Zin (EZ) specification that delinks preferences over risk from intertemporal substitution. In contrast to most modeled CO2 price paths, EZ-Climate suggests a high price today that is expected to decline over time as the “insurance” value of mitigation declines and technological change makes emissions cuts cheaper. Second, higher risk aversion increases both the CO2 price and the risk premium relative to expected damages. Lastly, our model suggests large costs associated with delays in pricing CO2 emissions. In our base case, delaying implementation by 1 y leads to annual consumption losses of over 2%, a cost that roughly increases with the square of time per additional year of delay.

Methods: We estimated two-way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the disease- and countryspecific age-standardized YLL rate. The models control for the average decline in the YLL rate in each country and from each disease. Results: One additional drug launch 0–11 y before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85 y YLL rate (YLL85) in year t by 3.0%, and one additional drug launch ≥12 y before year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%.

We estimate two-way (by country and disease) fixed-effects models of several measures of disability for 31 diseases in eleven European countries using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and from other sources.

The first type of cost offset—from prescription drug use—is primarily about the effect of changes in drug quantity (e.g. due to changes in out-of-pocket drug costs) on other medical costs. The second type of cost offset—the cost offset from prescription drug innovation—is primarily about the effect of prescription drug quality on other medical costs. Two previous studies found that pharmaceutical innovation reduced hospitalization, and that the reduction in hospital cost from the use of newer drugs was considerably greater than the innovation-induced increase in pharmaceutical expenditure. In this study, we reexamine the impact that pharmaceutical innovation has had on hospitalization, employing a different type of 2-way fixed effects research design. We estimate the impact that new drug launches that occurred during the period 1982-2015 had on hospitalization in 2015 for 67 diseases in 15 OECD countries. Our models include both country fixed effects and disease fixed effects, which control for the average propensity of people to be hospitalized in each country and from each disease.

I show that decision makers are most apt to favor male network contacts in exchanges involving a third party when considering whether to connect a contact in a male-typed occupation. Decision makers do not display this gender bias in exchanges that do not involve a third party or when sharing connections to potential clients with contacts in gender-neutral or female-typed occupations. This setting offers a unique opportunity to compare gender inequality in exchanges involving a third party with cases that do not involve a third party, providing direct evidence of the effects of audiences or third parties for gender inequality.",,2019,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/gender-role-incongruity-and-audience-based-gender-bias-examination-networking,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.1343123619565004,True,gender bias; gender discrimination; gender disparities; gender equality; gender equity; gender inequality; gender norms; gender-sensitive policies

Yom-Tov, and Carri Chan, Carri Chan","Admission control and service rate speedup may be used during periods of congestion to minimize customer waiting in different service settings. In a healthcare setting, this can mean sending patients to alternative care facilities that may take more time and/or provide less ideal treatment. While waiting can be detrimental to patient outcomes, strategies used to control congestion can also be costly. In this work, we examine a multi-server queueing system that considers both admission control and speedup. We use dynamic programming to characterize properties of the optimal control and find that in some instances the optimal policy has a simple form of a threshold policy. Leveraging this insight, we examine a queueing system where speedup is used when the number of customers (patients) in the system exceeds some threshold and admission control is used when that number exceeds some (potentially different) threshold. Using a fluid model and a stochastic loss model, we develop a methodology to derive approximations for the probability that speedup will be applied, the probability that admission control will be applied and the expected queue length customers experience. We use the approximations as the basis for a greedy heuristic to derive a near optimal solution to the original stochastic optimization problem. We use simulation to demonstrate the quality of these approximations and find that they can be quite accurate and robust. This analysis can provide insight to managers deciding how to balance admission control and speedup in service settings: when and to what extent to use each.",Queueing Systems,2019,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/balancing-admission-control-speedup-and-waiting-service-systems,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.008804109346903372,False,

Cachon, , and S. Gallino","What is the relationship between inventory and sales? Clearly, inventory could increase sales: expanding inventory creates more choice (options, colors, etc.) and might signal a popular/desirable product. Or, inventory might encourage a consumer to continue her search (e.g., on the theory that she can return if nothing better is found), thereby decreasing sales (a scarcity effect). We seek to identify these effects in U.S. automobile sales. Our primary research challenge is the endogenous relationship between inventory and sales — e.g., dealers influence their inventory in anticipation of demand. Hence, our estimation strategy relies on weather shocks at upstream production facilities to create exogenous variation in downstream dealership inventory. We find that the impact of adding a vehicle of a particular model to a dealer’s lot depends on which cars the dealer already has. If the added vehicle expands the available set of sub-models (e.g., adding a four-door among a set that is exclusively two-door), then sales increase. But if the added vehicle is of the same sub-model as an existing vehicle, then sales actually decrease. Hence, expanding variety across sub-models should be the first priority when adding inventory—adding inventory within a sub-model is actually detrimental. In fact, given how vehicles were allocated to dealerships in practice, we find that adding inventory actually lowered sales. However, our data indicate that there could be a substantial benefit from the implementation of a “maximizes variety, minimize duplication” allocation strategy: sales increase by 4.4 percent without changing the number of vehicles at each dealership, and a 5.2 percent is possible if inventory is allowed to decrease by 2.8 percent (and no more than 10 percent at any one dealer).",Management Science,2019,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2286800,Google Scholar,100,Goal 1,0.01298331963304252,False,

Taken together, the evidence suggests that fair value accounting has the potential to increase systemic risk through the explicit inclusion of volatile fair value estimates in regulatory bank capital adequacy assessments. I do not, however, find evidence of fair value accounting impacting systemic risk in its information role; that is, by providing information to a bank's external stakeholders about its financial position and performance. I also show that higher fair value volatility of investment securities, lower bank capital, and larger AFS security holdings increase banks' marginal contribution to systemic risk.

The positive benefits of equity outcomes only evidence themselves after year 6 of age, suggesting more differentiated firms may take longer to prove themselves.

We find that both liberals and conservatives view life as zero-sum when it benefits them to do so. Whereas conservatives exhibit zero-sum thinking when the status quo is challenged, liberals do so when the status quo is being upheld. Consequently, conservatives view social inequalities--where the status quo is frequently challenged--as zero-sum, but liberals view economic inequalities--where the status quo has remained relatively unchallenged in past decades--as such. Overall, these findings suggest potentially important ideological differences in perceptions of conflict--differences that are likely to have implications for understanding political divides in the United States and the difficulty of reaching bipartisan legislation.",Science Advances,2019,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/politics-zero-sum-thinking-relationship-between-political-ideology-and-belief-life,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01696103605677634,False,

Many, however, struggle with motivating employees to develop innovative ideas that may benefit the firm, especially when the standard tasks for which employees are hired, measured and incentivized do not explicitly include innovation. Prior analytical research posits that low-powered incentives can motivate employees to pursue innovation opportunities by reducing the pressure to deliver on performance measures associated with their standard tasks included in the incentive contract. Using data from a Chinese manufacturing company where employment contracts for standard tasks exhibit significant variation in terms of composition of fixed and variable components of pay, we examine whether the structure of incentive contracts for the standard tasks influences employees’ propensity to engage in innovation activities. We find that employees under fixed-pay contracts are more likely to engage in innovation ideas benefiting the firm relative to employees under variable-pay contracts. Moreover, such efforts are concentrated on innovation ideas that are not specific to the standard task performed by the proposing employee, but are applicable to issues of greater breadth for the firm and/or with a long term view. We perform a battery of additional tests to rule out endogeneity concerns, to validate the robustness of our findings, and to examine the impact of contract structure on important organizational outcomes.

Ten studies find that relative to considering alternatives that are similar to the target, considering dissimilar alternatives leads to a greater decrease in purchase intent for the target. When consumers consider a dissimilar alternative, a competing nonfocal goal is activated, which decreases the perceived importance of the focal goal served by the target option. Consistent with this proposed mechanism, the relative importance of the focal goal versus the nonfocal goal mediates the effect of alternative type on purchase intent, and the effect attenuates when the focal goal is shielded from activation of competing goals.

In our main model, conservatism results in smaller expected payouts to the manager (agent) in early periods and larger expected payouts in later periods. Conservatism shifts (ambiguous) evidence that might be used to recognize good performance in early periods to later periods. In later periods, good performance is less informative, since good news might mean good current period performance and might also mean good prior period performance whose recognition was delayed. Because of the intertemporal shift in the information content of performance measures, incentives provided in future periods can spillback to early periods, making conservatism preferred by the principal (shareholders). We also study an extension in which the principal learns about the firm over time. In the learning model, conservatism is optimal because it reduces the expected payment in the first period when providing incentive is more difficult than it is in the second period. In a final extension, we study overlapping projects that give rise to a multi-task setting. In the multi-task setting, unbiased accounting is preferred to a maximally biased one (conservative or aggressive) when bias introduces so much measurement heterogeneity that one of the otherwise identical projects becomes a significant ""bottleneck.""

Spending responses to income are typically explained by households' capital structures: households that hold little or no liquid wealth have to consume hand-to-mouth.

To that end, we analyze cash holding responses to income payments inspired by the corporate finance literature. However, we find that individuals' cash responses are consistent with standard models without illiquid savings and neither present nor future liquidity constraints being frequently binding.

Little is known, however, about why Americans so strongly believe in economic mobility. In five studies (N=3112, including two pre-registered studies, one with a large, income-stratified sample), I examine the relationship between economic inequality and the belief in economic mobility. I find that people (accurately) perceive a negative relationship between economic inequality and economic mobility, and that this is due to the attributions they make about wealth and poverty. As economic inequality rises, people increasingly attribute economic success and failure to external factors that are beyond a person's control (vs. internal dispositions), and therefore expect economic mobility to drop. As a consequence, people's tendency to underestimate economic inequality reinforces their belief in economic mobility.

Three studies (one correlational, two experimental) with more than 600 participants holding more than 10,000 secrets demonstrate that being confided in brings relational benefits, but is also a burden. The closer one is to the confider, the more one's mind wanders toward the secret, predicting increased feelings of intimacy, but also burden. The more a secret has overlap with one's own social network, the more one conceals the secret on the other's behalf, predicting increased feelings of burden. Experimentally shifting the mentally accessible framing of the secret (to focus on closeness or overlap) influences attributions made about being confided in, as does shifting the meaning people infer for why their mind wanders toward the other's secret (i.e., mind-wandering as revisiting or as problem-solving). Being confided in can be both a burden and a boost — pathways that operate simultaneously and independently from each other.",Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/benefits-and-burdens-keeping-others-secrets-0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.006228853279117457,False,

Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms’ board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact of MEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find that MEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage.",Journal of Marketing,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/when-and-how-board-members-marketing-experience-facilitate-firm-growth,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.02806845773095663,False,

Building on research showing that affect is inherently a decision-making system of the present, we propose that scope insensitivity is more likely to be observed in decisions that are psychologically proximate to the immediate self. Consistent with this proposition, results from seven experiments (and two replications) show that scope insensitivity is more prevalent in decisions that are temporally proximate, both prospectively (near future vs. distant future) and retrospectively (recent past vs. distant past), and in decisions that are psychologically proximate in terms of social or physical distance. In addition to clarifying the boundaries of the scope-insensitivity phenomenon, these findings help refine our understanding of the affective system of judgment. Specifically, the findings suggest that the affective system of judgment and decision making is not just a system of the present, it is more generally a system of the immediate self.

The sample size (both in terms of number of observations and population covered) of this study is considerably larger than the sample sizes of previous studies; a new and improved method of analyzing the lag structure of the relationship between drug launches and life-years lost is used; and a larger set of measures of the burden of cancer is analyzed. The number of DALYs and life-years lost are unrelated to drug launches 0–4 years earlier. This is not surprising, since utilization of a drug tends to be quite low during the first few post-launch years. Moreover, there is likely to be a lag of several years between utilization of a drug and its impact on mortality. However, mortality is significantly inversely related to the number of drug launches at least 5 years earlier, especially to drug launches 5–9 years earlier. One additional drug for a cancer site launched during 2006–2010 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs due to cancer at that site by 5.8%;; one additional drug launched during 1982–2005 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs by about 2.6%. Lower quality (or effectiveness) of earlier vintage drugs may account for their smaller estimated effect. We estimate that drugs launched during the entire 1982–2010 period reduced the number of cancer DALYs in 2015 by about 23.0%, and that, in the absence of new drug launches during 1982–2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs in 2015. Also, the nine countries with the largest number of drug launches during 1982–2010 are estimated to have had 14% fewer cancer DALYs (controlling for incidence) in 2015 than the nine countries with the smallest number of drug launches during 1982–2010. Estimates of the cost per life-year gained in 2015 from drugs launched during 2006–2010 range between $1,635 (life-years gained at all ages) and $2,820 (life-years gained before age 65). These estimates are similar to those obtained in previous country-specific studies of Belgium, Canada, and Mexico, and are well below the estimate obtained in one study of Switzerland. Mortality in 2015 is strongly inversely related to the number of drug launches in 2006–2010. If the relationship between mortality in 2020 and the number of drug launches in 2011–2015 is similar, drug launches 5–9 years earlier will reduce mortality even more (by 9.9%) between 2015 and 2020 than they did (by 8.4%) between 2010 and 2015.",Journal of Demographic Economics,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/impact-new-drug-launches-life-years-lost-2015-19-types-cancer-36-countries,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.03583566844714219,False,

One common way this occurs is when servers are hierarchical in their skills or in the level of service they can provide. Much of the literature studying such systems relies on an understanding of the relative costs and benefits associated with serving different customer types by the different levels of service. In this work, we focus on estimating these costs and benefits in a complex healthcare setting where the major differentiation among server types is the intensity of service provided. Step-down units (SDUs) were initially introduced in hospitals to provide an intermediate level of care for semicritically ill patients who are not sick enough to require intensive care but not stable enough to be treated in the general medical/surgical ward. One complicating factor is that the needs of customers is sometimes uncertain—specifically, it is difficult to know a priori which level of care a particular patient needs. Using data from 10 hospitals from a single hospital network, we take a data-driven approach to classify patients based on severity and empirically estimate the clinical and operational outcomes associated with routing these patients to the SDU. Our findings suggest that an SDU may be a cost-effective way to treat patients when used for patients who are post-ICU (intensive care unit). However, the impact of SDU care is more nuanced for patients admitted from the emergency department and may result in increased mortality risk and hospital length of stay for patients who should be treated in the ICU.

All of the measures of cancer mortality analyzed – the age-standardized mortality rate and the number of years of potential life lost before ages 75 and 65 are significantly inversely related to the number of new drugs that had been launched 6 or 7 years earlier. (As utilization of drugs is quite low during the first few years after launch, it is not surprising that mortality is not significantly related to the most recent drug launches.) New drugs launched during 1995–2004 are estimated to have reduced the age-standardized cancer mortality rate by 9.5% between 2001 and 2011, that is at an average annual rate of about 1.0%. New drugs launched during 1995–2004 accounted for almost all (94%) of the 2001–2011 reduction in the age-standardized mortality rate.

In many settings, the rise of online matching platforms has dramatically reduced the cost of finding and contacting potential partners. While one might expect both sides of the market to benefit from reduced search costs, this is far from guaranteed. In particular, this change may force participants to screen more potential partners before finding one who is willing to accept their offer. Thus, for a fixed screening cost, reductions in search and application costs may actually decrease aggregate welfare. We illustrate this fact using a model in which agents apply and screen asynchronously. In our model, it is possible that an agent on one side of the market (an ""employer"") identifies a suitable match on the other side (an ""applicant""), only to find that this applicant has already matched. We find that equilibrium is generically inefficient for both employers and applicants. Most notably, when application costs are sufficiently small, uncertainty about applicant availability may drive equilibrium employer welfare to zero. We consider a simple intervention available to the platform: limiting the visibility of applicants. We find that this intervention can significantly improve the welfare of agents on both sides of the market; applicants pay lower application costs, while employers are less likely to find that the applicants they screen have already matched.

Such patients tend to have higher mortality rates and longer lengths of stay than direct admits to the ICU. A new predictive model, the EDIP2, was developed with the intent to identify patients at risk for deterioration, which in some cases could trigger a proactive transfer to the ICU. While it is conceivable that proactive transfers could improve individual patient outcomes, they could also lead to ICU congestion. In this work, we utilize a retrospective dataset from 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals to estimate the potential benefit of proactive ICU transfers. In order to increase the robustness of our estimation results, we make a number of design choices to strengthen the instrumental variable and reduce model dependence. Using our empirical results to calibrate a simulation model, we find that proactively admitting the most severe patients could reduce mortality rates without increasing ICU congestion. However, being too aggressive with proactive transfers could degrade quality of care and, ultimately, patient outcomes. Thus, while we find evidence that proactive transfers could be effective, they would need to be used judiciously.",Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/examination-early-transfers-icu-based-physiologic-risk-score,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.01649097576616186,False,

Setting: Two academic tertiary care hospitals within the same health-care system. Patients: Adults admitted to the medical ICU at either the control or intervention hospital from October 2013 to March 2014 (preintervention) and October 2014 to March 2015 (postintervention). Interventions: Opening a 4-bed medical SDU at the intervention hospital on April 1, 2014. Measurements and Main Results: Using standard summary statistics, we compared patients across hospitals. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we quantified the association of opening an SDU and outcomes (hospital mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay [LOS], and time to transfer to the ICU) after adjustment for secular trends in patient case-mix and patient-level covariates which might impact outcome. We analyzed 500 (245 pre- and 255 postintervention) patients in the intervention hospital and 678 (323 pre- and 355 postintervention) in the control hospital. Patients at the control hospital were younger (60.5-60.6 vs 64.0-65.4 years, P < .001) with a higher severity of acute illness at the time of evaluation for ICU admission (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score: 4.9-4.0 vs 3.9-3.9, P < .001). Using the difference-in-differences methodology, we identified no association of hospital mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.81 [0.42 to 1.55], P = .52) or hospital LOS (% change [95% confidence interval]: −8.7% [−28.6% to 11.2%], P = .39) with admission to the intervention hospital after SDU opening.

Consequently, the investor has a first-order willingness to pay a portfolio manager who rebalances actively on his behalf. Moreover, the investor can diversify over time and his consumption aligns with predictions of mental accounting.

Building on theories of mental categorization, the authors argue that early (vs. late) introductions of distant brand extensions can be more beneficial for the brand. Three studies support this conclusion, demonstrating that early (vs. late) introductions of distant extensions can result in more positive final brand attitudes; that is, attitudes held after all the extensions have been introduced. This effect is driven by how easily the distant extension is integrated into consumers’ brand concepts and is moderated by overall brand positioning.

We use a simple model in which the bankruptcy code may result in deadweight losses, and may allow equity holders a share of residual value of the firm's assets in the bankruptcy proceedings. The paper predicts that, while value-maximising firms promise to hedge a higher fraction of the value of their FX exposure when the debt is issued, they may renege subsequently and take on some FX exposures at the expense of foreign creditors. To preclude this, strong and enforceable loan/bond covenants must be in place. Furthermore, the model predicts that FX exposure affects credit spreads, and that thin FX hedging markets lead to greater FX exposure, and a higher probability of default. The paper tests these theoretical predictions and shows that unhedged corporate FX exposures at the country level are indeed negatively associated with the strength of creditor rights and the depth of hedging markets. Using loan-specific data from the Reserve Bank of India, and exploiting recent changes in the bankruptcy law, the paper uncovers a clear connection between the creditor rights and the hedging behaviour of non-financial firms.",BIS Papers,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/fx-hedging-and-creditor-rights,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.0193378305161523,False,

These findings underscore that even with incentive alignment, preference measurement choice experiments such as choice-based conjoint analyses only represent an approximation of real-life choices. Although it is not feasible to systematically use questions with high Prob in the field, we predict and find that placing a higher probability question (such as an external validity task) at the beginning rather than the end of a questionnaire has a carryover effect on attention and information processing throughout the questionnaire, and it influences preference estimates as well.",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/attention-information-processing-and-choice-incentive-aligned-choice-experiments,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.006200995468206105,False,

This task is complicated by a lack of knowledge of all of the calendar time events that influence purchase timing. Yet, isolating calendar time variability from the natural ebb and flow of purchasing is important for accurately assessing the influence of calendar time shocks to the spending process, and for uncovering the customer-level purchasing patterns that robustly predict future spending. A comprehensive understanding of purchasing dynamics therefore requires a model that flexibly integrates known and unknown calendar time determinants of purchasing with individual-level predictors such as interpurchase time, customer lifetime, and number of past purchases. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric framework based on Gaussian process priors, which integrates these two sets of predictors by modeling both through latent functions that jointly determine purchase propensity. The estimates of these latent functions yield a visual representation of purchasing dynamics, which we call the model-based dashboard, that provides a nuanced decomposition of spending patterns. We show the utility of this framework through an application to purchasing in free-to-play mobile video games. Moreover, we show that in forecasting future spending, our model outperforms existing benchmarks.",Marketing Science,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/bayesian-nonparametric-customer-base-analysis-model-based-visualizations,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.02906269674033041,False,

We study this phenomenon in the context of both sponsored search advertising and display advertising. Ads are sold through auctions, and when exclusivity is allowed, the seller accepts two bids from advertisers, where one bid is for the standard display format in which multiple advertisers are displayed, and the other bid is for being shown exclusively (therefore they are called two-dimensional, or 2D, auctions). We identify two opposing forces at play in an auction that provides the exclusive placement option—allowing more flexible expression of preferences through bidding for exclusivity increases competition among advertisers, leading to higher bids, which increases the seller’s revenue (between-advertiser competition effect), but it also gives advertisers the incentive to shade their bids for their nonpreferred outcomes, which decreases the seller’s revenue (within-advertiser competition effect). Depending on which effect is stronger, the revenue may increase or decrease. We find that the 2D generalized second price (GSP2D) auction, which is an extension of the widely used generalized second price (GSP) auction and on which currently used auctions for exclusive placement are based, may lead to higher or lower revenue under different parametric conditions. Paradoxically, the revenue from allowing exclusive placement decreases as bidders have higher valuations for exclusive placement. We verify several key implications from our analysis of GSP2D using data from Bing for over 100,000 auctions. As a possible solution (applicable to both sponsored search and display advertising), we show that using VCG2D, which is the adaptation of the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction for the 2D setting, guarantees weakly higher revenue when exclusive display is allowed.

The SEUs of ethical and unethical behavioral options are proposed to be assessed intuitively during goal pursuit, with unethical conduct emerging when the expected benefits of moral transgressions outweigh the expected costs. A key insight of the model is that any factors that increase the value of a goal — including incentives, framings, and mindsets — can motivate misbehavior by increasing the SEU of unethical conduct. Although Moral Utility Theory emphasizes the automatic and habitual nature of most SEU appraisals, it also describes a mechanism for initiating the deliberative moral reasoning process: the experience of moral uncertainty. Moral uncertainty is proposed to occur when the SEUs of ethical and unethical behaviors are similar in magnitude, thereby activating the behavioral inhibition system and motivating the allocation of attentional resources toward the decision process. This framework bridges the gap between affective and cognitive perspectives on ethical decision making by identifying automatic evaluations as a central driver of moral decisions while also specifying when and how moral reasoning processes are initiated. By combining dual-process models of morality with well-validated principles from the science of motivation, Moral Utility Theory provides theoretical parsimony and formal modeling potential to the study of ethical decision making.

In this paper, we focus on understanding the design and implementation challenges of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions that are aimed at a more efficient sharing of aggregate risk between borrowers and lenders. Using a simple framework that builds on the mortgage design literature, we illustrate that ex ante–designed, automatically indexed mortgages and policies can facilitate a quick implementation of debt relief during a crisis. However, the welfare benefits of such solutions are substantially reduced if there are errors in understanding the underlying structure of income and housing risk and their relation to the indexes on which these solutions are based. Empirical evidence reveals significant spatial heterogeneity and the time-varying nature of the distribution of economic conditions, which pose a significant challenge to the effective ex ante design of such solutions. The design of ex post debt relief policies can be more easily fine-tuned to the specific realization of economic risk. However, the presence of various implementation frictions and their spatial heterogeneity can significantly hamper their effectiveness. Consequently, we argue that effective mortgage market design will likely involve a combination of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions, with state contingencies. We conclude by discussing the potential gains — which can be large, given significant regional heterogeneity — from tying mortgage terms and policies to local indicators, as well as mechanisms that may alleviate the adverse effects of ex post implementation frictions.",Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/mortgage-market-design-lessons-great-recession,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.044052407856592,False,debt distress; debt relief; debt restructuring

In the next section, we give an economic interpretation of meaningful work and emphasize how it is affected by the mission of the organization and the extent to which job design fulfills the three psychological needs at the basis of self-determination theory: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We point to the evidence that not everyone cares about having a meaningful job and discuss potential sources of this heterogeneity. We sketch a theoretical framework to start to formalize work as a source of meaning and think about how to incorporate this idea into agency theory and labor supply models. We discuss how workers' search for meaning may affect the design of monetary and nonmonetary incentives. We conclude by suggesting some insights and open questions for future research.",Journal of Economic Perspectives,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/nonmonetary-incentives-and-implications-work-source-meaning,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.02823045917896369,False,

This paper analyzes, given the sequential nature of reviews and the limited feedback of such past reviews, the information content they communicate to future customers. We consider a model with heterogeneous customers who buy a product of unknown quality and we focus on two different informational settings. In the first setting customers observe the whole history of past reviews. In the second one they only observe the sample mean of past reviews. We examine under which conditions, in each setting, customers can recover the true quality of the product based on the feedback they observe. In the case of total monitoring, if consumers adopt a fully rational Bayesian updating paradigm, then they asymptotically learn the unknown quality. With access to only the sample mean of past reviews, inference becomes intricate for customers and it is not clear if/when and how social learning can take place. We first analyze the setting when customers interpret the mean as the proxy of quality. We show that in the long run, the sample mean of reviews stabilizes and in general, they overestimate the underlying quality of the product in the long run. We establish properties of the bias, which stems from the selection associated with observing only reviews of customers who purchase. Then, we show the existence of a simple non-Bayesian quality inference rule that leads to social learning when all customers use such a rule. In this framework, when the population of consumers is mixed, we show that a subgroup of customers can learn the true quality and that this subgroup negatively affects the more naive customers.",Operations Research,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/information-distortions-online-ratings,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01764958337804119,False,

This is the case for many online-based services where customers have the choice to stop interacting with the firm either by formally terminating the relationship (e.g., canceling their account) or by simply ignoring all communications coming from the firm. The standard contractual versus noncontractual categorization of customer–firm relationships does not apply in such hybrid settings, which means the standard models for analyzing customer attrition do not apply. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to capture silent and overt churn. We apply our modeling framework to two different contexts — a daily deal website and a performing arts organization. In contrast to previous studies that have not separated the two types of churn, we find that overt churners in these hybrid settings tend to interact more, rather than less, with the firm prior to churning; that is, in settings where both types of churn are present, a high level of activity — such as customers actively opening emails received from the firm — is not necessarily a good indicator of future engagement; rather it is associated with higher risk of overt churn. We also identify a large number of ""silent churners"" in both empirical applications — customers who disengage with the company very early on, rarely exhibit any type of activity, and almost never churn overtly. Furthermore, we show how the two types of churners respond very differently to the firm's communications, implying that a common retention strategy for proactive churn management is not appropriate in these hybrid settings.",Marketing Science,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/some-customers-would-rather-leave-without-saying-goodbye,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.005866784935710462,False,

This model examines the relation between individuals' position of advantage or disadvantage in a social hierarchy and their propensity toward agency and communion. We begin by identifying and reviewing four inequalities — Resources, Opportunities, Appraisals, and Deference, or the ROAD of inequality — that are fundamental to social advantage and disadvantage. We explain how these inequalities can instill a sense of advantage and disadvantage in individuals. Next, we discuss two core drivers of human behavior: agency and communion. We integrate these literatures to introduce the model's central propositions: a sense of advantage orients individuals toward agency and a sense of disadvantage orients individuals toward communion. We review evidence for this model across four distinct social hierarchies: power, social class, gender, and race. A number of findings suggest that higher-power individuals, higher-class individuals, men, and Whites express greater agency, whereas lower-power individuals, lower-class individuals, women, and minorities express greater communion. We also consider results in the literature that appear inconsistent with our propositions (i.e., when the advantaged are communal and the disadvantaged are agentic) and offer theoretical integrations to resolve these apparent contradictions. In particular, we highlight how the orthogonal nature of agency and communion can produce behavior that results from the combination of high agency and communion. To help motivate a future research agenda, we note the importance of both hierarchy salience and cultural considerations in determining individuals' orientations toward agency and communion.

ExpectedRCL performs substantially better than net charge-offs, realized credit losses, and fair value of loans in predicting credit losses, and reflects all the explanatory power of the credit loss-related information in these variables. It may therefore serve as a benchmark for estimating the profitability of a loan yield when evaluating bank performance and value creation. Although banks have been disclosing fair value estimates for their loan portfolios since 1992, these estimates appear to perform relatively poorly in capturing expected credit losses. Investors also appear to not fully incorporate the expected credit losses in pricing bank stocks, as ExpectedRCL is negatively and significantly related to subsequent stock returns. ExpectedRCL also contains incremental information about future credit losses relative to the allowance and provision for loan and lease losses (ALLL and PLLL, respectively).

In five studies, we draw upon social role and backlash theories to show that women imbue delegation with more agentic traits, have more negative associations with delegating, and feel greater guilt about delegating than men. These associations result in women delegating less than men and, when they do delegate, having lower-quality interactions with subordinates. We further show that reframing delegation as communal attenuates women's negative associations with delegation. These findings reveal that even when a given behavior has both agentic and communal elements, perceptions of agency can undermine women's engagement in them. However, emphasizing the communal nature of seemingly agentic acts may encourage women's engagement in such critical leadership behaviors. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for research on gender differences and leadership behavior in the workplace.",Academy of Management Journal,2018,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/delegate-or-not-delegate-gender-differences-affective-associations-and-behavioral,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.1190628511326771,True,gender bias; gender-focused policies; gender-sensitive policies; leadership for women; women in politics; women's leadership; women's representation

We suggest that combining the grit scale — which only captures perseverance — with a measure that assesses whether individuals attain desired levels of passion will predict performance. We first metaanalyzed 127 studies (n = 45,485) that used the grit scale and assessed performance, and found that effect sizes are larger in studies where participants were more passionate for the performance domain. Second, in a survey of employees matched to supervisor-rated job performance (n = 422), we found that the combination of perseverance, measured through the grit scale, and passion attainment, measured through a new scale, predicted higher performance. A final study measured perseverance and passion attainment in a sample of students (n = 248) and linked these to their grade-point average (GPA), finding that the combination of perseverance and passion attainment predicted higher GPAs in part through increased immersion. The present results help resolve the mixed evidence of grit's relationship with performance by highlighting the important role that passion plays in predicting performance.

Because SDUs are less richly staffed than ICUs, they are less costly to operate; however, they also are unable to provide the level of care required by the sickest patients. There is an ongoing debate in the medical community as to whether and how SDUs should be used. On one hand, an SDU alleviates ICU congestion by providing a safe environment for post-ICU patients before they are stable enough to be transferred to the general wards. On the other hand, an SDU can take capacity away from the already over-congested ICU. In this work, we propose a queueing model of patient flow through the ICU and SDU in order to determine when an SDU is needed, what size it should be, and what are the main drivers influencing these decisions. Using first- and second-order analysis, we examine the tradeoff between reserving capacity in the ICU for the most critical patients and gaining additional capacity achieved by allocating nurses to the SDU due to the lower staffing requirement. We find that under some circumstances the optimal size of the SDU is zero, while in other cases, having a sizable SDU may be beneficial. Moreover, we identify two parameters which play a prominent role in the SDU sizing decision: p, which captures the demand for SDU beds, and ν, which captures the supply gains by moving nurses to the SDU. The insights from our work provide rigorous justification for the variation in SDU use seen in practice as well as highlight which factors should be considered when making such sizing decisions for critical care.",Production and Operations Management,2017,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/critical-care-capacity-management-understanding-role-step-down-unit,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.008880229500227975,False,

However, the psychological processes underlying decisions involving outcomes at different points in time remain unclear, limiting opportunities to intervene and improve people’s patience. This research examines information-search strategies used during intertemporal choice and their impact on decisions. In experiment 1, we demonstrate that search strategies vary substantially across individuals. We subsequently identify two distinct search strategies across individuals. Comparative searchers, who compare features across options, discount future options less and are more susceptible to acceleration versus delay framing than integrative searchers, who integrate the features of an option. Experiment 2 manipulates search using an unobtrusive method to establish a causal relationship between strategy and choice, randomly assigning participants to conditions promoting either comparative or integrative search. Again, comparative search promotes greater patience than integrative search. Additionally, when participants adopt a comparative search strategy, they also exhibit greater effects of acceleration versus delay framing. Although most participants reported that the manipulation did not change their behavior, promoting comparative search decreased discounting of future rewards substantially and speeded patient choices. These findings highlight the central role that heterogeneity in psychological processes plays in shaping intertemporal choice. Importantly, these results indicate that theories that ignore variability in search strategies may be inadvertently aggregating over different subpopulations that use very different processes.

Multiplicative-innovation synergies arise from combining greater proportions of diverse technologies and their effects have longer duration. The most-effective organizational-learning processes accompanying exposure to exotic technology streams via technological acquisition will occur if firms have properly invested in adaptive capacity to synthesize inventions using the unfamiliar knowledge. In the first tests of innovation synergies on firm performance, we find that technological novelty in patent content improves return on assets for firms that consistently invested in R&D. Using patent-content scores to characterize whether inventors have integrated greater proportions of exotic technological antecedents into their inventions (or not), we test the impact of innovation synergies on firms’ performance after technological acquisitions.

These phases of outside media ownership correspond to the stages of economic development in that country.The article finds that in rich countries, the ownership of media by industrial companies as a way to create political influence has been declining. The second phase, based on economic synergies, has become a less significant driver, too. On the other hand, there has been a significant growth of cross-ownership through financial intermediaries. In contrast, the media systems of emerging and developing countries are still operating in the first two phases of cross-ownership, centered on projection of influence and on conglomerate business synergies.It is quite likely that these dynamics will lead to a “capture gap” between emerging and rich societies. Media in the former would be significantly more captured through the seekers of personal influence and conglomerate synergies, while media in the latter are subject to professional investors imperatives of profitability, growth, predictability, and fit into portfolio diversification. The same financial institutions from rich countries are also likely to seek acquisitions in the emerging markets by leapfrogging the two other stages. The likely responses are restrictions on foreign ownership of media. Domestic conglomerates will step in and assume control.

In this paper we investigate the social effects of CRM campaigns. We demonstrate that, in business settings that are characterized by network externalities, a CRM campaign that is aimed at changing the behavior of specific customers propagates through the social network, thereby also affecting the behavior of non-targeted customers. Using a randomized field experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile telecommunications provider, we find that the social connections of targeted customers increase their consumption and are less likely to churn due to a campaign that was neither targeted at them nor offered them any direct incentives. We estimate a social multiplier of 1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign on first-degree connections of targeted customers is 28% of the effect of the campaign on the targeted customers. By further leveraging the randomized experimental design we show that, consistent with a network externality account, the increase in activity among the non-targeted but connected customers is driven by the increase in communication between the targeted customers and their connections, making the local network of the non-targeted customers more valuable. Our findings suggest that in targeting CRM marketing campaigns, firms should consider not only the profitability of the targeted customer, but also the potential spillover of the campaign to non-targeted but connected customers.",Journal of Marketing Research,2017,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/beyond-target-customer-social-effects-crm-campaigns,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01731365198617454,False,

In addition, Rothstein presents new evidence that he argues raises concerns about three aspects of CFR's methods and identi cation assumptions: their treatment of missing data, the validity of their quasi-experimental design, and their method of controlling for observables when estimating teachers' long-term effects. In this paper, we show that Rothstein's methodological critiques are not valid by replicating his new empirical ndings using simulated data in which none of CFR's identi cation assumptions are violated. We also present supplementary empirical evidence from our data supporting the assumptions required for CFR's original analyses. Together, these results show that: (1) Rothstein's technique for imputing teacher VA for teachers with missing data generates bias, while subsamples with no missing data yield estimates of forecast bias similar to CFR's baseline results; (2) his proposed prior score ""placebo test"" rejects valid quasi-experimental research designs, and the correlation between changes in prior test scores and current teacher value-added he documents is an artifact of estimating teacher value-added using prior test score data; and (3) his method of controlling for covariates yields inconsistent estimates of teachers' long-term effects, while quasi-experimental designs that do not rely on controls for observables yield estimates of teachers' long-term impacts similar to CFR's baseline results.

First, loss aversion explains excess smoothness and sensitivity — that is, the empirical observation that consumption responds to income shocks with a lag. Intuitively, such lagged responses allow the agent to delay painful losses in consumption until his expectations have adjusted. Secondly, the preferences generate a hump-shaped consumption profile. Early in life, consumption is low due to a first-order precautionary-savings motive. However, as uncertainty resolves over time, this motive is dominated by time-inconsistent overconsumption that eventually leads to declining consumption towards the end of life. Thirdly, consumption drops at retirement. Prior to retirement, the agent wants to overconsume his uncertain income before his expectations catch up. Post-retirement, however, income is no longer uncertain, and overconsumption is associated with a sure loss in future consumption. As an empirical contribution, I structurally estimate the preference parameters using life-cycle consumption data.

To understand how the search for partners should be designed, we consider a dynamic model of search by strategic agents with costly discovery of pair-specific match value. We find that in many settings, the platform can mitigate wasteful competition in partner search via restricting what agents can see/do. Surprisingly, simple restrictions can improve social welfare even when screening costs are small, and agents on each side are ex-ante homogeneous. In asymmetric markets where agents on one side have a tendency to be more selective (due to smaller screening costs or greater market power), the platform should force the more selective side of the market to reach out first, by explicitly disallowing the less selective side from doing so. This allows the agents on the less selective side to exercise more choice in equilibrium. When agents are vertically differentiated, forcing one side of the market to propose results in a significant increase in welfare even in the limit of vanishing screening costs. Furthermore, a Pareto improvement in welfare is possible in this limit; the weakest agents can be helped without hurting other agents.

Given that lay observers are prone to cognitive biases, such as the halo effect, the validity of theories that are exclusively based on observed behaviors is questionable. We thus follow the call of leading scientists in the field and derive a parsimonious model of leadership behavior that is informed by established psychological theories. Building on the taxonomy of Yukl (2012), we propose three task-oriented behavior categories (enhancing understanding, strengthening motivation and facilitating implementation) and three relation-oriented behavior categories (fostering coordination, promoting cooperation and activating resources), each of which is further specified by a number of distinct behaviors. While the task-oriented behaviors are directed towards the accomplishment of shared objectives, the relation-oriented behaviors support this process by increasing the coordinated engagement of the team members.

Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect in a between-subjects field experiment of a toy on smaller-sized meal choice (here, a binary choice between a smaller-sized or regular-sized meal bundles). A random sample of 109 elementary school children from two schools in the Tucson, Arizona metropolitan area (55 females; Mage = 8.53 years, SDage = 2.14; MBMI = 18.30, SDBMI = 4.42) participated.

These results converge on the possibility that men, relative to women, are less inclined to be concerned with keeping track of their partners' outstanding needs, perhaps because doing so is a behavior that is less strongly prescribed for men than for women.

Indeed, Dodd-Frank and other post-crisis regulatory reforms have failed to address the major shortcomings that produced the crisis of 2007–2009. Most importantly, excessive housing finance risk was not dealt with adequately, and is already on the rise again. And prudential standards for banks, while much stricter, remain unreliable in a severe economic downturn. After providing evidence of the shortcomings of major parts of the regulatory structure created after 2008, the author points to fundamental problems in the thinking underlying the post-crisis regulatory changes that made those reforms unlikely to succeed. Moreover, he argues that the new processes of financial regulation have fostered many abuses of the rule of law, which have politicized regulation, adding to its cost and discrediting important supervisory and regulatory agencies. The author suggests that simpler, more effective, less costly, and more respectable approaches to regulation are possible.

Our main result is that these conclusions are not robust to the introduction of lack of commitment. Under lack of commitment, large and tilted debt positions are very expensive to finance ex ante since they exacerbate the problem of lack of commitment ex post. In contrast, a flat maturity structure minimizes the cost of lack of commitment, though it also limits insurance and increases the volatility of fiscal policy distortions. We show that the optimal time-consistent maturity structure is nearly flat because reducing average borrowing costs is quantitatively more important for welfare than reducing fiscal policy volatility. Thus, under lack of commitment, the government actively manages its debt positions and can approximate optimal policy by confining its debt instruments to consols.",The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2017,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/optimal-time-consistent-government-debt-maturity,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.03452851691672032,False,debt restructuring; long-term debt sustainability

Next, we consider a decentralized channel with a wholesale price contract, in which a manufacturer determines quality and wholesale price, while a retailer determines inventory and retail price. We find that, different from the case without endogenous inventory, product quality can be higher in a decentralized channel compared to a centralized channel, and this is because a wholesale price contract shields the manufacturer from inventory risk. For both centralized and decentralized channels, we find that as demand uncertainty increases, quality decreases, while, different from the case without endogenous quality, inventory can be U-shaped. Interestingly, to mitigate the impact of demand uncertainty on profit, quality can be a more effective lever than inventory in a centralized channel; however, in a decentralized channel, quality is less responsive and inventory is more responsive to demand uncertainty than in a centralized channel.",Marketing Science,2017,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/product-quality-distribution-channel-inventory-risk,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.009250464910928749,False,

Persuasive appeals that were matched to people's extraversion or openness-to-experience level resulted in up to 40% more clicks and up to 50% more purchases than their mismatching or unpersonalized counterparts.

Because humans constantly experience and react to ambient temperature, we propose that temperature is a crucial environmental factor that is associated with individuals' habitual behavioural patterns and, therefore, with fundamental dimensions of personality. To test the relationship between ambient temperature and personality, we conducted two large-scale studies in two geographically large yet culturally distinct countries: China and the United States. Using data from 59 Chinese cities (N = 5,587), multilevel analyses and machine learning analyses revealed that compared with individuals who grew up in regions with less clement temperatures, individuals who grew up in regions with more clement temperatures (that is, closer to 22 ℃) scored higher on personality factors related to socialization and stability (agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability) and personal growth and plasticity (extraversion and openness to experience). These relationships between temperature clemency and personality factors were replicated in a larger dataset of 12,499 ZIP-code level locations (the lowest geographical level feasible) in the United States (N = 1,660,638).

We then examined whether the audience-tuning memory bias might emerge when the out-group audienceâ€™s epistemic authority is enhanced, either by increasing epistemic expertise concerning the communication topic or by creating epistemic consensus among members of a multiperson out-group audience.

Next, we draw on status based theories of competition, in particular mid-status conformity theory, to explain the coexistence of sustained advantage and sustainable disadvantage in the performance distribution of firms. In our theorizing, we distinguish between three performance levels corresponding to above, around, and below the norm which we label sustainable superiority, sustainable normalcy, and sustainable inferiority. Our thesis is that a performance distribution with these features reflects a reinforcing homology between social status stratification and economic performance stratification that obtains in equilibrium.

Integrating theoretical perspectives from psychology, economics, and organizational theory, we explore this control-motivation dilemma inherent in contracts and present the Contract-Autonomy-Motivation-Performance-Structure (CAMPS) model, which highlights the synergistic benefits of combining structure and autonomy. The model proposes that subtle reductions in the specificity of a contract's language can boost autonomy, which increases intrinsic motivation and improves a range of desirable behaviors. Nine field and laboratory experiments found that less specific contracts increased task persistence, creativity, and cooperation, both immediately and longitudinally, because they boosted autonomy and intrinsic motivation. These positive effects, however, only occurred when contracts provided sufficient structure. Furthermore, the effects were limited to control-oriented clauses (i.e., legal clauses), and did not extend to coordination-oriented clauses (i.e., technical clauses). That is, there were synergistic benefits when a contract served as a scaffold that combined structure with general clauses. Overall, the current model and experiments identify a low-cost solution to the common problem of regulating social relationships: finding the right amount of contract specificity promotes desirable outcomes, including behaviors that are notoriously difficult to contract.

Results revealed that under both threat and challenge stress evaluations, a stress-is-enhancing mindset produced sharper increases in anabolic (growth) hormones relative to a stress-is-debilitating mindset. Furthermore, when the stress was evaluated as a challenge, a stress-is-enhancing mindset produced sharper increases in positive affect, heightened attentional bias towards positive stimuli, and greater cognitive flexibility, whereas a stress-is-debilitating mindset produced worse cognitive and affective outcomes.

Hehman, , C.A.M. Sutherland, , J.K. Flake, , and Michael Slepian, Michael Slepian","Models of person perception have long asserted that our impressions of others are guided by characteristics of both the target and perceiver. However, research has not yet quantified to what extent perceivers and targets contribute to different impressions. This quantification is theoretically critical, as it addresses how much an impression arises from ""our minds"" versus ""others' faces."" Here, we apply cross-classified random effects models to address this fundamental question in social cognition, using approximately 700,000 ratings of faces. With this approach, we demonstrate that (a) different trait impressions have unique causal processes, meaning that some impressions are largely informed by perceiver-level characteristics whereas others are driven more by physical target-level characteristics; (b) modeling of perceiver- and target-variance in impressions informs fundamental models of social perception; (c) Perceiver × Target interactions explain a substantial portion of variance in impressions; (d) greater emotional intensity in stimuli decreases the influence of the perceiver; and (e) more variable, naturalistic stimuli increases variation across perceivers. Important overarching patterns emerged. Broadly, traits and dimensions representing inferences of character (e.g., dominance) are driven more by perceiver characteristics than those representing appearance-based appraisals (e.g., youthful-attractiveness). Moreover, inferences made of more ambiguous traits (e.g., creative) or displays (e.g., faces with less extreme emotions, less-controlled stimuli) are similarly driven more by perceiver than target characteristics. Together, results highlight the large role that perceiver and target variability play in trait impressions, and develop a new topography of trait impressions that considers the source of the impression.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2017,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/unique-contributions-perceiver-and-target-characteristics-person-perception,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.01288123681412695,False,

Then, the Gaussian copula (a numerical algorithm to generate vectors according to a prespecified probabilistic characterization) is used in combination with the MRG condition to generate a set of plausible cash flow vectors. These vectors form the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation that offers two important advantages: it is easy to implement and it makes no restrictive assumptions regarding the evolution of the cash flows over time. Thus, one can estimate the distribution of a broad set of metrics (net present value, internal rate of return, payback periods, etc.). Additionally, the method does not have any of the typical limitations of real options–based approaches, namely, cash flows that follow a Brownian motion or some specific diffusion process or whose volatility needs to be constant.

The current research investigates the reverse possibility: Can social perceptions influence facial appearance? We examine a social tag that is associated with us early in life — our given name. The hypothesis is that name stereotypes can be manifested in facial appearance, producing a face-name matching effect, whereby both a social perceiver and a computer are able to accurately match a person's name to his or her face. In 8 studies we demonstrate the existence of this effect, as participants examining an unfamiliar face accurately select the person's true name from a list of several names, significantly above chance level. We replicate the effect in 2 countries and find that it extends beyond the limits of socioeconomic cues. We also find the effect using a computer-based paradigm and 94,000 faces. In our exploration of the underlying mechanism, we show that existing name stereotypes produce the effect, as its occurrence is culture-dependent. A self-fulfilling prophecy seems to be at work, as initial evidence shows that facial appearance regions that are controlled by the individual (e.g., hairstyle) are sufficient to produce the effect, and socially using one's given name is necessary to generate the effect. Together, these studies suggest that facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look.

CCOT staffing is variable across hospitals and optimal team composition is unknown. Objectives To assess whether adding a critical care medicine trained physician assistant (CCM-PA) to a critical care outreach team (CCOT) impacts clinical and process outcomes. Methods We performed a retrospective study of two cohorts—one with a CCM-PA added to the CCOT (intervention hospital) and one with no staffing change (control hospital)—at two facilities in the same system. All adults in the emergency department and hospital for whom CCOT consultation was requested from October 1, 2012-March 16, 2013 (pre-intervention) and January 5-March 31, 2014 (post-intervention) were included. We performed difference-in-differences analyses comparing pre- to post-intervention periods in the intervention versus control hospitals to assess the impact of adding the CCM-PA to the CCOT. Measurements and Main Results Our cohort consisted of 3,099 patients (control hospital: 792 pre- and 595 post-intervention; intervention hospital: 1114 pre- and 839 post-intervention). Intervention hospital patients tended to be younger, with fewer comorbidities, but with similar severity of acute illness. Across both periods, hospital mortality (p = 0.26) and hospital length of stay (p = 0.64) for the intervention vs control hospitals were similar, but time-to-transfer to the ICU was longer for the intervention hospital (13.3–17.0 vs 11.5–11.6 hours, p = 0.006). Using the difference-in-differences approach, we found a 19.2% reduction (95 confidence interval: 6.7%-31.6%, p = 0.002) in the time-to-transfer to the ICU associated with adding the CCM-PA to the CCOT; we found no difference in hospital mortality (p = 0.20) or length of stay (p = 0.52).

Because solving for the optimal scheduling policy is computationally intractable, we focus our attention on the performance of three intuitive heuristics: (1) a policy which maximizes the expected immediate reward, (2) a policy which maximizes the expected immediate reward rate, and (3) a policy which prioritizes jobs with imminent deadlines. We provide performance guarantees for all three policies and show that many of these performance bounds are tight.

I analyze the effect that pharmaceutical innovation had on premature cancer mortality in Switzerland during the period 1995-2012 by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in premature mortality, controlling for the number of people diagnosed and mean age at diagnosis. Premature cancer mortality before ages 75 and 65 is significantly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs registered 5, 10, and 15 years earlier. The number of drugs registered during 1980-1997 explains 63 % of the variation across cancer sites in the 1995-2012 log change in the premature (before age 75) mortality rate. Controlling for the cumulative number of drugs, the cumulative number of chemical subgroups does not have a statistically significant effect on premature mortality. This suggests that drugs (chemical substances) within the same class (chemical sub-group) are not ""therapeutically equivalent"". Over 17,000 life-years before age 75 were gained in 2012 due to drugs registered during 1990-2007. The number of life-years before age 75 gained in 2012 from drugs registered during two earlier periods (1985-2002 and 1980-1997) were more than twice as great. Since mean utilization of new drugs is much lower than mean utilization of older drugs, more recent dmg registrations may have a smaller effect on premature mortality than earlier dmg registrations even if the average quality of newer drugs is higher. Estimates of the cost per life-year gained before ages 75 and 65 in 2012 from drags registered during 1990-2007 are $21,228 and $28,673, respectively.

The estimates indicate that the cost per life-year before age 75 gained from drags registered during earlier periods (1985-2002 and 1980-1997) were considerably lower: $5299 and $3218, respectively. The largest reductions in premature mortality occur at least a decade after drags are registered, when their utilization increases significantly.

The self-as-object is primarily concerned with thinking about oneself in valued ways, whereas the self-as-subject is primarily concerned with behavioral self-regulation. Using two prominent self-theories (self-affirmation, a self-as-object framework) and ego depletion theory (a self-as-subject perspective), we first show how results across disparate literatures in organizational behavior may be accounted for by common underlying mechanisms, and the advances that emerge from recognizing this convergence. We then consider a variety of ways in which insights into organizational behavior may be gleaned from examining the self-as-object and self-as-subject conjointly. Processes associated with the self-as-object and self-as-subject combine interactively to influence employees' attitudes and behavior, and they also influence one another. Furthermore, considering the two self-processes in tandem shows how: (1) effects that appear to be similar differ meaningfully in the mechanisms accounting for them, and (2) seemingly discrepant results may be reconciled. Our analysis demonstrates that the two self-processes have implications for many literatures in organizational behavior including motivation, organizational change, ethics, justice, escalation of commitment, social identity, control, and power.

I analyze the effect that pharmaceutical innovation had on cancer mortality in Belgium, by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger subsequent declines in mortality, controlling for changes in cancer incidence. The measures of mortality analyzed – premature (before ages 75 and 65) mortality rates and mean age at death – are not subject to lead-time bias. Premature cancer mortality rates are significantly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs registered 15–23 years earlier. Since mean utilization of drugs that have been marketed for less than 10 years is less than one fourth as great as mean utilization of drugs that have been marketed for at least a decade, it is not surprising that premature mortality is strongly inversely related only to the cumulative number of drugs that had been registered at least 10 years earlier. Drugs registered during the period 1987–1995 are estimated to have reduced the premature cancer mortality rate in 2012 by 20%. Mean age at death from cancer increased by 1.17 years between 2004 and 2012. The estimates indicate that drugs registered during the period 1987–1995 increased mean age at death from cancer in 2012 by 1.52 years. The estimates also suggest that drugs (chemical substances) within the same class (chemical subgroup) are not “therapeutically equivalent,” i.e. they do not have essentially the same effect in the treatment of a disease or condition. The estimates imply that the drugs registered during 1987–1995 reduced the number of life-years lost to cancer at all ages in 2012 by 41,207. The estimated cost per-life-year gained in 2012 from cancer drugs registered in Belgium during the period 1987–1995 was €1311. This estimate is well below even the lowest estimates from other studies of the value of a life-year saved. The largest reductions in premature mortality occur 15–23 years after drugs are registered, when their utilization increases significantly. This suggests that, if Belgium is to obtain substantial additional reductions in premature cancer mortality in the future (15 or more years from now) at a modest cost, pharmaceutical innovation (registration of new drugs) is needed today.",Forum for Health Economics and Policy,2016,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/impact-pharmaceutical-innovation-cancer-mortality-belgium-2004-2012,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.04707069887272073,False,premature mortality

The vast majority of these queueing models ignore the effects of delay experienced by a patient awaiting care. However, long delays may have adverse effects on patient outcomes and can potentially lead to longer lengths of stay (LOS) when the patient ultimately does receive care. This work sets out to understand these delay issues from an operational perspective. Using data of over 57,000 Emergency Department (ED) visits, we use an instrumental variable approach to empirically measure the impact of delays in ICU admission, i.e. ED boarding, on the patient’s ICU LOS for multiple patient types. Capturing these empirically observed effects in a queueing model is challenging as the effect introduces potentially long range correlations in service and inter-arrival times. We propose a queueing model which incorporates these measured delay effects and characterize approximations to the expected work in the system when the service time of a job is adversely impacted by the delay experienced by that job. Our approximation demonstrates an effect of system load on work which grows much faster than the traditional 1/(1 − ρ) relationship seen in most queueing systems. As such, it is imperative that the relationship of delays on LOS be better understood by hospital managers so that they can make capacity decisions that prevent even seemingly moderate delays from causing dire operational consequences.",Management Science,2016,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/impact-delays-service-times-intensive-care-unit,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.01123986492860951,False,

Available service resources are dynamically configured and allocated to the queues to process the tasks. At each point in time, a scheduler chooses a service configuration across the queues, in response to queue backlogs. Switching from one service configuration to another incurs a setup time, during which idling occurs and service bandwidth is lost. Such setup times are inherent in manufacturing and computer systems. Frequent switchings can significantly compromise the service capacity of such systems. A maximum weight matching (MWM) scheduler, which is known to maximize throughput in the absence of setups, can easily become unstable with setups, even under low load.

Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected pro-competitive effects. However, the price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of the input tariff liberalization. The reason for this incomplete cost pass-through to prices is that firms offset their reductions in marginal costs by raising markups.

In many formal and informal results, firm profitability depends on whether the firm can identify buyer segments in which it has the largest value gap—namely, a value-gap advantage. These results typically assume, either explicitly or implicitly, that firms have constant marginal costs. In this paper, we show that if a firm’s value gap is defined as its marginal value creation with a buyer, value gaps provide a foundation for a firm’s profitability more generally. By allowing for nonconstant marginal costs, two important factors emerge. First, a firm’s value-gap advantage with respect to a buyer should be based on comparing the firm’s marginal value creation with the buyer’s best alternative for value capture, not value creation. Second, a firm’s guaranteed profitability depends critically on buyer competition. We show that in addition to excluded buyers, there are two other sources of buyer competition. A competitor’s buyer acts like an excluded buyer of a given firm if it can create more value with the given firm. We call such buyers envious buyers. Additionally, because of linkages in buyer preferences—which we call market-price effects—a firm may benefit from a competitor’s excluded or envious buyer. Consequently, a firm can benefit from demand for seemingly unrelated products, even when that demand includes buyers who have zero willingness-to-pay for the firm’s product. These additional sources of buyer competition explain how, in environments of excess supply, a firm can still be guaranteed profits due to competition.",Strategy Science,2016,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/value-gaps-and-profitability,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.0203532467428937,False,

In the post-crisis period, bankers were thus more supportive of the market stabilization strategy of assisting small banks. In contrast, the experience of organizing mutual lending, a course of collective action that highlighted the power of businesses independent of the communities in which they were located, led bankers to focus more on their sectional interest and favor the market stabilization strategy of eliminating small banks.

The decline in reservation wages is driven primarily by older individuals and those with personal savings at the start of the survey.

Job offers are more likely to be accepted if the offered wage exceeds the reservation wage, and the reservation wage has more predictive power in this regard than the pre-displacement wage, suggesting the reservation wage contains useful information about workers' future decisions. In addition, there is a discrete rise in job acceptance when the offered wage exceeds the reservation wage.

In this paper, we build a theoretical model of unorganized and organized retailing in emerging economies by carefully modeling key characteristics of the retailing environment, the retailers, the consumers, and product categories. The primary insight that we obtain is that in a competitive market comprising of only unorganized retailers, the advent of organized retailing injects efficiency into the market leading to a reduction in the number of unorganized retailers. This, in turn, makes the market less competitive. Building on this basic insight, we obtain a number of counterintuitive results. For instance, (i) the presence of organized retailing may increase the prices charged by unorganized retailers; (ii) as the consumers’ transportation cost to the unorganized retailers increases, the market share of the unorganized retailing sector may increase; (iii) as the probability of bulk consumption increases and consumers prefer to purchase more from the organized retailer, prices and profits at the organized retailer may decrease; and (iv) the presence of organized retailing can lead to both consumer and social surplus being lower because consumers face higher prices at unorganized retailers and there is wastage in the economy due to bulk purchasing at organized retailers. Our model offers an explanation for certain surprising empirical observations related to retailing in emerging markets, such as why in the last few years in the Indian market the unorganized retailers who have survived the advent of organized retailing seem to be doing better.

In this paper, we use a stylized theoretical model to answer a key question that e-tailers are facing: When should they use an agency selling format instead of using the more conventional reselling format? We find that agency selling is more efficient than reselling and leads to lower retail prices; however, the e-tailers end up giving control over retail prices to the manufacturer. Therefore, the reaction by the manufacturer, who makes electronic channel pricing decisions based on their impact on demand in the traditional channel (brick-and-mortar retailing), is an important factor for e-tailers to consider. We find that when sales in the electronic channel lead to a negative effect on demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer agency selling, whereas when sales in the electronic channel lead to substantial stimulation of demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer reselling. This preference is mediated by competition between e-tailers—as competition between them increases, e-tailers prefer to use agency selling. We also find that when e-tailers benefit from positive externalities from the sales of the focal product (such as additional profits from sales of associated products), retail prices may be lower under reselling than under agency selling, and the e-tailers prefer reselling under some conditions for which they would prefer agency selling without the positive externalities.",Management Science,2016,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/agency-selling-or-reselling-channel-structures-electronic-retailing,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.007278857476597584,False,

Design: Retrospective study using an instrumental variable to remove biases from unobserved differences in illness severity for patients admitted to ICU. Setting: Fifteen hospitals in an integrated healthcare delivery system in California. Patients: Seventy thousand one hundred thirty-three episodes involving patients admitted via emergency departments to a medical service over a 1-year period between 2008 and 2009. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: A third of patients admitted via emergency department to a medical service were admitted under high ICU congestion (more than 90% of beds occupied). High ICU congestion was associated with a 9% lower likelihood of ICU admission for patients defined as eligible for ICU admission. We further found strong associations between ICU admission and patient outcomes, with a 32% lower likelihood of hospital readmission if the first inpatient unit was an ICU. Similarly, hospital length of stay decreased by 33% and likelihood of transfer to ICU from other units — including ICU readmission if the first unit was an ICU — decreased by 73%. Conclusions: High ICU congestion is associated with a lower likelihood of ICU admission, which has important operational implications and can affect patient outcomes. By taking advantage of our ability to identify a subset of patients whose ICU admission decisions are affected by congestion, we found that, if congestion were not a barrier and more eligible patients were admitted to ICU, this hospital system could save approximately 7.5 hospital readmissions and 253.8 hospital days per year.

The main findings are: (i) covariate balance, as measured by differences in means, variance ratios, KolmogorovÃ¢â?¬â€œSmirnov distances, and cross-match test statistics, is better with cardinality matching because by construction it satisfies balance requirements; (ii) for given levels of covariate balance, the matched samples are larger with cardinality matching than with the other methods; (iii) in terms of covariate distances, optimal subset matching performs best; (iv) treatment effect estimates from cardinality matching have lower root-mean-square errors, provided strong requirements for balance, specifically, fine balance, or strength-<em>k</em> balance, plus close mean balance. In standard practice, a matched sample is considered to be balanced if the absolute differences in means of the covariates across treatment groups are smaller than 0.1 standard deviations. However, the simulation results suggest that stronger forms of balance should be pursued in order to remove systematic biases due to observed covariates when a difference in means treatment effect estimator is used.

To capture liquidity costs at default, margin requirements need to increase superlinearly in position size. However, convex margin requirements create an incentive for a swaps dealer to split its positions across multiple CCPs, effectively “hiding” potential liquidation costs from each CCP. To compensate, each CCP needs to set higher margin requirements than it would in isolation. In a model with two CCPs, we define an equilibrium as a pair of margin schedules through which both CCPs collect sufficient margin under a dealer’s optimal allocation of trades. In the case of linear price impact, we show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an equilibrium is that the two CCPs agree on liquidity costs, and we characterize all equilibria when this holds.

We show that because of demand censoring in the presence of limited inventory (i.e., demand realizations higher than the inventory level are unobservable), a quota-bonus contract is the optimal equilibrium contract, and it exists, even for a demand distribution with the IFR property. Since most well-known distributions satisfy the IFR property, and inventory constraints are operative in many real-world situations, our results significantly extend the scope of the optimality of quota-bonus contracts and underscore the importance of considering the inventory aspect while making sales-force compensation decisions.",Operations Research,2016,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/impact-inventory-quota-bonus-contracts-rent-sharing-0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01044824135532774,False,

The operational activities associated with participating in an auction, i.e., submitting the bid and the ad copy, customizing bids and ad copies based on various factors (such as the geographical region from which the query originated, the time of day and the season, the characteristics of the searcher), and continuously measuring outcomes, involve considerable effort. We call the costs that arise from such activities keyword management costs. To reduce these costs and increase advertisers’ participation in keyword auctions, search engines offer an opt-in tool called broad match with automatic and flexible bidding, wherein the search engine automatically places bids on behalf of the advertisers and takes over the above activities as well. The bids are based on the search engine’s estimates of the advertisers’ valuations and, therefore, may be less accurate than the bids the advertisers would have turned in themselves. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine the strategic role of keyword management costs, and of broad match, in sponsored search advertising. We show that because these costs inhibit participation by advertisers in keyword auctions, the search engine has to reduce the reserve price, which reduces the search engine’s profits. This motivates the search engine to offer broad match as a tool to reduce keyword management costs. If the accuracy of broad match bids is sufficiently high, advertisers adopt broad match and benefit from the cost reduction, whereas if the accuracy is very low, advertisers do not use it. Interestingly, at moderate levels of bid accuracy, advertisers individually find it attractive to reduce costs by using broad match, but competing advertisers also adopt broad match and the increased competition hurts all advertisers’ profits, thus creating a “prisoner’s dilemma.” When advertisers adopt broad match, search engine profits increase. It therefore seems natural to expect that the search engine will be motivated to improve broad match accuracy. Our analysis shows that the search engine will increase broad match accuracy up to the point where advertisers choose broad match, but that increasing the accuracy any further reduces the search engine’s profits.",Marketing Science,2016,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/keyword-management-costs-and-broad-match-sponsored-search-advertising,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.007135755689428421,False,

To our knowledge, existing matching methods are only able to achieve, at most, two of these goals simultaneously. Also, unlike most matching methods, the proposed methods do not require estimation of the propensity score or other dimensionality reduction techniques, although with the proposed methods these can be used as additional balancing covariates in the context of (iii).

Greater need to belong and racial identification (Study 1), and two types of social belonging threats — social exclusion (Studies 2a and 2b) and racial identity threat (Study 3) — predicted more categorizations of racially ambiguous Black/White faces as Black, with White participants more likely to categorize ambiguous faces as outgroup members (i.e., Black; Studies 1, 2a, 2b, and 3) and Black participants more likely to categorize ambiguous faces as ingroup members (Study 2b).

Participants who recalled preoccupying secrets made more extreme judgments of an external environment, supporting the notion that secrecy is burdensome. This influence was found, however, only among a subset of participants (i.e., participants who successfully recalled secrets that corresponded to their condition). We introduce the concept of manipulation correspondence to understand these patterns of results. Without taking into account whether participants' recalled secrets corresponded to their manipulation, there was no main effect of the recall manipulation on hill slant judgments. Among participants whose secrets did not correspond with the manipulation, a contrast effect emerged (i.e., influences on perceptual judgments opposite to the intention of the recall prompts). Moreover, the very process of recalling a secret in response to a prompt can lead to contrast from that prompt. Exposing participants to extreme exemplar secrets can experimentally produce, or counteract, this contrast effect. Preoccupying secrets are burdensome but tests of this phenomenon must take into account whether participants are actually preoccupied with their secrets (i.e., whether their recalled secrets correspond with the experimental manipulation), or experimentally ensure that participants judge their secrets as in line with the manipulation.

We further examined the role of political ideology in perceptions of rights. Results indicated a significant decline in the degree of recognition of entities’ rights (the company itself) in comparison to natural persons’ rights (owners and employees). Results also demonstrated an effect of the type of entity at stake: Larger, for-profit businesses were less likely to be viewed as rights holders compared with nonprofit entities. Although both tendencies persisted across the ideological spectrum, ideological differences emerged in the relations between corporate and individual rights: these were positively related among conservatives but negatively related among liberals. Finally, we found that the desire to protect citizens (compared with businesses) underlies individuals’ willingness to grant rights to companies.

The former is linked to stimulus ideas, and the latter may be viewed as a first step toward problem decomposition. The authors propose that the effects of both stimulus ideas and problem decomposition are moderated by consumers' domain-specific knowledge. In particular, concrete cues such as stimulus ideas are more beneficial to low-knowledge consumers, and high-knowledge consumers are better served with abstract cues such as the ones offered by problem decomposition. The authors' hypotheses are supported by an extensive empirical investigation involving more than 6,000 participants. The findings suggest that online idea generation platforms should use problem decomposition more explicitly and that firms should not immediately show other participants' ideas to high-knowledge consumers when they access the platform.

I analyze the effect that pharmaceutical innovation had on premature cancer mortality in Canada during the period 2000-2011, by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in the premature mortality rate, controlling for changes in the incidence rate. Premature mortality before age 75 is significantly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs registered at least 10 years earlier. Since mean utilization of drugs that have been marketed for less than 10 years is only one-sixth as great as mean utilization of drugs that have been marketed for at least a decade, it is not surprising that premature mortality is strongly inversely related only to the cumulative number of drugs that had been registered at least ten years earlier. Premature mortality before age 65 and 55 is also strongly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs that had been registered at least ten years earlier. None of the estimates of the effect of incidence on mortality are statistically significant. Controlling for the cumulative number of drugs, the cumulative number of chemical subgroups does not have a statistically significant effect on premature mortality. This suggests that drugs (chemical substances) within the same class (chemical subgroup) are not therapeutically equivalent. During the period 2000-2011, the premature (before age 75) cancer mortality rate declined by about 9%. The estimates imply that, in the absence of pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996, the premature cancer mortality rate would have increased about 12% during the period 2000-2011. A substantial decline in the ""competing risk"" of death from cardiovascular disease could account for this. The estimates imply that pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996 reduced the number of years of potential life lost to cancer before age 75 in 2011 by 105,366. The cost per life-year before age 75 gained from previous pharmaceutical innovation is estimated to have been 2730 USD. Most of the previously-registered drugs were off-patent by 2011, but evidence suggests that, even if these drugs had been sold at branded rather than generic prices, the cost per life-year gained would have been below 11,000 USD, a figure well below even the lowest estimates of the value of a life-year gained. The largest reductions in premature mortality occur at least a decade after drugs are registered, when their utilization increases significantly. This suggests that, if Canada is to obtain substantial additional reductions in premature cancer mortality in the future (a decade or more from now) at a modest cost, pharmaceutical innovation (registration of new drugs) is needed today.",International Journal of Health Economics and Management,2015,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/impact-pharmaceutical-innovation-premature-cancer-mortality-canada-2000-2011,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.05971903932898034,True,premature mortality; under-5 mortality

The main opportunities for organic growth lie in new products, brand building, customer management and channel innovation. There are many sources of growth ideas and the paths toward organic revenue goals are multiple. The key is to generate a large number of ideas and then select the most promising among them. While the most obvious one is technology development, there are other useful approaches as well, like observing or asking consumers, co-creation projects or systematic approaches to ideation.

Advertisers join these markets with a pre-specified budget and participate in multiple second-price auctions over the length of a campaign. This paper studies the competitive landscape that arises in Ad Exchanges and the implications for publishers' decisions. The presence of budgets introduces dynamic interactions among advertisers that need to be taken into account when attempting to characterize the bidding landscape or the impact of changes in the auction design. To this end, we introduce the notion of a Fluid Mean Field Equilibrium (FMFE) that is behaviorally appealing, computationally tractable, and in some important cases yields a closed-form characterization. We establish that a FMFE approximates well the rational behavior of advertisers in these markets. We then show how this framework may be used to provide sharp prescriptions for key auction design decisions that publishers face in these markets. In particular, we show that ignoring budgets, a common practice in this literature, can result in significant profit losses for the publisher when setting the reserve price.",Management Science,2015,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/repeated-auctions-budgets-ad-exchanges-approximations-and-design,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.009057069169231899,False,

We estimate that almost two-thirds (0.99 years) of the 1997–2005 increase in the life expectancy of American myeloma patients was due to an increase in the number of chemotherapy regimens now preferred by specialists. Based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation, this means that the cost per US life-year gained from post-1997 chemotherapy innovation is unlikely to have exceeded $46,000. We also investigate the impact of chemotherapy innovation on the myeloma mortality rate using longitudinal country-level data on 38 countries during the period 2002–2012. Countries that had larger increases in the number of chemotherapy regimens now preferred by specialists had larger subsequent declines in myeloma mortality rates, controlling for myeloma incidence. The (marginal) effect on the mortality rate of one additional preferred chemotherapy regimen is similar in other countries to its effect in the US. Non-US prices of two of the three new drugs were lower than US prices, so recent myeloma chemotherapy innovation may have been more cost-effective in other countries than it was in the US.

Most of these studies have examined the impact of innovation in pharmaceuticals, the most research-intensive medical good or service. Two measures of medical innovation that have been used are the mean vintage of the medical goods or procedures used by an individual or population, and the number of distinct products (e.g. drugs) available for treating a condition. Longevity (e.g. time till death) is the health outcome that has been analyzed the most, but several studies have studied the impact of medical (i.e. pharmaceutical) innovation on the ability of people to work or engage in activities of daily living. Some studies have been based on cross-sectional patient-level data. Others have been based on longitudinal, region-level data; they have investigated whether regions (e.g. states) undergoing more rapid medical innovation have exhibited larger improvements in health.

First, the effects of social class on unethical behavior are not invariant; rather, the effects of social class are moderated by whether unethical behavior benefits the self or others. Replicating past work, social class positively predicted unethical behavior; however, this relationship was only observed when that behavior was self-beneficial. When unethical behavior was performed to benefit others, social class negatively predicted unethical behavior; lower class individuals were more likely than upper class individuals to engage in unethical behavior. Overall, social class predicts people's tendency to behave selfishly, rather than predicting unethical behavior per se. Second, individuals' sense of power drove the effects of social class on unethical behavior. Evidence for this relationship was provided in three forms. First, income, but not education level, predicted unethical behavior. Second, feelings of power mediated the effect of social class on unethical behavior, but feelings of status did not.

Among Swiss inhabitants age 65 and over, 90% of the 1994-2010 decline in the overall death rate was due to the decline in the rate of deaths from diseases of the circulatory system. Little if any of the decline in cardiovascular mortality is likely to have been due to changes in behavioral risk factors, especially tobacco use and obesity. This study examines the impact of cardiovascular drug innovation on the longevity of elderly residents of Switzerland using cross-sectional patient-level data on about 22 thousand patients insured by a major health insurer (CSS) during the period 2003-2011. We investigate the effect of the vintage (world launch year) of the cardiovascular drugs used by an individual in 2003 on his or her longevity (time till death), controlling for several demographic characteristics and indicators of health status. We are able to track a patient’s vital status until 12/31/2011: 8 years after the end of the period in which cardiovascular drug use (and other variables) are measured. Our estimates indicate that people who used newer cardiovascular drugs in 2003 had longer time till death than people who used older cardiovascular drugs, controlling for the number of 2003 prescriptions and their distribution by main anatomical group, the number of 2003 doctor visits and their distribution by specialty, whether the person was hospitalized in 2003, sex, and age. Our most conservative estimates imply that cardiovascular drug innovation accounted for almost a quarter of the increase in longevity among elderly residents of Switzerland during 2003-2012, and that it increased their longevity by almost 3 months. Other estimates are about twice as large. All of the estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that newer classes of drugs tend to be therapeutically superior to older classes of drugs, and that newer drugs tend to be superior to older drugs within the same class. Even our more conservative estimates indicate that the use of new cardiovascular drugs by elderly residents of Switzerland has been highly cost effective.

Quantitatively, we find that the firm consistently chooses conservative leverage in line with empirical evidence in order to mitigate the debt-overhang effect on the exercising decisions for future growth options.

The customers' patience and valuation may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. For this general formulation, we prove that the firm may restrict attention to short cyclic pricing policies, which have length twice the maximum willingness to wait of the customer population. We further establish results on the suboptimality of monotone pricing policies in general, and illustrate the structure of optimal policies. These are, in a typical scenario, characterized by nested sales, where the firm offers partial discounts throughout each cycle, offers a significant discount halfway through the cycle, with the largest discount offered at the end of the cycle. From a computational perspective, we exploit the structure of the underlying problem to develop a novel dynamic programming formulation for the problem that computes an optimal pricing policy in polynomial time (in the maximum willingness-to-wait).

This manuscript presents two proof-of-concept studies, in analog samples, of ""microinterventions"" derived from regulatory focus and regulatory fit theories and targeting dysphoric and anxious symptoms. In Study 1, participants with varying levels of dysphoric and/or anxious mood were exposed to a brief intervention either to increase or to reduce engagement in personal goal pursuit, under the hypothesis that dysphoria indicates under-engagement of the promotion system whereas anxiety indicates over-engagement of the prevention system. In Study 2, participants with varying levels of dysphoric and/or anxious mood received brief training in counterfactual thinking, under the hypothesis that inducing individuals in a state of promotion failure to generate subtractive counterfactuals for past failures (a non-fit) will lessen their dejection/depression-related symptoms, whereas inducing individuals in a state of prevention failure to generate additive counterfactuals for past failures (a non-fit) will lessen their agitation/anxiety-related symptoms. In both studies, we observed discriminant patterns of reduction in distress consistent with the hypothesized links between dysfunctional states of the two motivational systems and dysphoric versus anxious symptoms.",Behavior Research and Therapy,2015,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/microinterventions-targeting-regulatory-focus-and-regulatory-fit-selectively,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.02891861100606898,False,mental health

Accordingly, we conducted a large-scale (N 4,811), multisite (5 labs), multimeasure (5 narcissism measures) and dual-language (English and German) investigation to quantify how strongly narcissism is related to using more first-person singular pronouns across different theoretically relevant communication contexts (identity-related, personal, impersonal, private, public, and stream-of-consciousness tasks). Overall (r .01, 95% CI [.02, .04]) and within the sampled contexts, narcissism was unrelated to use of first-person singular pronouns (total, subjective, objective, and possessive). This consistent near-zero effect has important implications for making inferences about narcissism from pronoun use and prompts questions about why I-talk tends to be strongly perceived as an indicator of narcissism in the absence of an underlying actual association between the 2 variables.",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2015,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/narcissism-and-use-personal-pronouns-revisited,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.007213092234669762,False,
"Scott K. Shriver. “Network Effects in Alternative Fuel Adoption: Empirical Analysis of the Market for Ethanol.” Marketing Science vol. 34 , (January 01, 2015): 78 - 97 .", Scott K. Shriver,"This paper investigates the importance of network effects in the demand for ethanol-compatible vehicles and the supply of ethanol fuel retailers. An indirect network effect, or positive feedback loop, arises in this context due to spatially-dependent complementarities in the availability of ethanol fuel and the installed base of ethanol-compatible vehicles. Marketers and social planners are interested in whether these effects exist, and if so, how policy might accelerate adoption of the ethanol fuel standard within a targeted population. To measure these feedback effects, I develop an econometric framework that considers the simultaneous determination of ethanol-compatible vehicle demand and ethanol fuel supply in local markets. The demand-side of the model considers the automobile purchase decisions of consumers and fleet operators, and the supply-side model considers the ethanol market entry decisions of competing fuel retailers. I propose new estimators that address the endogeneity induced by the co-determination of alternative fuel vehicle demand and alternative fuel supply. I estimate the model using zip code level panel data from six states over a six year period. I find the network effect to be highly significant, both statistically and economically. Under typical market conditions, entry of an additional ethanol fuel retailer leads to a 12% increase in consumer demand for ethanol compatible vehicles. The entry model estimates imply that a monopolist requires a local installed base of at least 204 ethanol-compatible vehicles to be profitable. As an application, I demonstrate how the model estimates can inform the promotional strategy of a vehicle manufacturer. Counter-factual simulations indicate that subsidizing fuel retailers to offer ethanol can be an effective policy to indirectly increase ethanol-compatible vehicle sales.",Marketing Science,2015,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/network-effects-alternative-fuel-adoption-empirical-analysis-market-ethanol,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.02606301593178603,False,

Second, power leads people to focus more on their self, relative to others. Thus, those with power are more likely to engage in self-beneficial behavior, but those who lack power are more prone to engage in other-beneficial unethical behavior.

Zubizarreta,"Weighting methods that adjust for observed covariates, such as inverse probability weighting, are widely used for causal inference and estimation with incomplete outcome data. Part of the appeal of such methods is that one set of weights can be used to estimate a range of treatment effects based on different outcomes, or a variety of population means for several variables. However, this appeal can be diminished in practice by the instability of the estimated weights and by the di_x000E_fficulty of adequately adjusting for observed covariates in some settings. To address these limitations, this paper presents a new weighting method that finds the weights of minimum variance that adjust or balance the empirical distribution of the observed covariates up to levels prespecified by the researcher. This method allows the researcher to balance very precisely the means of the observed covariates and other features of their marginal and joint distributions, such as variances and correlations and also, for example, the quantiles of interactions of pairs and triples of observed covariates, thus balancing entire two- and three-way marginals. Since the weighting method is based on a well-defined convex optimization problem, duality theory provides insight into the behavior of the variance of the optimal weights in relation to the level of covariate balance adjustment, answering the question, how much does tightening a balance constraint increase the variance of the weights? Also, the weighting method runs in polynomial time so relatively large data sets can be handled quickly. An implementation of the method is provided in the new package sbw for R. This paper shows some theoretical properties of the resulting weights and illustrates their use by analyzing both a data set from the 2010 Chilean earthquake and a simulated example.",Journal of the American Statistical Association,2015,https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/stable-weights-balance-covariates-estimation-incomplete-outcome-data,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.007217706768320197,False,

We established the role that impurity played in these effects through mediation and moderation. We found that inauthenticity-induced cleansing and compensatory helping were driven by heightened feelings of impurity rather than from the psychological discomfort of dissonance. Similarly, physically cleansing oneself eliminated the relationship between inauthenticity and prosocial compensation. Finally, we demonstrated additional evidence for discriminant validity: These effects were not driven by general negative experiences (i.e., failing a test) but were unique to experiences of inauthenticity.

The current review critically examines perspective-taking research conducted by both management scholars and social psychologists and specifies perspective-taking's antecedents, consequences, mechanisms, and moderators, as well as identifies theoretical and/or empirical shortfalls. Our summary of the current state of perspective-taking research offers three important contributions. First, we offer a new definition of perspective-taking: the active cognitive process of imagining the world from another's vantage point or imagining oneself in another's shoes to understand their visual viewpoint, thoughts, motivations, intentions, and/or emotions. Second, we highlight that although perspective-taking has many positive benefits for managers and leaders, it also carries with it the potential for perverse effects. Third, we argue that previous theoretical lenses to understand perspective-taking's goal are insufficient in light of all the available evidence. Instead, we offer a new theoretical proposition to capture the full range of perspective-taking's positive and negative effects: perspective-taking helps individuals effectively navigate a world filled with mixed-motive social interactions.

Overall, the results suggest that advocates for torture may readily interpret ambiguous evidence as implying the value and necessity of extreme interrogation techniques when used by the ingroup.

In this work, we propose a class of proactive policies which utilizes future information of potential patient arrivals to effectively manage admissions into an ED while reducing waiting times for patients who are eventually treated. Instead of the standard strategy of waiting for queues to build before diverting patients, the proposed policy utilizes the predictions to identify when congestion is going to increase and proactively diverts patients before things get ""too bad."" We demonstrate that the proposed policy provides delay improvements over standard policies used in practice. We also consider the impact of errors in the information provided by the predictive models and find that even with noisy predictions, our proposed policies can still outperform (achieving shorter delays while serving the same number of patients) standard diversion policies. If the quality of the predictive model is insufficient, then it is better to ignore the future information and simply rely on real-time, current information for the basis of decision making.

A selective-attention account predicts that motivated and skeptical offer-recipients focus overwhelmingly on the attractive endpoint (i.e., a buyer would hear, in effect, “I want $7,200”). In contrast, we propose a tandem anchoring account, arguing that offer-recipients are often influenced by both endpoints as they judge the offer-maker’s reservation price (i.e., bottom line) as well as how polite they believe an extreme (nonaccommodating) counteroffer would be. In 5 studies, featuring scripted negotiation scenarios and live dyadic negotiations, we find that certain range offers yield improved settlement terms for offer-makers without relational costs, whereas others may yield relationship benefits without deal costs. We clarify the types of range offers that evoke these benefits and identify boundaries to their impact, including range width and extremity. In addition, our studies reveal evidence consistent with 2 proposed mechanisms, one involving an informational effect (both endpoints of range offers can be taken as signals of an offer-maker’s reservation price) and another involving a politeness effect (range offers can make extreme counteroffers seem less polite).
