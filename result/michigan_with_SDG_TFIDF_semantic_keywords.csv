b17d3d619078d16fc548474493372727b0ced63b,Allan Afuah,"A Critical Assessment of Business Model Research 
Opens a new window","Ever since the Internet boom of the mid-1990s, firms have been experimenting with new ways of doing business and achieving their goals, which has led to a branching of the scholarly literature on business models. Three interpretations of the meaning and function of “business models” have emerged from the management literature: (1) business models as attributes of real firms, (2) business models as cognitive/linguistic schemas, and (3) business models as formal conceptual representations of how a business functions. Relatedly, a provocative debate about the relationship between business models and strategy has fascinated many scholars. We offer a critical review of this now vast business model literature with the goal of organizing the literature and achieving greater understanding of the larger picture in this increasingly important research area. In addition to complementing and extending prior reviews, we also aim at a second and more important contribution: We aim at identifying the reasons behind the apparent lack of agreement in the interpretation of business models, and the relationship between business models and strategy. Whether strategy scholars consider business model research a new field may be due to the fact that the business model perspective may be challenging the assumptions of traditional theories of value creation and capture by focusing on value creation on the demand side and supply side, rather than focusing on value creation on the supply side only as these theories have done. We conclude by discussing how the business model perspective can contribute to research in different fields, offering future research directions.",Crossref,0.0,10.5465/annals.2014.0072,https://doi.org/10.5465/annals.2014.0072,2017.0,Academy of Management Annals,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:A Critical Assessment of Business Model Research Opens a new window,A Critical Assessment of Business Model Research,10.5465/annals.2014.0072,,Goal 9,0.01657914344849639,False,

Opens a new window","Many sellers allow consumers to pay with reward points instead of cash or credit card. While the revenue implications of cash and credit card purchases are transparent, the implications of reward sales are not trivial, especially when a firm that issues points is not a seller. In this case, a seller receives a monetary compensation or reimbursement from the point issuer when a consumer purchases the good by redeeming points. In this paper, we examine how reward sales influence a seller’s pricing and inventory decisions. In particular, we consider a consumer who can choose to pay with cash or points based on her attributes – reservation price, point balance, and the perceived value of a point. Then, we incorporate this consumer choice model into a dynamic pricing model where a seller earns revenues from both cash and reward sales. In contrast to an intuition that adding reward sales will increase sales and revenue, we show that the effect of reward sales on the seller’s price is non-trivial as the seller could either add a premium or offer a discount depending on the inventory level, time, and the reimbursement rate. Furthermore, such price adjustments (premium or discount) can attenuate the optimal mark-up or mark-down level, and reduce the price fluctuation caused by inventory level and remaining time. We also investigate several settings where the seller has a different level of operational control over reward sales and show that the seller blocks the reward sales only when the reimbursement rate is very low. That is, allowing reward sales is still better even when the revenue from the reward sales is smaller than the cash sales. In addition, we find that a seller with an ability to control reward availability (i.e., allow a reward sale or not) can achieve a revenue similar to the revenue of a seller with ability to change point requirements and price at the same time.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.3426903,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3426903,2019.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Dynamic Pricing with Point Redemption Opens a new window,Dynamic Pricing with Point Redemption,10.2139/ssrn.3426903,,Goal 8,0.004440998699167724,False,

The seller has private information about the product quality, which is unknown to customers in advance and publicly revealed in spot. The question we consider is whether the seller has an incentive to signal quality in advance and, if so, how she can convey a credible signal of product quality.

We characterize the seller's signaling strategy and find that rationing of capacity in the advance period is an effective tool of signaling product quality. We find that the high-quality seller can distinguish herself by allocating less capacity than the low-quality seller in the advance period. We show that this signaling mechanism exists whenever advance selling would be optimal for both the high-quality and low-quality sellers if quality information was symmetric. We compare capacity rationing with other signaling tools, such as pricing and advertising, and show that capacity rationing is the preferred one.

Despite its capability of conveying quality information more efficiently than other tools, capacity rationing may still be very costly for the seller. When compared to the case when rationing was not allowed, the seller's ability to ration (rationing flexibility) sometimes makes the seller worse off, independently of her quality.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.2313474,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2313474,2012.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Rationing Capacity in Advance to Signal Quality,Rationing Capacity in Advance Selling to Signal Quality,10.2139/ssrn.2313474,,Goal 17,0.0287020236930696,False,capacity building; statistical capacity building

While these and other literature streams offer valuable insights about growth, they lack integration, resulting in an incomplete understanding of how employees achieve personal growth at work. To further research on personal growth in organizations, we review 292 articles from six streams of organizational and psychology literature that explore various aspects of personal growth. We provide an integration of the existing literature by developing a clear definition of personal growth, offering an integrative process model of personal growth, identifying opportunities for cross-pollination across growth literatures, and providing a clear agenda for future research on this topic.

Collectivistic values directly and indirectly increase both religious and thriftiness values, both of which negatively affect status consumption values. However, the direct positive effect of collectivistic values on status consumption values is so strong that it dominates all of these countervailing negative effects, which explains the paradoxical affinity of Asian consumers towards luxury consumption while endorsing the moral virtues of thriftiness. We identify the effects these values have on preference towards symbolic (style, prestige, overseas origin) and utilitarian (durability, and value for price) attributes. Our results have implications for international marketing theory by highlighting the role of values in Asian consumption, and for practice by helping marketers arrive at more informed standardized brand/product strategies in these rapidly growing Asian markets.

Opens a new window","Creative industries produce many one-hit wonders who struggle to repeat their initial success and fewer hit makers who sustain success over time. To develop theory on the role of creativity in driving sustained market success, I propose a path dependence theory of creators’ careers that considers creators’ whole portfolios of products over time and how their early portfolios shape their later capacity to sustain success. The main idea is that a creator’s path to sustained success depends on the creativity in their portfolio at the time of their initial hit—relatively creative portfolios give creators more options for leveraging their past portfolios while adapting to market changes, increasing their odds of additional hits. I tested the proposed theory using an archival study of the U.S. music industry from 1959–2010, including data on over 3 million songs by 69,050 artists, and the results largely support the hypotheses. Artists who reached their initial hits with relatively creative (novel or varied) portfolios were more likely to generate additional hits, but a novel portfolio was less likely to yield an initial hit than was a typical portfolio. These findings suggest that new creators face a tradeoff between their likelihood of initial versus sustained success, such that building a relatively creative early portfolio is a risky bet that can make or break a creator’s career.",Crossref,0.0,10.1049/me:19910174,https://doi.org/10.1049/me:19910174,1991.0,Manufacturing Engineer,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:One-hit wonders versus hit makers: Sustaining success in creative industries Ope,One hit wonders,10.1049/me:19910174,,Goal 17,0.01029922083816975,False,

Yet, little is known about the relational benefits and risks of acknowledging others’ emotions in the workplace.

We hypothesize that emotional acknowledgment acts as a costly signal of the perceiver’s willingness to expend personal resources to meet the needs of the expresser. Across six studies, we found convergent evidence that emotional acknowledgment led to greater perceptions of costliness, and in turn, to higher evaluations of trust. These effects were stronger for negative than positive emotions because acknowledging negative emotions involved a greater perceived cost.

Under this policy, patients designate a médecin traitant, typically a general practitioner, who will be their first point of contact during an episode of care and who will provide referrals to specialists. A key element of the policy is that patients who self-refer to a specialist face higher cost sharing than if they received a referral from their médecin traitant. We consider the effect of this policy on the utilization of physician services. Our analysis of administrative claims data spanning the years 2000–2008 indicates that visits to specialists, which were increasing in the years prior to the implementation of the reform, fell after the policy was in place. Additional evidence from the administrative claims as well as survey data suggest that this decline arose from a reduction in self-referrals, which is consistent with the objectives of the policy. Visits fell significantly both for specialties targeted by the policy and specialties for which self-referrals are still allowed for certain treatments.

Conclusive evidence from coverage expansions that occurred in 2014 is several years away. In the meantime, we analyzed the experience of hospitals in Connecticut, which expanded Medicaid coverage to a large number of childless adults in April 2010 under the ACA. Using hospital-level panel data from Medicare cost reports, we performed difference-in-differences analyses to compare the change in Medicaid volume and uncompensated care in the period 2007–13 in Connecticut to changes in other Northeastern states. We found that early Medicaid expansion in Connecticut was associated with an increase in Medicaid discharges of 7–9 percentage points, relative to a baseline rate of 11 percent, and an increase of 7–8 percentage points in Medicaid revenue as a share of total revenue, relative to a baseline share of 10 percent. Also, in contrast to the national and regional trends of increasing uncompensated care during this period, hospitals in Connecticut experienced no increase in uncompensated care. We conclude that uncompensated care in Connecticut was roughly one-third lower than what it would have been without early Medicaid expansion.

Now one in four Australians is considered obese, defined as having a body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) of 30 or over. The analysis is based on a random sample survey of over 240,000 adults aged 45 and over that is linked at the individual-level to comprehensive administrative health care claims for the period 2006–2009. This sub-population group has an obesity rate that is nearly 30% and is a major consumer of health services. Relative to the average annual health expenditures of those with normal weight, we find that the health expenditures of those with a BMI between 30 and 35 (obese type I) are 19% higher and expenditures of those with BMI greater than 35 (obese type II/III) are 51% higher. We find large and significant differences in all types of care: inpatient, emergency department, outpatient and prescription drugs. The obesity-related health expenditures are higher for obese type I women than men, but in the obese type II/III state, obesity-related expenditures are higher for men. When we stratify further by age groups, we find that obesity has the largest impact among men over age 75 and women aged 60–74 years old.

2a2acd89ae1ba4b24728c4b11089a924aa39fa60,Katherine Burson,Income Tax and the Motivation to Work,"Does income tax influence the motivation to work? We propose that the degree of effort exertion in the presence of income tax depends on people’s attitudes toward two key components of taxation: redistribution and government intervention. For people favorable toward both, working while taxed is aligned with personal identity and may actually enhance motivation. All others, however, may find taxes demotivating. In two incentive-compatible labor experiments, framing wages as subject to an income tax reduced participants’ productivity unless they were chronically favorable toward both redistribution and government intervention.

In combination, these changes are compatible with new forms of non-corporate enterprise. While corporations are basic units of production in many theories about the economy, they should be regarded as only one hypothesis about how production is and can be organized. Traditional alternatives to the corporation include producer and consumer cooperatives (e.g., Land o’ Lakes, REI) and mutuals (e.g., State Farm, Vanguard).

Some of the most well-established findings in the sociology of networks sprang from this milieu.

For the problem where the number of selling periods and initial capacity are scaled by k > 0, it is known that the revenue loss of any non-anticipating pricing policy is Ω(√ k). However, there is a considerable gap between this theoretical lower bound and the performance bound of the best known heuristic.

Our study is motivated by firms that utilize dynamic pricing as well as customer upgrades, as ex-ante and ex-post mechanisms, respectively, to mitigate inventory mismatches. To gain insight into how offering product upgrades impacts optimal price selection, we formulate a multiple period, nested two-stage model where the firm first sets prices and replenishment levels for each product while the demand is still uncertain, and after observing the demand, decides how many (if any) of the customers to upgrade to a higher quality product. We characterize the structure of the optimal upgrade, pricing and replenishment policies and find that firms having greater flexibility to offer product upgrades can restrain their reliance on dynamic pricing, enabling them to better protect the price differentiation between the products. We also show how the quality differential between the products or changes in the replenishment cost structures influence the optimal policy. Using insights gained from the optimal policy structure, we construct a heuristic policy and find that it performs well across various parameter values.

Opens a new window","Power differences are ubiquitous in social settings. However, the question of whether groups with higher or lower power disparity achieve better performance has thus far received conflicting answers. To address this issue, we identify 3 underlying assumptions in the literature that may have led to these divergent findings, including a myopic focus on static hierarchies, an assumption that those at the top of hierarchies are competent at group tasks, and an assumption that equality is not possible. We employ a multimethod set of studies to examine these assumptions and to understand when power disparity will help or harm group performance. First, our agent-based simulation analyses show that by unpacking these common implicit assumptions in power research, we can explain earlier disparate findings—power disparity benefits group performance when it is dynamically aligned with the power holder’s task competence, and harms group performance when held constant and/or is not aligned with task competence. Second, our empirical findings in both a field study of fraud investigation groups and a multiround laboratory study corroborate the simulation results. We thereby contribute to research on power by highlighting a dynamic understanding of power in groups and explaining how current implicit assumptions may lead to opposing findings.

However, theories on social hierarchy suggest that autocratic leadership may also positively affect morale and performance through the creation of a psychologically appealing, hierarchically-ordered environment of predictability and security. We propose that autocratic leadership can foster team psychological safety when team members accept the hierarchy within the team. In contrast, when members challenge the hierarchy and engage in intrateam power struggles, autocratic leaders' centralizing power behaviors will clash with team members' competition for power and frustrate members, impairing psychological safety and performance. We find support for these ideas in a study of 60 retail outlets (225 employees and their managers) in the financial services industry. As expected, when team power struggles were low, autocratic leadership was positively related to team psychological safety, and thereby indirectly positively related to team performance.

We show that a Use-down-to/Balancing Production Policy and modified Order-up-to Ordering Policy is optimal. Our sensitivity analysis of the optimal policy reveals some counter intuitive results when the availability of the raw materials is stochastic. For example, it may be optimal for the firm to use strictly less of the operationally more efficient material when the demand for the end product stochastically increases. Since using a brute-force approach to compute the optimal policy is time-consuming due to the curse of dimensionality of the dynamic program, we use the structural properties of the optimal policy to develop an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal policy.

We develop theory about how political liberalism versus conservatism affects supervisors’ perceptions and allocative decision-making. Combining internal personnel and billings data with publicly available political donation records in a large law firm, we test the effect of political ideology among supervising law firm partners on the performance-based bonuses awarded to male and female subordinate lawyers. We find the male–female gender gap in performance-based pay is reduced for professional workers tied to liberal supervisors, relative to conservative supervisors. We further find this political ideology effect increases for workers with greater seniority in the organization. Our findings contribute to an understanding of the determinants of the gender earnings gap, suggesting that, in settings where managers have leeway over rewards and careers, their personal political beliefs have an important influence on outcomes for male and female workers.",Crossref,0.0,10.5465/amj.2016.0179,https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2016.0179,2017.0,Academy of Management Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Bringing the boss’s politics in: Supervisor political ideology and the gender ga,Bringing the Boss’s Politics In: Supervisor Political Ideology and the Gender Gap in Earnings,10.5465/amj.2016.0179,,Goal 5,0.0841203604047857,True,gender bias; gender equity; gender inequality; gender wage gap; gender-sensitive budgeting; women in the workforce

A stigma threat perspective on the implications of an autism diagnosis for workplace well-being. 101(3):430-449.,"This article unpacks the stigma associated with a developmental disability at work, specifically autism spectrum disorders (ASD), by presenting findings from 2 studies—one interview-based and the other survey-based. Drawing on in-depth interviews with individuals on the autism spectrum, the first study showed that a clinical diagnosis of autism is a milestone event that triggered both positive (silver linings) and negative (dark clouds) responses to work. These positive and negative responses were shaped by the age at which the diagnosis occurred as well as specific work-related contingencies—identity management (disclosing or not disclosing), the importance of the social demands imposed by the job, and organizational support polices for autism. The second study developed and tested propositions derived from the qualitative data by using survey data gathered from working adults with ASD. Results showed that, compared with individuals diagnosed later in life, individuals who were diagnosed at an earlier age experienced greater organization-based self-esteem and lower perceived discrimination when they disclosed their disability, worked in jobs that placed lower social demands on them, or were employed in organizations that offered policies to support workers with ASD. We conclude that, depending on the age of diagnosis, attributes of the employment context can trigger stigma-related threat in different ways and we outline important practical implications of these findings.

The percentage of men in an occupation and the complexity of jobs performed by employees enhanced the male–female gap in performance and rewards. In highly prestigious occupations, women performed equally, but were rewarded significantly lower than men.

Furthermore, when the degree of unused resources is high, managerial pessimism is associated with anti-sticky cost behavior but managerial optimism reverses this relation and results in cost stickiness. Finally, we find the strongest cost stickiness under the following: a low degree of unused resources, a high magnitude of adjustment costs, and optimistic managerial expectations; by contrast, the strongest cost anti-stickiness occurs when all three drivers operate in the opposite direction.

However, when pending current orders are consolidated with future orders it may require more expensive expedited shipment in order to meet shorter deadlines. In this paper, we study the optimal consolidation policy focusing on the trade-off between economies of scale and expedited shipping costs. Academic/Practical Relevance: Our work is motivated by the prevalence of consolidation in the supply chain industry and also by its potential application for online and omni-channel retailing, especially with the rise of, so-called, on-demand logistic services. In such situations, sellers, have the flexibility to take advantage of consolidation, by deciding from which warehouse to fulfill the orders and also when to ship the orders, as long as the orders deadlines are met. Methodology: We use Dynamic Programming to study the optimal policy and its structure. We also conduct intensive simulation tests to show the good performance of heuristics which we proposed based on structures of the optimal policy. Results: The optimal policies and their structures are characterized in settings with up to two warehouses, where the impact of expedited shipment on both shipping policy and order fulfillment policy are explored. Utilizing the insights of these structural properties, two easily implementable heuristics are proposed, which perform within 1-2% of the optimal in intensive numerical tests.

Such information is useful, not only to the consumers that have not yet purchased the product, but also to the firm. The informativeness of the consumer-generated quality information depends, however, on the volume of consumers who share their opinions and, thus, depends on the initial sales volume. Hence, via its initial price, the firm not only influences its revenue but also controls the quality information flow over time. The firm may either enhance or dampen the quality information flow via increasing or decreasing initial sales. The corresponding pricing strategy to steer the quality information flow is not always intuitive. Compared to the case without consumer-generated quality information, the firm may reduce the initial sales and lower the initial price. Interestingly, the firm may get strictly worse off due to the consumer-generated quality information. Even when the firm benefits from consumer-generated quality information, it may prefer less accurate information.

The seller has private information about the product quality, which is unknown to customers in advance and publicly revealed in spot. The question we consider is whether the seller has an incentive to signal quality in advance and, if so, how she can convey a credible signal of product quality.

We characterize the seller's signaling strategy and find that rationing of capacity in the advance period is an effective tool of signaling product quality. We find that the high-quality seller can distinguish herself by allocating less capacity than the low-quality seller in the advance period. We show that this signaling mechanism exists whenever advance selling would be optimal for both the high-quality and low-quality sellers if quality information was symmetric. We compare capacity rationing with other signaling tools, such as pricing and advertising, and show that capacity rationing is the preferred one.

Despite its capability of conveying quality information more efficiently than other tools, capacity rationing may still be very costly for the seller.

Caloric overconsumption, rather than lack of exercise, is the primary driver of overweight and obesity. We review people’s beliefs about the causes of obesity, the origins and consequences of these beliefs, and suggest possible mechanisms for corrective action.

Recent Findings
In multiple samples across the world, approximately half of the population mistakenly believes that lack of exercise is the primary cause of obesity. These misbeliefs have consequences: people who underestimate the importance of one’s diet are more likely to be overweight or obese than people who correctly believe that diet is the primary cause of obesity. Next, we discuss the systematic misrepresentation of these factors—which we call “leanwashing”—by the food and beverage industry. Corporate messaging and actions are likely contributing factors to these mistaken beliefs being so widespread, and thus corrective actions are required. These include regulation and taxation.

In this paper we introduce a broad family of preference functions that can represent a wide variety of preference structures. We develop the necessary theory and interactive algorithms for both the general family of the preference functions and for its special cases. The algorithms guarantee to find the most preferred solution (point) of the decision maker under the assumed conditions. The convergence of the algorithms are achieved by progressively reducing the solution space based on the preference information obtained from the decision maker and the properties of the assumed underlying preference functions. We first demonstrate the algorithms on a simple bi-criteria problem with a given set of available points. We also test the performances of the algorithms on three-criteria knapsack problems and show that they work well.,Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.ejor.2017.07.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2017.07.028,2018.0,European Journal of Operational Research,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Interactive Algorithms for a Broad Underlying Family of Preference Functions,Interactive algorithms for a broad underlying family of preference functions,10.1016/j.ejor.2017.07.028,,Goal 5,0.01266172014987085,False,

Opens a new window","Although recently some research has been accumulated on emotional expressions in negotiations, there is little research on whether expressing sadness could have any effect in negotiations. We propose that sadness expressions can increase the expressers’ ability to claim value in negotiations because they make recipients experience greater other-concern for the expresser. However, only when the social situation provides recipients with reasons to experience concern for the expresser in the first place, will recipients act on their other-concern and, eventually, concede more to a sad expresser. Three experiments tested this proposition by examining face-to-face, actual negotiations (in which participants interacted with each other). In all 3 experiments, recipients conceded more to a sad expresser when, but only when, features of the social situation provided reasons to experience other-concern for the expresser, namely (a) when recipients perceived the expresser as low power (Experiment 1), (b) when recipients anticipated a future interaction (Experiment 1), (c) when recipients construed the relationship as collaborative in nature (Experiment 2), or (d) when recipients believed that it was inappropriate to blame others (Experiment 3). All 3 experiments showed that the positive effect of sadness expression was mediated by the recipients’ greater other-concern. These findings extend previous research on emotional expressions in negotiations by emphasizing a distinct psychological mechanism.

Opens a new window","After decades of disuse, antitrust is back. Renewing the United States’ longstanding distrust of concentrated economic power, antimonopoly scholars have documented widespread harms of corporate “bigness” and inspired policy initiatives to deconcentrate the U.S. economy. To date, however, the new antitrust movement has largely overlooked a key cause of commercial concentration: the rapid consolidation of the U.S. banking sector. More than 30,000 banks served local communities a century ago, but today just six financial conglomerates control half of the U.S. banking system. Bank consolidation, in turn, has spurred conglomeration throughout the economy. As the Supreme Court recognized in 1963, “Concentration in banking accelerates concentration generally.”

This Article contends that scholars and policymakers have neglected bank antitrust law for the past forty years and thereby encouraged excessive consolidation in the banking sector and the broader economy. It argues that policymakers’ current approach to bank antitrust—premised on consumer welfare—has failed in two critical respects. First, it has failed on its own terms, as bank mergers have increased the cost and reduced the availability of basic financial services. Second, because of its narrow focus on consumer prices, the prevailing standard has ignored numerous non-price harms stemming from bank consolidation, including diminished product quality, heightened entry barriers, and greater macroeconomic instability. To correct these shortcomings, this Article proposes a roadmap for reviving bank antitrust. It recommends strengthening the analytical tools used to identify anticompetitive bank mergers and rejecting a narrow focus on consumer prices in favor of a more comprehensive analysis of the costs that bank consolidation imposes on society. Reviving bank antitrust in this way is critical to enhancing competition in the financial sector and throughout the U.S. economy.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.4039197,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4039197,2022.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Reviving Bank Antitrust Opens a new window,Reviving Bank Antitrust,10.2139/ssrn.4039197,,Goal 8,0.02462527506964623,False,Aid for Trade; access to banking; economic growth; economic inequality; economic policies; economic recovery; employment; entrepreneurship; financial institutions; financial services; financial services access; labour market

Opens a new window","The recent financial crisis demonstrated that, contrary to longstanding regulatory assumptions, nonbank financial firms — such as investment banks and insurance companies — can propagate systemic risk throughout the financial system. After the crisis, policymakers in the United States and abroad developed two different strategies for dealing with nonbank systemic risk. The first strategy seeks to regulate individual nonbank entities that officials designate as being potentially systemically important. The second approach targets financial activities that could create systemic risk, irrespective of the types of firms that engage in those transactions. In the last several years, domestic and international policymakers have come to view these two strategies as substitutes, largely abandoning entity-based designations in favor of activities-based approaches. This Article argues that this trend is deeply misguided because entity- and activities-based approaches are complementary tools that are each essential for effectively regulating nonbank systemic risk. Eliminating an entity-based approach to nonbank systemic risk — either formally or through onerous procedural requirements — would expose the financial system to the same risks that it experienced in 2008 as a result of distress at nonbanks like AIG, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers. This conclusion is especially salient in the United States, where jurisdictional fragmentation undermines the capacity of financial regulators to implement an effective activities-based approach. Significant reforms to the U.S. regulatory framework are necessary, therefore, before an activities-based approach can meaningfully complement domestic entity-based systemic risk regulation.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.3238059,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3238059,2018.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Regulating Entities and Activities: Complementary Approaches to Nonbank Systemic,Regulating Entities and Activities: Complementary Approaches to Nonbank Systemic Risk,10.2139/ssrn.3238059,,Goal 17,0.02519539978786924,False,

We argue that it is important for a regulator to monitor firms’ CM activities, and to assess how differences in the enforcement of CM laws impact the CM practice by firms. Our analytical model uses a Stackelberg leader–follower game that endogenizes the regulator’s decision to enforce CM. The firm then decides whether to truthfully declare or overstate the amount it contributes to charity (and if overstate: by how much). We find the following results in equilibrium under different conditions: (i) CM campaigns are a win–win–win situation – they increase profit for the firm while being truthful, generate larger donations for the charity, and generate a cause marketing surplus for the regulator, resulting in doing well while doing good, (ii) the best response of the firm is to be strategic, even when the regulator is strict with monitoring, (iii) the regulator itself decides not to monitor CM, even though it knows that this results in untruthful behavior by firms. When we endogenize the extent of overstatement, we find that the firm tends to be strategic by overstating donation percentage, whether the regulator is strict or not. As the proportion of unsophisticated consumers (who believe a firm’s claims, whether truthful or not) increases, the donation proportion decreases in general, and the overstatement level increases when the regulator is lenient and decreases when the regulator is strict. In equilibrium, the regulator is strict if the market size is large, and lenient otherwise.

Despite the relevance of food leftovers, downstream effects of having more food leftovers on consumers' affect and behavior are unknown. In five studies, the authors test the idea that consumers may judge their actual consumption by looking at their leftovers. As such, larger leftovers may reduce perceived consumption and also impact other eating-related behaviors. Using both real and imagined food consumption and leftovers, the authors find that, holding the absolute amount of food consumption equal, larger (vs. smaller) food leftovers lead to reduced perceived consumption. This difference in perceived consumption has consequences for people's motivation to compensate for their eating. Larger (vs. smaller) food leftovers cause them to eat more in a subsequent unrelated food consumption task, and also to exercise less in an explicit calorie compensation task. The psychological drivers of this phenomenon are twofold: larger leftovers reduce perceived consumption, which leads people to feel better about themselves; and feeling better about themselves, in turn, reduces people's motivation to compensate.

We find the association to be most influential when consumers are unaware of it and when it applies to an unfamiliar stimulus. Because all visual formats—from the printed page to screens on a television, computer, or smartphone—entail a vertical placement, this association has important managerial implications. Our studies implement multiple methodologies and technologies and use manipulations of logos, websites, food advertisements, and political slogans.",Crossref,0.0,10.1093/jcr/ucv046,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucv046,2015.0,Journal of Consumer Research,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Positioning Rationality and Emotion: Rationality Is Up and Emotion Is Down,Positioning Rationality and Emotion: Rationality Is Up and Emotion Is Down,10.1093/jcr/ucv046,,Goal 2,0.03420533394173832,False,

Opens a new window","In order to accomplish diverse tasks successfully in a dynamic (i.e., changing over time) construction environment, robots should be able to prioritize assigned tasks to optimize their performance in a given state. Recently, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach has shown potential for addressing such adaptive task allocation. It remains unanswered, however, whether or not DRL can address adaptive task allocation problems in dynamic robotic construction environments. In this paper, we developed and tested a digital twin-driven DRL learning method to explore the potential of DRL for adaptive task allocation in robotic construction environments. Specifically, the digital twin synthesizes sensory data from physical assets and is used to simulate a variety of dynamic robotic construction site conditions within which a DRL agent can interact. As a result, the agent can learn an adaptive task allocation strategy that increases project performance. We tested this method with a case project in which a virtual robotic construction project (i.e., interlocking concrete bricks are delivered and assembled by robots) was digitally twinned for DRL training and testing. Results indicated that the DRL model’s task allocation approach reduced construction time by 36% in three dynamic testing environments when compared to a rule-based imperative model. The proposed DRL learning method promises to be an effective tool for adaptive task allocation in dynamic robotic construction environments. Such an adaptive task allocation method can help construction robots cope with uncertainties and can ultimately improve construction project performance by efficiently prioritizing assigned tasks.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.aei.2022.101710,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2022.101710,2022.0,Advanced Engineering Informatics,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Digital Twin-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Task Allocation in ,Digital twin-driven deep reinforcement learning for adaptive task allocation in robotic construction,10.1016/j.aei.2022.101710,,Goal 4,0.02318865443431337,False,

This raises a conundrum: the tools we have to feel better may be ineffective when they are most needed. Recent event-related potential (ERP) research indicates that distanced self-talk (i.e., reflecting on one's experiences using non-first-person singular pronouns and one's name) reduces negative emotional reactivity without overtaxing cognitive resources. Here, we report the first direct replication of this work and extend it by examining how distanced self-talk compares to detached reappraisal, one of the most frequently studied regulatory techniques. Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to an emotion regulation picture task and instructed to reflect on the feelings they experienced in response to viewing negative emotional images using distanced self-talk or detached reappraisal while ERPs were measured. Directly replicating past findings, distanced self-talk led to a reduction in an affective arousal ERP, the late positive potential (LPP), without increasing stimulus preceding negativity (SPN), an ERP that reflects anticipatory and preparatory processing. These results further bolster support for distanced self-talk as a relatively effortless emotion regulation strategy. On the other hand, detached reappraisal was neither associated with the modulation of the LPP nor the SPN. Due to the failed replication of the reappraisal effect, a direct comparison between emotion regulation strategies was not conducted. Methodological limitations that may have contributed to the reappraisal failure and future directions for comparisons between emotion regulation strategies are discussed.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.05.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.05.003,2022.0,International Journal of Psychophysiology,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:An Event-Related Potential Investigation of Distanced Self-Talk: Replication and,An event-related potential investigation of distanced self-talk: Replication and comparison to detached reappraisal,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.05.003,,Goal 10,0.01050291467653928,False,

Yet recent research indicates that when laws are broken by people we know and love, we consistently fail to report their crimes. Here we identify an expectancy-based cognitive mechanism that underlies this phenomenon and illustrate how it interacts with people's motivations to predict their intentions to report crimes. Using a combination of self-report and brain (ERP) measures, we demonstrate that although witnessing any crime violates people's expectations, expectancy violations are stronger when close (vs. distant) others commit crimes. We further employ an experimental-causal-chain design to show that people resolve their expectancy violations in diametrically opposed ways depending on their relationship to the transgressor. When close others commit crimes, people focus more on the individual (vs. the crime), which leads them to protect the transgressor. However, the reverse is true for distant others, which leads them to punish the transgressor. These findings highlight the sensitivity of early attentional processes to information about close relationships.

Here we attempt to adjudicate between these competing considerations by examining what people think they would and should do when a close (vs. distant) other behaves immorally. Across four experiments (N = 2002), we show that people believe they morally should protect close others more than distant others.

We develop a theoretical model to reflect supplier trustworthiness, and identify when a buyer can benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We show that costly relationship-specific investments can serve as a signal of trustworthiness, and that supply chain profits increase when trustworthy suppliers are able to identify themselves in this fashion. We demonstrate the importance of the signaling mechanism using laboratory experiments. The experimental results show that relationship-specific investments lead to more collaborative transactions, with buyers offering higher prices and suppliers reciprocating with higher quality goods. This results in increased profits for both buyers and suppliers. Additionally, we show that the benefit of the relationship-specific investment depends directly on the signaling mechanism.

Opens a new window","Background
Operative time often has been cited as an important factor for postoperative outcomes. Despite this belief, most efforts to improve liver transplant outcomes have largely focused on only patient and donor factors, and little attention has been paid on operative time. The primary objective of this project was to determine the impact of operative time on graft survival after liver transplant.
Methods
A retrospective review of 2,877 consecutive liver transplants performed at a single institution was studied. Data regarding recipient, donor, and operative characteristics, including detailed granular operative times were collected prospectively and retrospectively reviewed. Using an instrument variable approach, Cox multivariate modeling was performed to assess the impact of operative time without the confounding of known and unknown variables.
Results
Of the 2,396 patients who met the criteria for review, the most important factors determining liver transplant graft survival included recipient history of Hepatitis C (hazard ratio 1.45, P = .02), donor age (hazard ratio 1.23, P = .03), use of liver graft from donation after cardiac death donor (hazard ratio 1.50, P < .01), and operative time (hazard ratio 1.26, P = .01). In detailed analysis of stages of the liver transplant operation, the time interval from incision to anhepatic phase was associated with graft survival (hazard ratio 1.33; P = .02).
Conclusion
Using a novel instrument variable approach, we demonstrate that operative time (in particular, the time interval from incision to anhepatic time) has a significant impact on graft survival.

Opens a new window","Manufacturing organizations’ environmental impacts are often attributable to processes in the firm’s upstream supply chain. Environmentally preferable procurement (EPP) and the establishment of environmental purchasing criteria can potentially reduce these indirect impacts. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can help identify the purchasing criteria that are most effective in reducing environmental impacts. However, the high costs of LCA and the problems associated with the comparability of results have limited efforts to integrate procurement performance with quantitative organizational environmental performance targets. Moreover, environmental purchasing criteria, when implemented, are often established on a product-by-product basis without consideration of other products in the procurement portfolio. We develop an approach that utilizes streamlined LCA methods, together with linear programming, to determine optimal portfolios of product impact-reduction opportunities under budget constraints. The approach is illustrated through a simulated breakfast cereal manufacturing firm procuring grain, containerboard boxes, plastic packaging, electricity, and industrial cleaning solutions. Results suggest that extending EPP decisions and resources to the portfolio level, recently made feasible through the methods illustrated herein, can provide substantially greater CO2e and water-depletion reductions per dollar spend than a product-by-product approach, creating opportunities for procurement organizations to participate in firm-wide environmental impact reduction targets.",Crossref,0.0,10.1021/acs.est.5b06289,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b06289,2016.0,Environmental Science &amp; Technology,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Optimizing Eco-Efficiency Across the Procurement Portfolio Opens a new window,Optimizing Eco-Efficiency Across the Procurement Portfolio,10.1021/acs.est.5b06289,,Goal 12,0.08492308753658638,True,public procurement; sustainable procurement; sustainable supply chains

Demand for energy in the basin over the past 50 years has been met by a mix of sources, mainly coal, oil, conventional natural gas, nuclear, and hydropower. However, in the last decade there has been a shift towards an increased capacity in renewable energy production and unconventional natural gas. Each energy source has a unique set of social, economic and environmental impacts. Understanding these impacts is imperative for the continued development of the basin energy sector in a way that minimizes negative impacts. In this article, we review trends in energy use in the basin over the past 50 years, while highlighting recent developments in wind-derived electricity and unconventional natural gas. We examine the impacts of energy production and use on other drivers of change in the basin with an emphasis on the energy–water–climate nexus. While focusing on the pivotal role of government policy, we outline three alternative future scenarios for the energy sector in the basin along with their likely impacts. We also present key challenges that the basin may face over the next 50 years as the energy sector develops.

By examining the content of 1,506 re-permission emails sent by 1,396 firms after the introduction of the GDPR, we document that half the firms gamed the system by using persuasion, instead of transparency, to gain data access. We then confirm that this strategy leads to higher opt-in via a field experiment, as being informative and transparent does not help gain consent.

This has raised concerns about conflict of interest, which policy-makers have attempted to address by introducing payment disclosure laws. However, it is unclear if such disclosure has an effect on physician prescription behavior. We use individual-level claims data from a major provider of health insurance in the U.S. and employ a difference-in-differences research design to study the effect of the payment disclosure law introduced in Massachusetts in June 2009. The research design exploits the fact that while physicians operating in Massachusetts were impacted by the legislation, their counterparts in the neighboring states of Connecticut, New York, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island were not. In order to keep the groups of physicians comparable, we restrict our analysis to physicians in the counties that are on the border of these states. We find that the Massachusetts disclosure law resulted in a decline in prescriptions in all three drug classes studied: statins, antidepressants, and antipsychotics.

We present model-free evidence that while high average quality helps in retaining customers, high variability leads to higher termination rates. Apart from these main effects, we use model-free evidence to document the presence of (a) an interaction effect between average service quality and its variability on termination rates, (b) customer learning about service quality over time, and (c) slower rate of learning among households that experience high variability. We postulate a mechanism involving risk aversion and learning, which can induce this interaction effect and test this against several alternative explanations. We show that it is important to consider variability in quality while inferring the impact of improvements to average quality - ignoring the interaction effect between average quality and variability leads 18% to 64% (5% to 31%) overestimation (underestimation) of quality improvement elasticities among high-variability (low-variability) households.

We describe this potential economic benefit as “social dollars.” This paper contributes evidence for the existence and source of social dollars using data from a multi-channel entertainment products retailer that launched a customer community online. We find a significant increase in customer expenditures attributable to customers joining the firm's community. While self-selection is a concern with field data, we are able to rule out multiple alternative explanations. Social dollars persist over the time period observed and arose primarily in the online channel. To assess the source of the social dollar, we hypothesize and test whether it is moderated by participation behaviors conceptually linked to common attributes of customer communities. Our results reveal that posters (vs. lurkers) of community content and those with more (vs. fewer) social ties in the community generated more (fewer) social dollars. We found a null effect for our measure of the informational advantage expected to accrue to products that differentially benefit from content posted by like-minded community members. This overall pattern of results suggests a stronger social than informational source of economic benefits for firm operators of customer communities.

Unfortunately, theory and prior research suggest that deviance is associated with job stressors, which are endemic to work organizations and often cannot be easily eliminated. To address this conundrum, we explore actions individuals can take at work that serve as buffering conditions for the positive relationship between job stressors and deviant behavior. Drawing upon conservation of resources theory, we examine a resource-building activity (i.e., learning something new at work) and a demand-shielding activity (i.e., taking time for relaxation at work) as potential boundary conditions. In 2 studies with employee samples using complementary designs, we find support for the buffering role of learning but not for relaxation. When employees learn new things at work, the relationship between hindrance stressors and deviance is weaker; as is the indirect relationship mediated by negative emotions. Taking time for relaxation at work did not show a moderating role in either study. Therefore, although relaxation is a response that individuals might be inclined to turn to for counteracting work stress, our findings suggest that, when it comes to addressing negative emotions and deviance in stressful work environments, building positive resources by learning something new at work could be more useful. In that way, doing more (i.e., learning, and not relaxing) is associated with less (deviance) in the face of job stressors.

Other clinical measures of health, such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and mortality show no improvement. The diagnosis rates for preventable disease-related conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and kidney disease increase following a diagnosis, likely due to more intensive screening.

Opens a new window","Background
By September 2015, a total of 29 states and Washington, D.C., were participating in Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act. We examined whether Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in insurance coverage, health care use, and health among low-income adults.
Methods
We compared changes in outcomes during the 2 years after implementation of the Medicaid expansion (2014 and 2015) relative to the 4 years before expansion (2010 through 2013) in states with and without expansions, using data from the National Health Interview Survey. The sample consisted of 60,766 U.S. citizens who were 19 to 64 years of age and had incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level. Outcomes included insurance coverage, access to and use of medical care in the past 12 months, and health status as reported by the respondents.
Results
A total of 29 states and Washington, D.C., expanded Medicaid by September 1, 2015. In year 2 after implementation, uninsurance rates were reduced in expansion states relative to nonexpansion states (difference-in-differences estimate, −8.2 percentage points; P<0.001) and rates of Medicaid coverage were increased (difference-in-differences estimate, 15.6 percentage points; P<0.001). Expansions were not associated with significant changes in the likelihood of a doctor visit or overnight hospital stay or health status as reported by the respondent. However, as compared with nonexpansion states, expansion states had a decrease in reports of inability to afford needed follow-up care (difference-in-differences estimate, −3.4 percentage points; P=0.002) and in reports of worry about paying medical bills (difference-in-differences estimate, −7.9 percentage points; P=0.002) and an increase in reports of medical care being delayed because of wait times for appointments (difference-in-differences estimate, 2.6 percentage points; P=0.02).
Conclusions
Medicaid expansion was associated with increased insurance coverage and access to care during the second year of implementation, but it was also associated with longer wait times for appointments, which suggests that challenges in access to care persist.

In 2014, only 26 states and the District of Columbia chose to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions for low-income adults.
Objective:
To evaluate whether the state Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in insurance coverage, access to and utilization of health care, and self-reported health.
Design:
Comparison of outcomes before and after the expansions in states that did and did not expand Medicaid.
Setting:
United States.
Participants:
Citizens aged 19 to 64 years with family incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level in the 2010 to 2014 National Health Interview Surveys.
Measurements:
Health insurance coverage (private, Medicaid, or none); improvements in coverage over the previous year; visits to physicians in general practice and specialists; hospitalizations and emergency department visits; skipped or delayed medical care; usual source of care; diagnoses of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension; self-reported health; and depression.
Results:
In the second half of 2014, adults in expansion states experienced increased health insurance (7.4 percentage points [95% CI, 3.4 to 11.3 percentage points]) and Medicaid (10.5 percentage points [CI, 6.5 to 14.5 percentage points]) coverage and better coverage than 1 year before (7.1 percentage points [CI, 2.7 to 11.5 percentage points]) compared with adults in nonexpansion states. Medicaid expansions were associated with increased visits to physicians in general practice (6.6 percentage points [CI, 1.3 to 12.0 percentage points]), overnight hospital stays (2.4 percentage points [CI, 0.7 to 4.2 percentage points]), and rates of diagnosis of diabetes (5.2 percentage points [CI, 2.4 to 8.1 percentage points]) and high cholesterol (5.7 percentage points [CI, 2.0 to 9.4 percentage points]). Changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant.
Limitation:
Observational study may be susceptible to unmeasured confounders; reliance on self-reported data; limited post-ACA time frame provided information on short-term changes only.
Conclusion:
The ACA Medicaid expansions were associated with higher rates of insurance coverage, improved quality of coverage, increased utilization of some types of health care, and higher rates of diagnosis of chronic health conditions for low-income adults.",Crossref,0.0,10.7326/m15-2234,https://doi.org/10.7326/m15-2234,2016.0,Annals of Internal Medicine,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-title:Early Coverage, Access, Utilization, and Health Effects of the Affordable Care A","Early Coverage, Access, Utilization, and Health Effects Associated With the Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansions",10.7326/m15-2234,,Goal 3,0.09333187189113268,True,health coverage

Much has been achieved since then to reduce disparities and discrimination in financial markets and the corporate world, yet some of these practices persist. Why is that? After almost sixty years of “equal-opportunity statements” inserted in job advertisements across America and other countries, are companies preventing discrimination and aiming to foster diversity? And are lenders seriously addressing the disparities in the supply of credit observed between different racial groups?",Crossref,0.0,10.1093/rcfs/cfac022,https://doi.org/10.1093/rcfs/cfac022,2022.0,The Review of Corporate Finance Studies,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-title:Discrimination, Disparities, and Diversity in Finance (Foreword by RCFS Editors ","Discrimination, Disparities, and Diversity in Finance",10.1093/rcfs/cfac022,,Goal 10,0.05776640216636739,True,discrimination; eliminating discrimination

Opens a new window","Cause marketing (CM) typically involves for-profit firms donating part of their sales revenue to a charity, with the hope that this will increase their revenue. We argue that it is important for a regulator to monitor firms’ CM activities, and to assess how differences in the enforcement of CM laws impact the CM practice by firms. Our analytical model uses a Stackelberg leader–follower game that endogenizes the regulator’s decision to enforce CM. The firm then decides whether to truthfully declare or overstate the amount it contributes to charity (and if overstate: by how much). We find the following results in equilibrium under different conditions: (i) CM campaigns are a win–win–win situation – they increase profit for the firm while being truthful, generate larger donations for the charity, and generate a cause marketing surplus for the regulator, resulting in doing well while doing good, (ii) the best response of the firm is to be strategic, even when the regulator is strict with monitoring, (iii) the regulator itself decides not to monitor CM, even though it knows that this results in untruthful behavior by firms. When we endogenize the extent of overstatement, we find that the firm tends to be strategic by overstating donation percentage, whether the regulator is strict or not. As the proportion of unsophisticated consumers (who believe a firm’s claims, whether truthful or not) increases, the donation proportion decreases in general, and the overstatement level increases when the regulator is lenient and decreases when the regulator is strict. In equilibrium, the regulator is strict if the market size is large, and lenient otherwise. A survey with consumers supports key modeling assumptions regarding consumers' lack of knowledge of CM laws.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.01.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.01.003,2022.0,International Journal of Research in Marketing,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:How does regulatory monitoring of cause marketing affect firm behavior and donat,How does regulatory monitoring of cause marketing affect firm behavior and donations to charity?,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.01.003,,Goal 16,0.005837100734736915,False,

Opens a new window","Statistical default models, widely used to assess default risk, are subject to a Lucas critique. We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997--2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. The change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk may therefore be undermined by the actions of market participants.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.1296982,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1296982,2010.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-title:The Failure of Models that Predict Failure: Distance, Incentives and Defaults Op","The Failure of Models that Predict Failure: Distance, Incentives and Defaults",10.2139/ssrn.1296982,,Goal 17,0.01847985660974201,False,

An Interactional Creation Framework and Implications for Value Creation,"The “co-creation” label has proliferated over the past decade. With little consensus on what “co-creation” is, we offer a novel, unifying perspective by anchoring its theorization in creation through interactions. We develop a definition of co-creation as enactment of interactional creation across interactive system-environments (afforded by interactive platforms) entailing agencing engagements and structuring organizations. Interactional creation is enacted by means of interactions of “agencial assemblages”, while agencing engagements and structuring organizations enable and constrain interactions. Interactive platforms, i.e., instantiations of agencial assemblages, are composed of heterogeneous relations of artifacts, processes, interfaces, and persons. Aided by digitalized technologies, interactive platforms afford a multiplicity of interactive system-environments that connect creational interactions with how experienced outcomes emerge from their underlying resourced capabilities. We apply our definitional framework to the practice of value creation as a co-creation, cutting across conventional “production”, “exchange”, and “use” activities.

Opens a new window","Rapid increases in oil prices in 2008 led some to call for special taxes on the oil industry. Because oil is an exhaustible resource, however, the effects of excise taxes on production or on reported producer profits may be more complex than in many other markets. This paper uses well-level production data on California oil wells for the period 1977-2008, along with the rich variation in producer prices induced by federal oil taxes and pre-1980 price controls, to estimate how temporary taxes affect oil production decisions. Theory suggests that temporary taxes could lead producers to shut wells, and more generally that they create strong incentives for retiming production to minimize tax burdens. The empirical estimates suggest small estimates of extensive responses to after-tax prices, meaning that wells are rarely shut, but they also suggest substantial retiming of production for operating wells. While the estimates vary with specifications, the elasticity of oil production with respect to the after-tax price is estimated to fall between 0.208 and 0.261. The estimates are used to calibrate a simple model of the efficiency cost of tax-induced distortions relative to the no-tax optimal extraction path. These calculations suggest that a 15 percent temporary excise tax on California oil producers reduces the present value of producer surplus by between one and five percent of the no-tax surplus or between 113 and 166 percent of the government revenue raised, depending on the original life of the well and the duration of the temporary tax.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.2211681,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2211681,2013.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Taxation and the Extraction of Exhaustible Resources: Evidence from California O,Taxes and the Extraction of Exhaustible Resources: Evidence from California Oil Production,10.2139/ssrn.2211681,,Goal 12,0.02824979784844836,False,

We show that this relationship does not hold if the variation is restricted to within-firm only. Our null results suggest a relatively precise zero estimate for the mean firm. Next we investigate heterogeneity in the relationship between dividends and investment.

Opens a new window","This paper examines the impact of the R&D tax credit between 1981-1991 using confidential IRS data from corporate tax returns. The key advances on previous work are an instrumental variables strategy based on tax law changes that addresses the simultaneity between R&D spending and its user cost and the use of new confidential data. Estimates imply that a ten percent reduction in the user cost of R&D leads the average firm to increase its research intensity -- the ratio of R&D spending to sales -- by 11 percent in the short-run. Long-run estimates imply that firms do face adjustment costs and further increase spending over the longer-run. Analysis of the components of qualified research shows that wages and supplies account for the bulk of the increase in research spending. Comparisons of the elasticity across firms of different sizes, industries, tax status, multi-national status and credit history are also made. Neither small nor young firms appear more responsive in the static analysis but the dynamic model reveals stronger short-run responses, suggesting that they may face lower adjustment costs or liquidity constraints in financing R&D. Long-run and re-timing analyses show no evidence that firms allocate their qualified research spending over time to maximize their R&D tax credits. Elasticities of qualified and total research intensities from a smaller sample suggest firms respond to user cost changes largely by increasing their qualified spending, meaning that what R&D the federal credit deems qualified research is an important margin on which the credit affects firm behavior.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.2272174,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2272174,2013.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Do Tax Credits Stimulate R&D Spending?

The analysis presented here is observational, not causal, as it examines how the business activities of firms that chose to invert changed after expatriation. In addition to statistically assessing the equity market’s reaction to inversion announcements, this paper examines how firms alter their patterns of employment and investment after inversion. In particular, the paper follows how the foreign shares of an inverting firm’s employment and investment change following inversion, relative to comparable non-inverting firms. The behavior of inverting firms following expatriation is assessed going back to 1980 as well as only after the 2004 policy change, which made expatriation through merger with a foreign firm with substantive foreign business activities more attractive. The results suggest that inverting firms have higher shares of the employees and capital expenditures located abroad after inversion relative to changes experienced by similar non-inverting firms. Further, these increases are not attributable to one-time changes due to the inclusion of a new foreign partner’s existing workforce and ongoing investments; foreign shares of employment and investment are higher two and more years after inversion relative to the first year just after inversion when any one-time increases would register.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.2566429,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2566429,2015.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Corporate Inversions and Economic Performance Opens a new window,Corporate Inversions and Economic Performance,10.2139/ssrn.2566429,,Goal 8,0.04703083972294307,False,

Opens a new window","Emotional intelligence (EI) has captivated researchers and the public alike, but it has been challenging to establish its components as objective abilities. Self-report scales lack divergent validity from personality traits, and few ability tests have objectively correct answers. We adapt the Stroop task to introduce a new facet of EI called emotional attention regulation (EAR), which involves focusing emotion-related attention for the sake of information processing rather than for the sake of regulating one’s own internal state. EAR includes 2 distinct components. First, tuning in to nonverbal cues involves identifying nonverbal cues while ignoring alternate content, that is, emotion recognition under conditions of distraction by competing stimuli. Second, tuning out of nonverbal cues involves ignoring nonverbal cues while identifying alternate content, that is, the ability to interrupt emotion recognition when needed to focus attention elsewhere. An auditory test of valence included positive and negative words spoken in positive and negative vocal tones. A visual test of approach–avoidance included green- and red-colored facial expressions depicting happiness and anger. The error rates for incongruent trials met the key criteria for establishing the validity of an EI test, in that the measure demonstrated test–retest reliability, convergent validity with other EI measures, divergent validity from factors such as general processing speed and mostly personality, and predictive validity in this case for well-being. By demonstrating that facets of EI can be validly theorized and empirically assessed, results also speak to the validity of EI more generally.

This literature, tracing back to Le Bon's seminal work on crowd psychology, has established the veracity of collective affect and demonstrated its influence on a wide range of group dynamics. More recently, an interest in the perception of collective affect has emerged, revealing a need for a methodological approach for assessing collective emotion recognition to complement measures of individual emotion recognition. This article addresses this need by introducing the Emotional Aperture Measure (EAM). Three studies provide evidence that collective affect recognition requires a processing style distinct from individual emotion recognition and establishes the validity and reliability of the EAM. A sample of working managers further shows how the EAM provides unique insights into how individuals interact with collectives. We discuss how the EAM can advance several lines of research on collective affect.",Crossref,0.0,10.1037/t46854-000,https://doi.org/10.1037/t46854-000,2016.0,PsycTESTS Dataset,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Assessing Collective Affect Recognition via the Emotional Aperture Measure Opens,Emotional Aperture Measure,10.1037/t46854-000,,Goal 8,0.004176401169935888,False,

Drawing on Emotions as Social Information theory, we propose that observers use team members’ emotional displays as a source of information to predict the team's trajectory. We argue and show that displays of sadness elicit more pessimistic inferences regarding team dynamics (e.g., trust, satisfaction, team effectiveness, conflict) compared to displays of happiness. Moreover, we find that this effect is strengthened when the future interaction between the team members is more ambiguous (i.e., under ethnic dissimilarity; Study 1) and when emotional displays can be clearly linked to the team members’ collective experience (Study 2).

Opens a new window","Both scholarly literature and popular accounts suggest that modern organizational practices have moved toward encouraging employees to “integrate” or blur the boundary between their personal and professional domains, for example, through self-disclosure at work, company-sponsored social activities or providing on-site child care. Concurrently, an ideology underlying U.S. professional norms discourages integration practices such as referencing non-work roles during workplace interactions, expressing emotions in the workplace, and/or displaying non-work-related items in workspaces. In this review, we posit that these two norms firmly coexist because they differentially serve two objectives corresponding to the parallel bodies of research we examine: one addressing boundary management as a tool for handling role responsibilities, and the other considering boundary management as a tool for shaping workplace identity and relationships. Specifically, we posit that segmenting personal and professional domains facilitates the management of role responsibilities, whereas integration is more beneficial for managing workplace identity and relationships.

Women, who were already at a significant disadvantage in corporate America prior to the movement now face increased exclusion by men in and outside the workplace. Worse yet, the harsh reaction to the movement may have caused men to become more skeptical of sexual harassment claims.

One of the responses to the movement is an outpouring of literature, both academic and popular, centering on the difficulties women face in obtaining mentors, sponsors, and other forms of advocacy in the post-#MeToo era. Many articles focus on the need for men to take an active role in using their privilege and position to assist women in breaking these barriers. Although the importance of mentoring women cannot be overstated, and the emphasis on men mentoring women is critical given the gender inequality among senior management, largely absent from the analysis is a discussion of the benefits that women, men, and society as a whole receive when women mentor men.

This manuscript explores this perspective, arguing that there should be a focus on providing opportunities for women to mentor men. It posits that women mentoring men may be essential for ultimately bridging the divide between the genders and helping to eliminate gender bias in corporate America. In addition, it addresses how the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates a need for female mentorship and provides an opportunity to redefine the mentoring relationship.

1acdf3582defcc6ddb998e314624cd9213b300ac,Cindy Schipani,The Role of Gender Diversity in Corporate Governance,"A number of studies show that companies with more women involved in leadership positions tend to outperform their sector in terms of return on equity, operating result, and stock price growth. A diverse board may signal independence, creative thought, opportunities for breakout strategies and an open-mindedness on the part of the company -- traits that are increasingly important as external factors such as globalization and heightened competitiveness impact the marketplace. Having women in key positions may add value through women’s distinctive set of skills, and creating cultures of inclusion through a diverse workforce.

This paper begins with a review of studies analyzing gender diversity and firm performance, followed with an analysis of role incongruity and gender inequality in the workplace. The paper continues with examination of the multitude of revelations concerning egregious incidents of sexual harassment, which may go a long way toward explaining the apparent barriers present for women pursuing pathways to positions of organizational leadership. We then offer our proposals for potential solutions involving changing company norms.

f6da6b8c646e6febffca833ce164ff6ba160a9f5,Cindy Schipani,"Eliminating Conflicts of Interests in Banks: The Significance of the Volcker Rule 
Opens a new window","The gradual weakening and subsequent repeal of most provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed commercial banks to acquire investment banking subsidiaries, to grow substantially in size, and to access even more information through more diverse banking activities. At the same time, proprietary trading became a major source of revenue for the banks.

The subsequent financial crisis of 2008 exposed another glaring weakness of banking in the post-Glass-Steagall era. Banks had grown too big, too risky and too interconnected, many surpassing trillions of dollars in assets, interbank loans and liabilities on and off balance sheet. The sheer size, risk and interconnectedness of banking alone raised concerns about systemically important and too-big-to-fail banks. After numerous attempts to bring back Glass-Steagall failed, Congress attempted to contain banking systemic banking risk by passing the Volcker rule to prohibit proprietary trading, and enacting consumer protection and other ring-fencing and fire-wall provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act.

To test the potential importance of the Volcker Rule, we would need to know the amount of profits banks make from using proprietary adverse information about their clients. However, the source of the proprietary information banks use to execute their proprietary trading programs is typically confidential. Furthermore, banks do not disclose where and how they obtain this confidential information, which helps them create billions of dollars of profits every year.

In this paper we investigate one possible source of this information. Specifically, we investigate the importance of the private information banks acquire as part of their financial intermediary and financial advisory role for their client firms. Banks often attain insider trading status and become subject to insider trading reporting requirements and trading restrictions when they are hired to provide financial advice to their client firms. When banks become temporary insiders, they must also report all of these trades executed on Forms 3, 4, and 5 alongside other legal insiders.

Using this insider trading database, we demonstrate that banks can and do access important, private, material information about their clients and trade on this information. On average, the inside information that banks acquire and trade on is highly valuable, allowing the banks to earn more on 25% on their proprietary trades. Furthermore, we find that relaxation and elimination of the Glass-Steagall restrictions allowed the banks to trade more frequently and earn greater amount of abnormal profits. Since 2002, banks tend to trade and earn more than 40% abnormal profits from adverse information about their client firms. Consequently, we demonstrate that an added benefit of enforcement of the Volcker Rule would be to eliminate the incentives to trade on material, non-public information about their clients by eliminating proprietary trading by banks. Thus, we argue that enforcing the Volcker Rule would also help contain some the current conflicts of interest in the banking system resulting from the elimination of Glass-Steagall restrictions.

Although Title VII and accompanying legislation and judicial rulings have made significant headway in improving the work environment for women, pathways for women to positions of leadership in organizations are still generally elusive. Our studies suggest additional challenges for women with dependents. In light of the overwhelming evidence that leadership opportunities are effectively denied to a large number of female citizens, it is time to reinterpret Title VII in a way to help remedy this type of discrimination.

We thus advocate three proposals for reform. First, recognizing that quotas would be difficult to implement in the United States, we argue that in cases alleging gender discrimination, courts consider the paucity of women in leadership positions as a rebuttable presumption of discrimination – as a logical extension to the disparate impact analysis firmly established in precedent. Second, we implore the SEC to define diversity, in reports already required of public companies, to include gender diversity.

However, studies also show that many employees do not feel safe speaking up and often choose to remain silent about the issues or problems they encounter at work. We argue that providing employees with voice opportunities is not only likely to have positive effects inside organizations but is also likely to be essential in building positive organizations that contribute to the development of human potential in our communities and societies.

As time goes by, however, the interests of the parties may diverge. It is in the franchisees’ interest to make their individual units as profitable as possible while, conversely, franchisors also profit from the licensing of the trademark and the collection of royalties from all their franchisees. For example, an increase in the number of stores in a given market will likely benefit the franchisor, whereas the same expansion may dilute the profitability of a particular franchisee through encroachment. The parties’ interests, thus, become misaligned.

We argue that that, in addition to increased disclosure under Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules, the misalignments in the franchisor-franchisee relationship can be addressed by taking a more self-regulatory approach that recasts the duties owed among the parties. The FTC regulations focus on greater disclosure and as government regulations the rules are aimed at external incentives and protecting of the party that is perceived as having less leverage and (i.e., the franchisee). We argue for a more fiduciary duty-like relationship for franchisor-franchisee relationship and look at two somewhat related ways that the relationship is “self-regulated” by the market and, thus, the parties. We first examine the time-tested mechanism of fiduciary duties imposed by the courts as an additional balancing mechanism to supplement the mere disclosure under the FTC. Second, we examine the equitable standards applied to restrictive covenants, such as non-compete agreements and non-disclosure (confidentiality) agreements as a further reference point for how the common law can provide guidance on the boundaries of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. We conclude that this mix of court intervention to impose fiduciary duties and the existing FTC regulation is sensible because the parties are in a relatively long-term, well-defined relationship in which the initial disclosure under the FTC rules is insufficient.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.2467524,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2467524,2014.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:A Corporate Governance Perspective on the Franchisor-Franchisee Relationship,A Corporate Governance Perspective on the Franchisor-Franchisee Relationship,10.2139/ssrn.2467524,,Goal 17,0.01810141422496043,False,

Opens a new window","Objective
To assess the relationship between sleep quality and occupational well-being in active duty military Service Members.
Design
Longitudinal prospective analysis.
Setting
An annual military training event.
Participants
US Army special operations Soldiers (n = 60; 100% male; age 25.41 ± 3.74).
Intervention
None.
Measurements
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered prior to the training event, and the Emotional Exhaustion Scale, the Role Overload Scale, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Soldier-Specific Functional Impairment Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered after the event. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between sleep and occupational wellness measures, and the outcome measures of “good” and “poor” sleepers (per the PSQI scoring criteria) were compared with Student's t tests.
Results
Higher (poorer) PSQI Global Scores predicted poorer occupational wellness of all measures (emotional exhaustion: B = 1.60, P < .001, R2 = 0.25; functional impairment: B = 0.29, P = .03, R2 = 0.14; role overload: B = 0.28, P = .008, R2 = 0.12; and perceived stress: B = 0.34, P = .004, R2 = 0.20). There were additional relationships between specific PSQI component scores and occupational wellness measures, which is a replication of This team's previous work. Furthermore, emotional exhaustion (t(58) = −4.18, P < .001), functional impairment (t(59)= −3.68, P = .001), role overload (t(58) = −3.20, P = .002), and perceived stress (t(58) = −2.43, P = .02) were all higher in poor sleepers.
Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest that US Army special operations Soldiers who have poorer sleep quality may be at increased risk for having poorer occupational well-being.

Opens a new window","Objectives
Explore the impact transitioning from daytime to nighttime operations has on performance in U.S. Army Rangers.
Methods
Fifty-four male Rangers (age 26.1±4.0 years) completed the Y-Balance Test (YBT), a vertical jump assessment, and a grip strength test at three time points. Baseline testing occurred while the Rangers were on daytime operations; post-test occurred after the first night into the nighttime operation training (after full night of sleep loss), and follow-up testing occurred six days later (end of nighttime training).
Results
On the YBT, performance was significantly worse at post-test compared to baseline during right posteromedial reach (104.1±7.2cm vs 106.5±6.7cm, p=.014), left posteromedial reach (105.4±7.5cm vs 108.5±6.6cm, p=.003), right composite score (274.8±19.3cm vs 279.7±18.1cm, p=.043), left composite score (277.9±18.1cm vs 283.3±16.7cm, p=.016), and leg asymmetry was significantly worse in the posterolateral direction (4.8±4.0cm vs 3.7±3.1cm, p=.030) and the anterior direction (5.0±4.0cm vs 3.6±2.6cm, p=.040). The average vertical jump height was significantly lower at post-test compared to baseline (20.6±3.4 in vs 21.8±3.0 in, p=.004). Baseline performance on YBT and vertical jump did not differ from follow-up.
Conclusions
Army Rangers experienced an immediate, but temporary, drop in dynamic balance and vertical jump performance when transitioning from daytime to nighttime operations. When feasible, Rangers should consider adjusting their sleep cycles prior to anticipating nighttime operations in order to maintain their performance levels. Investigating strategies that may limit impairments during this transition is warranted.

Opens a new window","Background and objectives
Job crafting is proactively adjusting and redesigning one's own job to make it more meaningful. This is accomplished by changing the activities (task crafting), altering the way one thinks about the job (cognitive crafting), and using discretion about with whom one chooses to work (relational crafting). We examined self-reported behavioral manifestations of job crafting among Ontario registered nurses working in public health.
Research design and methods
This qualitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with registered nurses (n = 238) from six randomly selected health regions in Ontario, Canada. Registered nurses completed surveys to provide quantitative ratings and qualitative reports of their job crafting behaviours. Data analyses included descriptive statistics and a content analysis of written comments to summarize common job crafting behaviours.
Results
Registered nurses in public health are actively job crafting by emphasizing and initiating tasks that are based on strengths and passions. Examples included training students and new staff, participating in workgroups and committees, and being involved in projects. Nurses proactively modified the processes of the tasks to better meet client needs and improve quality of care. Job crafting facilitators and barriers included availability of opportunities, support from management, experience/level of skill of the nurse, limitations in the role, and heavy workload/insufficient staffing. The ability to continually modify tasks at the point of care, using evidenced-based approaches and utilizing education and professional development facilitated job crafting. Nurses reported that improving work meaningfulness was a driver of job crafting. Nurses also described a willingness to take on other tasks, being enriched by nurse-client and collegial relationships, and that their service to clients superseded their service to the organization.
Discussion and implications
Public health registered nurses are actively involved in their own, bottom-up job redesign and managers are instrumental in facilitating or hindering the job crafting process. Managers can support nurses by allowing them to make changes on the job, providing professional development, managing workload and creating environments that support collegial relationships. Overall, the study contributes new knowledge about job crafting. It draws attention to the importance of registered nurses' involvement in designing their jobs. Lastly, managers and educators should promote and support job crafting.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.apnr.2021.151556,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2021.151556,2022.0,Applied Nursing Research,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Job crafting in registered nurses working in public health: A qualitative study.,Job crafting in registered nurses working in public health: A qualitative study,10.1016/j.apnr.2021.151556,,Goal 3,0.04036836447201197,False,

Study 1b, conducted in a large consulting company in India, extends these findings with a field experiment in which co-workers rated the prosocial behavior of teammates in a round robin design. Moving from devoting time to devoting money, in Studies 2a and 2b we find that individuals randomly assigned to engage in a focused breathing meditation were more financially generous. To understand the mechanisms of mindfulness’ effects on prosocial behavior, Study 3 found support for empathy and moderate support for perspective taking as mediators. This study also examined the effects of induced state mindfulness via two different mindfulness inductions, focused breathing and loving kindness meditation.

The objectives of this study is to examine the effect of leader sleep devaluation (which we define as leader behaviors that signal to employees that sleep should be sacrificed for work) on the sleep and unethical behavior of subordinates.
Design
Across 2 studies (with 3 total samples of participants), we use a cross-sectional survey, a diary study completed by employees, and a diary study completed by employees and their leaders.
Setting
Study 1 – a convenience sample of working adults in Italy, including 575 subordinates nested under 140 leaders. Study 2A – 135 working adults recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Study 2B – 127 employee-supervisor dyads recruited from the Study Response project.
Measurements
Survey measures of leader behaviors, subordinates sleep, and subordinate unethical behavior.
Results
Sleep devaluing leader behavior has harmful effects on employee sleep, and that these effects occur above and beyond the effects of abusive supervision and other alternative explanations. Subordinate sleep quality has a mediating role between leader sleep devaluation and subordinate unethical behavior. Effects for sleep quantity were inconsistent.
Conclusions
Leaders can adversely influence the sleep and work experience of their subordinates. Specifically, sleep devaluing leader behavior undermines subordinate sleep, which in turn is associated with higher levels of subordinate unethical behavior.

However, contrary to the expectation that firms respond to softening demand by lowering prices, newspapers increased subscription prices by 40-60% during this period. In this paper, we explain and quantify the factors responsible for these price increases. We calibrate models of readership and advertising demand using data from a top-50 U.S. regional print newspaper. Conditional on these demand models, we calibrate the newspaper’s optimal pricing equations, and assess whether the increase in subscription prices are mainly rationalized by: a) the decline in readers’ willingness to pay (WTP) in the presence of heterogeneity among subscribers, or b) the newspaper’s reduced incentive to subsidize readers at the expense of advertisers, due to softening demand for newspaper advertising. We find that the decline in the ability of the newspaper to subsidize readers by extracting surplus from advertisers explains most of the increase in subscription prices. Of the three available subscription options (Daily, Weekend, and Sunday only), subscription prices increased more steeply for the Daily option, a pattern consistent with the view that newspapers are driving away low valuation weekday readers while preserving Sunday readership and the corresponding ad revenues. Thus, our research augments theoretical propositions in two-sided markets by providing a formal empirical approach to unraveling the relative importance of the role played by agents on the subsidy and demand side in determining prices.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.2885476,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2885476,2016.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Rising Prices under Declining Preferences: The Case of the U.S. Print Newspaper ,Rising Prices under Declining Preferences: The Case of the U.S. Print Newspaper Industry,10.2139/ssrn.2885476,,Goal 1,0.00805190320822711,False,

Between 2006 and 2010, the industry lost approximately 51% in print advertising revenues. The concomitant increase in the less rewarding online advertising has been unable to make up for this loss. As a result, in 2010, for every $1 increase in online advertising, newspapers lost $7 in print advertising. A prevalent concern is that online newspaper advertising is cannibalizing the more lucrative print advertising. We investigate the veracity of this claim by studying how firms reallocate their media budgets over time between the online and print media within the newspaper as well as other media options outside the newspaper. We perform our empirical analysis using unique panel data on account-level advertising expenditures in a Top 50 US newspaper during a 60-month period from January 2007 through December 2011. We find that advertisers view print and online advertising within the same newspaper as substitutes. However, across a wide range of specifications, only 4-9% of the decline in print advertising can be traced back to the growing attractiveness of the online newspaper. Thus, concerns in the industry that newspapers’ websites are responsible for the decline in print advertising may not be valid. Most of the decline in print advertising revenues is due to the growth in attractiveness of outside media options. Based on these results, we infer the monetary impact that the growing attractiveness of online newspaper advertising has had on the overall newspaper ad revenues.

We present model-free evidence that while high average quality helps in retaining customers, high variability leads to higher termination rates. Apart from these main effects, we use model-free evidence to document the presence of (a) an interaction effect between average service quality and its variability on termination rates, (b) customer learning about service quality over time, and (c) slower rate of learning among households that experience high variability. We postulate a mechanism involving risk aversion and learning, which can induce this interaction effect and test this against several alternative explanations. We show that it is important to consider variability in quality while inferring the impact of improvements to average quality - ignoring the interaction effect between average quality and variability leads 18% to 64% (5% to 31%) overestimation (underestimation) of quality improvement elasticities among high-variability (low-variability) households.

46135f75cd833c980f98fba66350bef09a2de6a5,Will Thomas,"Branding Corporate Criminals 
Opens a new window","Corporate punishment has a branding problem. Criminal sanctions should call out wrongdoing and condemn wrongdoers. In a world where generic corporate misconduct is a daily affair, conviction singles out truly contemptible practices from merely sharp, unproductive, or undesirable ones. In this way, criminal law gives victims the recognition they deserve, deters future wrongdoers who want to preserve their good name, and publicly reinforces society’s most treasured values.

Unfortunately, corporate punishment falls far short of all these communicative ambitions. For punishment to convey its intended message, society must be able to hear it. When courts convict individuals, everyone understands that the conviction places a mark of enduring stigma: “felon,” “thief,” “murderer,” and “fraudster.” The state reinforces this impression by reserving its harshest and most degrading treatment for individual criminals, caging them and possibly killing them. Corporate punishment, by contrast, is a fleeting affair diluted by civil and administrative alternatives, PR spin, and a frenetic media environment. In today’s criminal justice system, it can be hard even to identify after the fact who the corporate criminals are. Unsurprisingly, corporations view criminal charges as inconvenient economic uncertainties and criminal fines as mere costs of doing business. Public perceptions have largely followed suit.

Corporate criminal law could disrupt this perverse dynamic by adopting a new sanction that would “brand” corporate criminals. While the brand sanction could take many forms—different visual marks of varying size—this Article calls for, at a minimum, appending a criminal designation, ⓕ, to corporate felons’ legal name and mandating its appearance on products and communications. This “corporate criminal brand” would stand as a 21st century corporate reimagining of its medieval corporal punishment namesake. Lawmakers rightly rejected physical brands on individual criminals long ago. The criminal justice landscape is different for corporations, who feel no pain and have no dignity. Unlike monetary fines, corporate criminal branding would unambiguously signal a corporation’s criminal status to outside observers. By forcibly integrating corporations’ criminal identity into their public image, criminal law might finally have a way to recognize victims and to strike at what corporations value most.

Determinants and consequences of social distancing from journalists who engage in negative coverage of firm leadership.,"We consider how social and psychological connections among CEOs explain the propensity for corporate leaders to distance themselves socially from journalists who engage in negative reporting about firm leadership at other companies, and we examine the consequences for the valence of journalists’ subsequent coverage. Our theoretical framework suggests that journalists who have engaged in negative coverage of a firm’s leadership and strategy are especially likely to experience distancing from other leaders who (a) have friendship ties to the firm’s CEO, (b) are demographically similar to the CEO on salient dimensions, or (c) are socially identified with the CEO as a fellow member of the corporate elite. Our theory and findings ultimately suggest that, due to the multiple sources of social identification between CEOs, journalists who engage in negative coverage of firm leadership tend to experience social distancing from multiple CEOs, and that such distancing has a powerful influence on the valence of journalists’ subsequent reporting about firm leadership and strategy across all the firms they cover.

Our theoretical argument suggests that in anticipation of social interaction with a relatively high-status colleague, corporate directors tend to reflect on characteristics shared with that colleague, while avoiding thoughts about characteristics not shared. We explain how this pattern of cognition induces genuine positive feelings and admiration for the colleague, such that their interpersonal behaviors are less likely to appear as insincere attempts to curry favor, and thus more likely to engender influence. We further suggest that this pattern of cognition is especially valuable when interacting with relatively high-status colleagues who are demographically dissimilar from the focal actor. Finally, our theoretical framework indicates how this self-regulated cognition facilitates advancement in the corporate elite by positively moderating the effects of one’s interpersonal behavior on the likelihood that colleagues will recommend him or her for a board appointment.

We also find that during the pre-OGI period lead arrangers retain a lower loan share when a loan is issued following bad inspection outcomes compared to clean inspection outcomes. This effect is stronger when lead arrangers are more likely to be informed (as measured by their prior experience submitting Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FDA and a higher inspection materiality) and when syndicate participants are less likely to be informed (as measured by the lack of their prior FDA FOIA requests, lead arranger experience, and the lack of borrowers’ voluntary disclosure of inspection outcomes).

We also show that borrowers that obtain loans from nonrelationship lead arrangers in the post-CDS trading initiation period are more opaque, in line with the effect of CDSs being more pronounced for borrowers for which adverse selection costs are higher. Further analyses show that, relative to relationship lead arrangers, nonrelationship lead arrangers have lower monitoring incentives in the post-period, as reflected by less restrictive covenants and performance pricing provisions they impose and by the reduced loan shares they retain. Moreover, we find that borrowers of nonrelationship lead arrangers following CDS trading initiation have higher growth opportunities and more volatile operations, consistent with such borrowers benefiting more from weaker restrictions on their activities imposed by lenders. Lastly, lower monitoring incentives of CDS-protected nonrelationship lead arrangers also decrease the propensity of inexperienced participants to join their syndicates.

In syndicated loan deals, information asymmetries can exist between lenders that have a relationship with a borrower and less informed, nonrelationship lenders competing to serve as lead arranger on a syndicated loan, and also between lead arrangers and less informed syndicate participants. Theory suggests that the aggressiveness with which less informed lenders compete for a loan deal increases in the sentiment of public information signals about a borrower. We extend this theory to syndicated loans and hypothesize that the likelihood of less informed lenders serving as the lead arranger or joining a loan syndicate is increasing in the sentiment of media-initiated, borrower-specific articles published prior to loan origination. We find that as media sentiment increases (1) outside, nonrelationship lenders have a higher probability of originating loans; (2) syndicate participants are less likely to have a previous relationship with the borrower or lead bank; (3) lead banks retain a lower percentage of loans; and (4) loan spreads decrease.",Crossref,0.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12131,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12131,2016.0,Journal of Accounting Research,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:The Informational Role of the Media in Private Lending,The Informational Role of the Media in Private Lending,10.1111/1475-679x.12131,,Goal 16,0.004050944837405242,False,

Boasting in the presence of low trust cues activates heightened vigilance (e.g., valenced thoughts) about the source’s motives, leading to decreased persuasion.

We study the price effect of price ceiling policies by exploiting a major policy shift in China: the elimination of longstanding ceilings on retail drug prices. We collect weekly price and characteristics data on more than 4,500 drug stock keeping units (SKUs) from a leading pharmacy chain. By comparing the rate of discontinuous price jumps across drugs with and without price ceilings during the years before and after the policy change, we find that while price ceilings are effective in containing the prices of some drugs, they can lead to higher prices for others, particularly if the ceilings are set at the national level irrespective of local economic conditions. About 5% of nationally controlled drugs (or more than 125 drugs) had inflated prices because of price ceilings, with an average price inflation of 10%. We attribute this perverse price effect to focal point pricing and asymmetric information about production costs. Further supporting this view, we find the perverse price effect most prominent in lower-income regions where the centrally set price ceilings are arbitrarily high considering their poorer economic conditions. Moreover, drugs with highly concentrated production and less elastic demand face heightened risks of inflated prices under price ceilings. Finally, based on a sample of drugs with available price ceiling data, we find that drugs with manufacturer-specific ceilings are 100% more likely to be priced at or near their ceilings and 70% more likely to experience price drops once the ceilings are removed compared with other drugs with regular ceilings. Overall, this paper documents the unintended perverse effect of price ceilings in pharmaceutical markets and sheds lights on the ongoing debate of drug price regulation.",Crossref,0.0,10.2139/ssrn.3252607,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3252607,2018.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Intended and Unintended Consequences of Drug Price Regulations,Intended and Unintended Consequences of Drug Price Regulations,10.2139/ssrn.3252607,,Goal 10,0.02046263824039175,False,

We find that while diversifying entrants generally have superior initial performance, they are also limited in their ability to adapt to new markets, and only retain their advantage over time if they come from highly related markets and can realize strong economies of scope.

Abbott describes life in a “flat,” two-dimensional world that is populated by geometric shapes—squares, lines, triangles, and the like. The inhabitants of Flatland have no consciousness or sense of anything outside the dimensions of their world. Therefore, if a (three-dimensional) sphere were to pass through Flatland, a square observing the event would not see the moving sphere, but rather see something radically different. At first, when the sphere were to touch Flatland, the square would see a point; then, as the sphere were to cut through the plain, the point would become a growing line (which the square could perhaps infer to be a circle with increasing diameter); at some point, the line would become smaller again, until it became a point and then was gone. In other words, the square would experience an object appearing mysteriously from nowhere, changing its shape dramatically, and disappearing again. If the square could lift itself into the third dimension, its perception of the world would change dramatically. For instance, what the square had perceived as growth and contraction in time is just motion in space when seen from the sphere’s perspective—in a sense, a much simpler process.",Crossref,0.0,10.1007/s41469-022-00118-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41469-022-00118-6,2022.0,Journal of Organization Design,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:The Many Dimensions of Research on Designing Flat Firms,The many dimensions of research on designing flat firms,10.1007/s41469-022-00118-6,,Goal 1,0.00882127619392643,False,

The varied effects of social and cultural factors on older consumers can be explained by the changes in the economic status, cognitive functions, and socioemotional needs that consumers experience as they age. We conclude the review by highlighting areas of research that require further investigation.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101740,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101740,2024.0,Current Opinion in Psychology,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Social and cultural influences on older consumers,Social and cultural influences on older consumers,10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101740,,Goal 1,0.03193808527590623,False,

However, a critical challenge that undermines the utility of digital interventions is the suboptimal engagement of participants, where participant engagement is defined as the investment of physical, cognitive, and affective energies in a focal stimulus or task. Recent years have seen substantial growth in research aiming to understand how to increase engagement with digital interventions. This paper highlights several limitations of the existing evidence that restrict its scientific and practical utility and discusses opportunities for advancing the science of engagement with digital interventions. Synthesizing the current body of evidence, we call for conceptualizing digital interventions as a collection of stimuli (e.g., notifications, reminders) and tasks (e.g., open the mobile app, practice a relaxation technique) and considering engagement with digital interventions as a process rather than a state (i.e., momentary conditions/experiences) or trait (i.e., a relatively stable disposition). This approach has the potential to enhance scientific rigor and transparency in measuring, reporting, and interpreting engagement with digital interventions that would ultimately serve to bolster progress towards developing strategies for optimizing engagement.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68067-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68067-7,2024.0,The Lancet,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Towards the science of engagement with digital interventions,Towards a science of community engagement,10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68067-7,,Goal 9,0.02843861200268045,False,

Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. nonanthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces (1) the need to exaggerate the number of one’s current social connections, (2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and (3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.",Crossref,0.0,10.1093/jcr/ucx038,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucx038,2017.0,Journal of Consumer Research,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Products as Pals: Engaging with Anthropomorphic Products Mitigates the Effects o,Products as Pals: Engaging with Anthropomorphic Products Mitigates the Effects of Social Exclusion,10.1093/jcr/ucx038,,Goal 1,0.05952738321066647,True,social exclusion

We note that the taxonomy of the literature by geographic region rather than topic or methodology is unusual and makes it difficult to formulate a common framework that would help organize the many contributions. Next, we distill distinct patterns in authorship, choice of topics, and asserted contributions of China-related studies. Studies are increasingly shaped by the availability of new data and regulatory reforms. These features should be interpreted carefully, as most reforms are interconnected and reflect the purposeful outcome of a tightly controlled economy. As a result, issues of generalizability arise. Alternatively, researchers could embrace the China setting and strive to identify the local institutional forces that make it special.

Country differences in labor market competition and earnings management are also related to mean reversion in accounting returns – but the relation varies with firm performance. Country labor competition increases mean reversion when unexpected returns are positive, but dampens it when unexpected returns are negative. Accounting returns in countries with higher earnings management mean revert more slowly for profitable firms and more rapidly for loss firms. Thus, earnings management incentives to slow or speed up mean reversion in accounting returns are accentuated in countries where there is a high propensity for earnings management.

We study the impact of import competition on U.S. corporate innovation and present some new perspectives. We conjecture that U.S. firms view import competition from high-wage countries (HWCs) as “neck-and-neck” competition and will respond by intensifying innovation. In contrast, U.S. firms will reduce innovation in response to import competition from low-wage countries (LWCs), because such competition does not always increase the potential benefits from innovation. Our empirical results are supportive. We find that, when confronting HWC import competition, U.S. firms increase R&D spending while intensifying and improving innovation output (file more patents, receive more citations to their patents, and produce more breakthrough patents). Moreover, U.S. firms closest to the technological frontier – largest firms, firms with the largest stocks of knowledge, and most profitable firms – increase and improve their innovation the most in response to HWC competition.

This tension is challenging. If a new venture is not seen as legitimate, usually by conforming to typical models of firms in its category, it will struggle to access resources, attract customers, satisfy regulators and curry favor from other stakeholders. This makes commercialization challenging. At the same time, entrepreneurs must convince customers, investors, and suppliers that their nascent firm is offering something new and valuable. This is the challenge of optimal distinctiveness: how different can and should firms be?
Prior research addressing the challenge of optimal distinctiveness has suggested that firms strike a strategic balance between conformity for legitimation and competitive differentiation, and also that firms should be as different as legitimately possible. While similar, there is ambiguity in these prescriptions. Should firms perfectly balance legitimacy and differentiation, or aggressively differentiate themselves beyond a base level of legitimacy? How to achieve optimal distinctiveness remains unclear. Clouding matters further, how a firm seeks legitimation and pursues differentiation is contextual depending on industry, technology stage, constituents and other factors. This means that the path to optimal distinctiveness likely demonstrates equifinality.
We adopt a configurational approach, exploring optimal distinctiveness in the context of newly commercializing Canadian clean technology firms. We consider how firms use differentiating framing and collaboration strategies in the context of radical technology, incumbent dependency, relevant entrepreneurial experience, and presence in international markets. Rather than assuming a singular point of optimal distinctiveness, we explore how different combinations of strategies and conditions can lead to successful commercialization. Methodologically, we adopt an exploratory qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) approach.
Our study elaborates theory on optimal distinctiveness by developing the notion of a legitimacy threshold. We argue that successfully commercializing firms are those that seek levels of differentiation that go beyond merely striking a strategic balance. In the process we identify combinations of strategies and contextual conditions associated with successful commercialization as well as non-commercialization.",Crossref,0.0,10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.03.004,2018.0,Journal of Business Venturing,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-title:Finding the threshold: A configurational approach to optimal distinctiveness,Finding the threshold: A configurational approach to optimal distinctiveness,10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.03.004,,Goal 17,0.02412796695369761,False,

We evaluate the effects of one such program in a large Chinese city using novel data of mobile platform transactions of 1 million program participants. Exploiting participants’ rush to the first-come, first-served digital portal, we compare spending among those who won coupons to those who lost because of minor differences in the timing of their arrival at the portal. We find that coupons generate an immediate increase in weekly consumption among winners by $3 additional out-of-pocket spending for every $1 in government subsidy. Coupon-winning consumers practice intertemporal substitution by moving up purchases that would have been made months in the future. Analysis of business customer flows suggests that coupons distort consumption toward more expensive options, leading the program to disproportionately favor big firms that sell pricier goods and services.

Opens a new window","Although innovation sharing between a buyer and a supplier—a common practice in the automotive industry—can increase the efficiency and total profit of a supply chain, suppliers are often reluctant to do so. Sharing innovations would leave the supplier in a vulnerable position if the buyer were to exploit the information (e.g., by resharing the supplier’s innovation with competing suppliers). Anecdotal evidence from automotive suppliers tells us that the nature of a supplier-buyer relationship for the most part depends on who (e.g., a short-run-focused procurement manager or a long-term-focused engineer) manages the relationship. In this paper, we examine how the allocation of decision rights to short-run- and long-run-focused employees affects collaboration between the firms. To accomplish this, we model a relationship between a supplier and a buyer where the buyer is a dual decision maker, consisting of long-run- and/or short-run-focused employees. We characterize the equilibrium of this model and show that the frequency of collaborative outcomes is lowest when the procurement manager has full control and highest when the engineer has full control or in a setup where employees can unilaterally enforce collaboration. A laboratory experiment confirms that collaborations occur more frequently when a manager with a long-term focus is in charge of or actively involved in decision making. Depending on how joint control is structured, joint control can help or hurt collaboration: Collaboration is highest when employees can unilaterally enforce it, whereas the random joint-control case results in collaboration that is as low as in the procurement manager control case.

Opens a new window","When designing an assortment, a fundamental trade‐off exists between estimating consumer behavior more precisely and solving the corresponding optimization problem efficiently. For instance, a mixture of logit model can closely approximate any random‐utility choice model; however, it is not suitable for optimization when the number of customer segments and the number of products considered are large. As many companies are using big data and marketing analytics toward microsegmenting consumers, a choice model that is amenable in the problem size becomes necessary for assortment design. In this work, we provide a new approach to approximate any random‐utility choice model by characterizing the estimation errors in a classical exogenous demand model and significantly improving its performance with a rescaling method. We show that the resulting approximation is exact for Multinomial Logit (MNL). If, however, the underlying true choice model is not MNL, we show numerically that the approximation under our so‐called rescaled two‐attempt model outperforms the widely used MNL approximation, and provides performance close to the Markov chain approximation (in some cases, it performs better than the Markov chain approximation). Our proposed approximation can be used to solve a general assortment optimization problem with a variety of (linear) real‐world constraints. In contrast to the more direct Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO) approach that utilizes Latent Class Multinomial Logit (LC‐MNL), whose running time increases exponentially in the number of mixtures, our approximation yields an alternative MIO formulation whose empirical running time is independent of the number of mixtures.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12916,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12916,2019.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:(Rescaled) Multi‐Attempt Approximation of Choice Model and Its Application to As,(Rescaled) Multi‐Attempt Approximation of Choice Model and Its Application to Assortment Optimization,10.1111/poms.12916,,Goal 17,0.008114408788367656,False,

Demand in each period is stochastic and price-dependent, and unsatisfied demands are backlogged. At the beginning of each period, the firm determines its selling price and inventory replenishment quantity, but it knows neither the form of demand dependency on selling price nor the distribution of demand uncertainty a priori, hence it has to make pricing and ordering decisions based on historical demand data. We propose a nonparametric data-driven policy that learns about the demand on the fly and, concurrently, applies learned information to determine replenishment and pricing decisions. The policy integrates learning and action in a sense that the firm actively experiments on pricing and inventory levels to collect demand information with the least possible profit loss.

Capacity reservation in a shared supplier,"When a supplier serves multiple buyers, the buyers often reserve the supplier's capacity in advance to secure the supply to fulfill their demand. In this study, we analyze two common types of capacity reservation: exclusive and first‐priority reservations. Both reservations give a buyer first access to its reserved capacity, but the reservations differ in how the leftovers (if any) are used. In most cases, as long as the buyer gets to use the reserved capacity first, it does not pay attention to how the leftover capacity is utilized, leaving that to the supplier's discretion ( first‐priority). However, in a number of cases, buyers prohibit discretionary use of the reserved capacity (“no one touches my leftovers”) and implement the restriction by placing an employee at the supplier or installing monitoring devices ( exclusive). One potential benefit of first‐priority capacity is resource pooling: allowing access to one another's leftovers can reduce the amount of capacity reserved by the buyers while enabling the supplier to satisfy buyers’ orders better in some cases. The Operations Management literature suggests that the benefit of resource pooling is greater when the demand correlation is negative and smaller when the correlation is positive. We investigate the capacity reservation type and level that each buyer chooses facing uncertain (and correlated) demand. We investigate how the reservation price and demand correlation affect the equilibrium outcome. We also examine the supplier's decision to set the optimal reservation prices. We find that at least one firm reserves first‐priority capacity in equilibrium as long as the supplier offers a discount for first‐priority capacity (or charges a premium for exclusive capacity). Depending on the reservation price difference and demand correlation, we find that the equilibrium outcome is inefficient (i.e., not Pareto optimal) for the buyers when they settle in a free‐rider or a prisoner's dilemma equilibrium. We show that the supplier always induces both buyers to reserve a large amount of exclusive capacity so that the supplier can make profits from both capacity reservation and production. While this seems like the best scenario for the supplier, we show that, allowing bilateral capacity transfer (e.g., the buyers trading their reserved capacity) can improve not only the buyers’ profits but also the supplier's profit.",Crossref,91.04477611940298,10.1111/poms.13081,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13081,2019.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:To share or not to share?

Opens a new window","This study investigates the effects of conditional promotions (e.g., buy 2 or more, get 30% off; spend $50 or more, get $15 off) on consumer behavior and the seller's profit. When a deal is presented with a minimum purchase quantity or a minimum spending requirement, experimental studies have shown some consumers are induced to spend more in order to obtain a discount. To study this behavior, we model a market in which consumers can be heterogeneous in two dimensions: willingness to pay for the product and deal proneness to a price discount. We examine two types of conditional promotions that are widely used in practice: (i) all‐unit discount, in which a price reduction applies to every unit of a purchase once the minimum requirement is met, and (ii) fixed‐amount discount, in which a fixed amount of discount is awarded to the total expense that meets the requirement. We show that deal‐prone consumers may be induced to overspend when offered a conditional discount. However, consumer overspending benefits the seller only when the market contains a sufficiently large proportion of highly deal‐prone or high‐valuation consumers. Comparing the two types of discounts, we show that the all‐unit discount outperforms the fixed‐amount discount when the regular price for the product is high, whereas the fixed‐amount discount is more profitable than the all‐unit discount when some consumers would make a purchase even without a discount. Our study suggests adopting an appropriate type of conditional discount can effectively improve the seller's profit over what would be obtained through selling at the regular price or a conventional price markdown. Furthermore, we find that conditional discounts can also improve consumer welfare, resulting in win‐win situations for both retailers and consumers.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12877,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12877,2018.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Conditional Promotions and Consumer Overspending Opens a new window,Conditional Promotions and Consumer Overspending,10.1111/poms.12877,,Goal 12,0.009500988257196518,False,consumer behavior

This is a challenging problem to solve optimally, so we derive a theoretical bound on the performance of a deterministic control (DC) in which all random variables are replaced by their expected values and the corresponding deterministic optimization problem is solved. This is a variant of an approach that is widely used in practice. We show that while DC can perform poorly in some instances, simple reoptimizations of DC (i.e., certainty equivalent control (CEC)) improve the performance of DC. That said, the benefit of reoptimization decreases as the magnitude of demand variation increases. To address this, and also to provide guidance for heuristic design, we derive performance bounds for two additional heuristic controls—(1) open-loop feedback control (OLFC), which reoptimizes a sequence of stochastic programs with a complete demand distribution information, and (2) multipoint approximation control (MPAC), which solves a dynamic program using an approximate demand distribution that incorporates slightly more distributional information beyond simple expected values. We show that although OLFC outperforms CEC, its improvement can be limited. On the other hand, with carefully chosen approximate demand distributions, MPAC can significantly outperform OLFC. This suggests that, in our setting, fully capturing decision dynamics coupled with a small amount of additional distributional information beyond expected values is more useful than fully capturing the demand distribution but coupling that with insufficient modeling of decision dynamics.

The capacity adjustment is costly and often subject to managerial hurdles, which sometimes make it difficult to adjust capacity multiple times. To clearly analyze the impact of demand learning on the firm’s decision, we study two scenarios. In the first scenario, the firm’s capacity adjustment cost increases significantly with respect to the number of adjustments because of significant managerial hurdles, and resultantly the firm has a single opportunity to adjust capacity (single adjustment scenario). In the second scenario, the capacity adjustment cost does not change with respect to the number of adjustments because of little managerial hurdles, and therefore the firm has multiple opportunities to adjust capacity (multiple adjustment scenario). For both scenarios, we first formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program, and then characterize the firm’s optimal policy: when to adjust and by how much. We show that the optimal decision on when and by how much to change the capacity is not monotone in the likelihood of high demand in the single adjustment scenario, while the optimal decision is monotone under mild conditions, and the optimal policy is a control band policy in the multiple adjustment scenario. The sharp contrast reflects the impact of demand learning on the firm’s optimal capacity decision. Since computing and implementing the optimal policy is not tractable for general problems, we develop a data-driven heuristic for each scenario. In the single adjustment scenario, we show that a two-step heuristic, which explores demand for an appropriately chosen length of time and adjusts the capacity based on the observed demand is asymptotically optimal, and show the convergence rate. In the multiple adjustment scenario, we also show that a multistep heuristic under which the firm adjusts its capacity at a predetermined set of periods with an exponentially increasing gap between two consecutive decisions is asymptotically optimal and shows its convergence rate.

In practice, this concern is addressed by restricting the use of the capacity. We consider what happens when two competing firms invest in a shared supplier. We consider two scenarios that differ in how capacity is used: exclusive capacity and first‐priority capacity. We model firms' investment and production decisions, and analyze the equilibrium outcomes in terms of the number of investing firms and capacity levels for each scenario; realized capacity is a stochastic function of investment levels. We also identify conditions under which the spillover effect occurs, where one firm taps into the other firm's invested capacity. Although the spillover supposedly intensifies competition, it actually discourages firms' investment. We also characterize the firms' and supplier's preference about the capacity type. While the non‐investing firm always prefers spillovers from the first‐priority capacity, the investing firm does not always want to shut off the other firm's access to its leftover capacity, especially when allowing spillover induces the other firm not to invest. The supplier's preference depends on the trade‐off between over‐investment and flexibility.",Crossref,92.0,10.1111/poms.12348,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12348,2015.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Investing in a shared supplier in a competitive market: Stochastic capacity case,Investing in a Shared Supplier in a Competitive Market: Stochastic Capacity Case,10.1111/poms.12348,,Goal 17,0.04515233703881107,False,capacity building; statistical capacity building

Opens a new window","Understanding the drivers of market concentration in the generic pharmaceutical industry is essential to guaranteeing the availability of low-cost generics. In this paper, we develop a structural model to capture the multiple determinants governing manufacturers’ entry decisions; in particular, we focus on how manufacturing complexity and the regulatory environment for generics approval affect concentration in drug markets. We estimate the model using data collated from six disparate sources. We find that manufacturing complexity, as reflected in the number of active ingredients, for example, significantly reduces the likelihood of generics entry. Moreover, the delay in the review process for the generics applications significantly affects the number of firms entering a market. Our policy simulations suggest that a shortened drug approval review time significantly increases the average number of entrants per market and reduces the fraction of markets with no generics entry; however, a notable portion of markets would still lack any generic competition.

Opens a new window","Using a multitier mapping of supply-chain relationships constructed from granular global, firm-to-firm supplier–customer linkages data, we quantify the degree of financial risk propagation from the supply network beyond firms’ direct supply-chain connections and isolate structural network properties serving as significant moderators of risk propagation. We first document a baseline fact: a significant proportion of tier-2 suppliers are shared by tier-1 suppliers. We then construct two simple metrics to capture the degree of tier-2 sharing and disentangle its effect from tier-2 suppliers’ own risks. We show that the focal firms’ risk levels are significantly related to the proportion of shared tier-2 suppliers in their supply network, and the effect becomes monotonically stronger as their tier-2 suppliers become more highly shared. Finally, we uncover causal relationships behind these associations using a new source of exogenous, idiosyncratic risk events in an event study setting. We show that, as tier-2 suppliers are impacted by these events, focal firms experience negative abnormal returns, the magnitude of which is significantly larger when the impacted tier-2 suppliers are more heavily shared. Overall, our study uncovers the subtier network structure as an important risk source for the focal firm, with the degree of tier-2 sharing as the main moderator.

These “unintended consequences” that are a direct result of our current regulatory regimes limit competition, keep drug costs high, and lead to shortages and the proliferation of illegitimate and unregistered drugs. While NRAs can gain a lot from increased investment in their work, regulatory harmonization and innovation can arrest and reverse the regulatory failures we still see today and improve medicine access in Africa. Unfortunately, harmonization initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa have made modest impact and have done so slowly.

In this paper we consider the dynamic risk management problem for a commodity processor operating in a partially complete market, facing both price uncertainty and significant financial distress costs. The firm procures an input commodity, processes it to produce an output commodity, and trades the output commodity in each period over a multiperiod horizon. The firm’s objective is to dynamically and jointly plan operational and financial hedging decisions to maximize the market-based value of cash flows under a time-consistent risk measure. We show that the optimal operational policy has the same price and horizon dependent threshold structure that obtains when markets are complete. We also characterize conditions under which a myopic policy is optimal. We present numerical studies to illustrate that (i) compared to using a myopic policy or a policy that neglects to model financial distress costs, the advantage of using the optimal policy is significant for firms that face moderate financial distress costs and have excess procurement capacity; (ii) more acute financial distress costs reduce the firm’s market-based value and throughput; and (iii) financial hedging provides considerable benefit by reducing the incidence of large negative cash flows.

Nevertheless, the costs of delivering specific products are poorly understood and ballpark estimates are often used to inadequately plan for the budgetary implications of supply chain expenses. The purpose of this research was to estimate the country level costs of the public sector supply chain for artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) from the central to the peripheral levels in Benin and Kenya. A micro-costing approach was used and primary data on the various cost components of the supply chain was collected at the central, intermediate, and facility levels between September and November 2013. Information sources included central warehouse databases, health facility records, transport schedules, and expenditure reports. Data from document reviews and semi-structured interviews were used to identify cost inputs and estimate actual costs. Sampling was purposive to isolate key variables of interest. Survey guides were developed and administered electronically. Data were extracted into Microsoft Excel®, and the supply chain cost per unit of ACT and RDT distributed by function and level of system was calculated. In Benin, supply chain costs added USD 0.2011 to the initial acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0.3375 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). In Kenya, they added USD 0.2443 to the acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0.1895 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). Total supply chain costs accounted for more than 30% of the initial acquisition cost of the products in some cases and these costs were highly sensitive to product volumes. The major cost drivers were found to be labour, transport, and utilities with health facilities carrying the majority of the cost per unit of product. Accurate cost estimates are needed to ensure adequate resources are available for supply chain activities. Product volumes should be considered when costing supply chain functions rather than dollar value. Further work is needed to develop extrapolative costing models that can be applied at country level without extensive micro-costing exercises. This will allow other countries to generate more accurate estimates in the future.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1186/s12936-014-0530-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c2d969d8070d222d2516d18263be635c56d68d20,2015.0,Malaria Journal,ok,CR-title:Costing the supply chain for delivery of ACT and RDTs in the public sector in Be,Costing the supply chain for delivery of ACT and RDTs in the public sector in Benin and Kenya,10.1186/s12936-014-0530-1,,Goal 9,0.03285542107865142,False,

Because beliefs are rarely observed, researchers typically assume that consumers have rational expectations or update beliefs consistent with Bayesian updating. These assumptions are restrictive and do not enable the researcher or the retailer to price discriminate among consumers on the basis of heterogeneity in beliefs. The authors use Monte Carlo experiments to show how these assumptions affect estimates of search cost. Next, they design an incentive-aligned online study in which participants search over the price of a homogeneous good, and the authors elicit distributions of price beliefs before and after each search. Drawing on data collected from a nationally representative panel, they find substantial heterogeneity in prior price beliefs, such that participants update their beliefs in response to search outcomes but deviate from Bayesian updating in that they underreact to new information. Importantly, the authors show that (1) assuming Bayesian updating does not significantly bias search cost estimates at the aggregate level if the researcher accounts for heterogeneous prior beliefs, (2) eliciting heterogeneity in prior expected prices is much more important than eliciting heterogeneity in prior price uncertainty, and (3) a retailer can increase profits through third-degree price discrimination by recognizing the heterogeneity in prior beliefs.",Crossref,94.11764705882354,10.1177/0022243720982979,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720982979,2021.0,Journal of Marketing Research,ok,CR-title:The Importance of Consumer Beliefs in Product Search,The Importance of Price Beliefs in Consumer Search,10.1177/0022243720982979,,Goal 10,0.006472338900177389,False,

However, how those attributes are expressed has important consequences for their choices and thus for conclusions drawn by market researchers about attribute importance. Expanded attribute scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in minutes) leads consumers to perceive greater differences between scale levels than contracted scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in hours). The authors show in two domains that simply expanding an attribute's scale can shift choice toward alternatives that perform well on a scale that is expanded and thus can impact conjoint results such as attribute importance and screening. Thus, practitioners should take care when they choose precisely how to elicit preferences or how to describe their products: the extent of the scale's expansion will determine researchers’ inferences about the importance of the attribute it describes.

We first conducted a series of measure development studies to validate a measure of individual work reflection comprising four dimensions of reflection at work: goals‐, methods‐, relationships‐, and self‐focused reflection. Then, across two independent studies assessing individuals in self‐managing teams over time, we found support for our theoretical model linking individual work reflection to peer‐rated leadership behaviors (Main Studies 1 and 2) and leadership effectiveness (Main Study 2). In further support of our theorizing, Main Study 2 also indicates that individual work reflection shapes leadership behaviors and effectiveness via understanding the team's needs, beyond a wide range of related constructs (e.g., feedback seeking, mindfulness, and rumination), as well as commonly studied predictors of leadership behaviors (i.e., the Big Five).

We then outline why both organizations and individuals may prefer gig work, offer an in-depth analysis of the ways in which the traditional psychological contract has been altered for both organizations and gig workers, and detail the impact of that new contract on gig workers. Specifically, organizations deconstruct jobs into standardized tasks and gig workers adapt by engaging in job crafting and work identity management. Second, organizational recruitment of gig workers alters the level and type of commitment gig workers feel toward an employing organization. Third, organizations use a variety of nontraditional practices to manage gig workers (e.g., including by digital algorithms) and gig workers adapt by balancing autonomy and dependence. Fourth, compensation tends to be project-based and typically lacks benefits, causing gig workers to learn to be a ""jack-of-all-trades"" and learn to deal with pay volatility. Fifth, organizational training of gig workers is limited, and they adapt by engaging in self-development. Sixth, gig workers develop alternative professional and social relationships to work in blended teams assembled by organizations and/or adapt to social isolation. Challenges associated with these practices and possible solutions are discussed, and we develop propositions for testing in future research.

Opens a new window","Despite the common portrait of leadership as a worthy, needed, and frequently rewarded endeavor, individuals do not always step up to lead as informal leaders in their teams. In the present research, we introduce the idea of leadership risk perceptions, arguing that individuals sometimes see risks for themselves if they step up to lead. We conceptualize three types of leadership risk perceptions (interpersonal, image, and instrumental) and investigate how changes in these risk perceptions over time impact the overall level of informal leadership that individuals contribute in their teams, as well as how these risk perceptions’ change trajectories are shaped by the level of conflict in a team. To address these issues, we conducted a series of studies, exploring the relevance of the three risk perceptions qualitatively, developing measures for them, and then testing our hypotheses in a field study following 454 individuals working in 89 master of business administration (MBA) consulting teams. We found that a decrease in an individual’s leadership risk perceptions over time was related to the individual’s overall informal leadership contributions in the team, though the pattern of relationship was not the same for all three risk perceptions. Furthermore, in teams with higher levels of relationship conflict, interpersonal and image risk perceptions decreased less over time, suggesting the importance of the social context in shaping perceived risks. Overall, this research calls attention to the much under-investigated risky side of leadership and highlights a temporal approach to understanding the impact of leadership risk perceptions.",Crossref,89.73384030418251,10.1287/orsc.2019.1350,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2019.1350,2020.0,Organization Science,ok,CR-title:The Risky Side of Leadership: Conceptualizing Leadership Risk Perceptions and In,The Risky Side of Leadership: Conceptualizing Risk Perceptions in Informal Leadership and Investigating the Effects of Their Over-Time Changes in Teams,10.1287/orsc.2019.1350,,Goal 5,0.02863049506598288,False,

Opens a new window","Building on an inductive, qualitative study of independent workers—people not affiliated with an organization or established profession—this paper develops a theory about the management of precarious and personalized work identities. We find that in the absence of organizational or professional membership, workers experience stark emotional tensions encompassing both the anxiety and fulfillment of working in precarious and personal conditions. Lacking the holding environment provided by an organization, the workers we studied endeavored to create one for themselves through cultivating connections to routines, places, people, and a broader purpose. These personal holding environments helped them manage the broad range of emotions stirred up by their precarious working lives and focus on producing work that let them define, express, and develop their selves. Thus holding environments transformed workers’ precariousness into a tolerable and even generative predicament. By clarifying the process through which people manage emotions associated with precarious and personalized work identities, and thereby render their work identities viable and their selves vital, this paper advances theorizing on the emotional underpinnings of identity work and the systems psychodynamics of independent work.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/0001839218759646,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839218759646,2018.0,Administrative Science Quarterly,ok,CR-title:Agony and Ecstasy in the Gig Economy: Cultivating Holding Environments for Manag,Agony and Ecstasy in the Gig Economy: Cultivating Holding Environments for Precarious and Personalized Work Identities,10.1177/0001839218759646,,Goal 8,0.03958286942741794,False,precarious employment

Opens a new window","Problem definition: Retailers have become increasingly interested in personalizing their products and services such as promotions. For this, we need new personalized demand models. Unfortunately, social data are not available to many retailers because of cost and privacy issues. Thus, we focus on the problem of detecting customer relationships from transactional data and using them to target promotions to the right customers. Academic/practical relevance: From an academic point of view, this paper solves the novel problem of jointly detecting customer trends and using them for optimal promotion targeting. Notably, we estimate the causal customer-to-customer trend effect solely from transactional data and target promotions for multiple items and time periods. In practice, we provide a new tool for Oracle Retail clients that personalizes promotions. Methodology: We develop a novel customer trend demand model distinguishing between a base purchase probability, capturing factors such as price and seasonality, and a customer trend probability, capturing customer-to-customer trend effects. The estimation procedure is based on regularized bounded variables least squares and instrumental variable methods. The resulting customer trend estimates feed into the dynamic promotion targeting optimization problem, formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer optimization model. Though it is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard, we propose a greedy algorithm. Results: We prove that our customer-to-customer trend estimates are statistically consistent and that the greedy optimization algorithm is provably good. Having access to Oracle Retail fashion client data, we show that our demand model reduces the weighted-mean absolute percentage error by 11% on average. Also, we provide evidence of the causality of our estimates. Finally, we demonstrate that the optimal policy increases profits by 3%–11%. Managerial implications: The demand model with customer trend and the optimization model for targeted promotions form a decision-support tool for promotion planning. Next to general planning, it also helps to find important customers and target them to generate additional sales.

With that growth many opportunities and challenges have sprung up in the areas of predictive and prescriptive analytics. Often, optimization can play an important role in tackling these issues. In this paper, we review some recent advances that highlight the difference that optimization can make in data-driven decision-making. We discuss some of our contributions that aim to advance both predictive and prescriptive models. First, we describe how we can optimally estimate clustered models that result in improved predictions. Next, we consider how we can optimize over objective functions that arise from tree ensemble models in order to obtain better prescriptions. Finally, we discuss how we can learn optimal solutions directly from the data allowing for prescriptions without the need for predictions. For all these new methods, we stress the need for good performance but also the scalability to large heterogeneous datasets.",Crossref,78.3625730994152,10.1007/s10107-022-01874-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-022-01874-9,2022.0,Mathematical Programming,ok,CR-title:The Role of Optimization in Some Recent Advances in Data-Driven Decision-Making ,The role of optimization in some recent advances in data-driven decision-making,10.1007/s10107-022-01874-9,,Goal 17,0.01352111793766643,False,

We show that, under conditions, the problem of optimally sequencing the requests in this system with a buffer size of m loads forms a special case of the multiple traveling salesmen problem in which each salesman visits the same number of cities. Several interesting structural properties for the problem are mathematically shown. In addition, a branch-and-cut method and heuristics are proposed.

Opens a new window","In addition to setting price discounts, retailers need to decide how to schedule promotion vehicles, such as flyers and TV commercials. Unlike the promotion pricing problem that received great attention from both academics and practitioners, the promotion vehicle scheduling problem was largely overlooked, and our goal is to study this problem both theoretically and in practice. We model the problem of scheduling promotion vehicles to maximize profits as a nonlinear bipartite matching-type problem, where promotion vehicles should be assigned to time periods, subject to capacity constraints. Our modeling approach is motivated and calibrated using actual data in collaboration with Oracle Retail, leading us to introduce and study a class of models for which the boost effects of promotion vehicles on demand are multiplicative. From a technical perspective, we prove that the general setting considered is computationally intractable. Nevertheless, we develop approximation algorithms and propose a compact integer programming formulation. In particular, we show how to obtain a (1 − ε)-approximation using an integer program of polynomial size, and investigate the performance of a greedy procedure, both analytically and computationally. We also discuss an extension that includes cross-term effects to capture the cannibalization aspect of using several vehicles simultaneously. From a practical perspective, we test our methods on actual data through a case study, and quantify the impact of our models. Under our model assumptions and for a particular item considered in our case study, we show that a rigorous optimization approach to the promotion vehicle scheduling problem allows the retailer to increase its profit by 2% to 9%.

Specifically, we investigate whether considering the smoothness of firm-level earnings increases the informativeness of aggregate earnings for future real GDP, and if so, whether macroeconomic forecasters use this information efficiently. Using recently-developed mixed data sampling methods, we find that the aggregate is tilted towards firms with smoother earnings and that this composition of aggregate earnings outperforms traditional weighting schemes. Further, this tilted aggregate has a stronger positive association with forecast revisions; in fact, analysts who utilize earnings the most in their forecasts appear to fully impound the informativeness of earnings smoothness.

Opens a new window","Purpose This paper aims to identify distinct consumption patterns among Asian consumers and examine how these relate to cultural antecedents and key human values. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a large, representative sample of almost 7,000 Asian consumers in 10 culturally varying markets, using latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify the consumption profiles. Findings The findings empirically demonstrate that the two profiles are “inner-directed nationalistic frugals” (IDNF) and “outer-directed self-eekers” (ODSS). IDNF consumers spend more time and money on education and prefer ethnocentric consumption. ODSS consumers emphasize individuality, self-expression, seeking novelty and impressing others. Consumers with more collective values in Schwartz's typology tend to demonstrate the IDNF pattern; those with more individualistic values demonstrate the ODSS pattern. The distribution of IDNF and ODSS profiles is influenced by demographics, religion and geographical region: IDNF is greater than ODSS in Southeast Asia; ODSS is greater than IDNF in East Asia; IDNF is roughly equal to ODSS in Northeast Asia. IDNF tends to be found among older and more religious consumers, while ODSS is the opposite. Importantly, in the more religious Southeast Asian countries, even younger consumers are more IDNF than ODSS. Research limitations/implications This research uses an exploratory and discovery-oriented approach; future research can use more confirmatory approaches to systematically examine the relationship between cultural dimensions (e.g. individualism-collectivism) and consumption patterns. Practical implications For their brands to grow in Asian markets, marketing practitioners are advised to use multiple brands to segment Asian consumers based on their values, demographics, geographical location and what religious/faith traditions they follow.

The effect holds both when individuals’ global–local citizenship identity is measured and when it is manipulated. The research further establishes an important boundary condition for the effect. The effect holds in the citizenship identity context because people normally associate themselves with both local and global citizenship identities, and situational or dispositional factors only influence the degree to which they associate with each identity.

Being a “cosmopolites” was a fundamentally ethical stance, without any specifically political implications.

The theme of global citizenship has been developed by successors of Kant such as Karl Jaspers and Martha Nussbaum. The ethical, institutional, and aspirational aspects of global citizenship are explored, without assumptions about world government being a prerequisite. It is argued that we cannot assume that a cosmopolitan stance has become uncontroversial. The bearing of globalization on global citizenship is remarked; thus, the rise of the internet and of international campaigning websites have fostered a sense of global solidarity, but the activities of multinational corporations have frequently served to increase global inequality. Consideration is given to the issue of whether global citizenship is restricted to those who consciously subscribe to the role of global citizen, or extends to all bearers of human rights.

We find first that for low dialectics, felt ambivalence—and discomfort—is greater for mixed information messages than for negative or positive information. For high dialectics, however, mixed information leads to high felt ambivalence, but not to high discomfort. When given univalent positive or negative information messages, high dialectics have more thoughts about information opposite in valence to that presented, when presented with negative information messages. As a result, for high dialectics, univalent negative information produces the same high felt ambivalence, and even greater discomfort, than do mixed information messages. Through these non‐parallel effects, we show that the relationship between felt ambivalence and discomfort is itself moderated by dialecticism. Through three experiments and using a novel manipulation of dialecticism, we replicate and generalize these effects and provide process evidence.",Crossref,91.25,10.1016/j.jcps.2015.10.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2015.10.003,2015.0,Journal of Consumer Psychology,ok,CR-title:The Moderating Role of Dialecticism in Consumer Responses to Product Information,The moderating role of dialecticism in consumer responses to product information,10.1016/j.jcps.2015.10.003,,Goal 16,0.00953006605444254,False,

Opens a new window","Buyers are increasingly pressured to ensure sustainability of their suppliers, but they are also under pressure for low‐cost procurement. To make a more informed procurement decision, a buyer can choose to invest in sustainability assessments, and select a supplier based on their price bids and cost markup terms informed by the sustainability assessments. However, sustainability assessments are costly, and whether to use them is at the discretion of the buyer. Hence, the buyer can instead choose to forgo the assessments and select a supplier based on price only. In this study, we explore this trade‐off. We find that the value of assessments depends on the buyer’s business environment in some surprising ways. For example, although sustainability assessments are used to identify the suppliers’ sustainability levels, greater ex ante variability and a decrease in suppliers’ average sustainability levels (e.g., facing a supplier base in a country with looser sustainability regulations) can decrease the value of sustainability assessments. We find that the presence of an outside option (e.g., internal production) alters the assessment policy significantly. We also explore when the buyer may prefer to assess only a subset of her suppliers. Although motivated by the use of sustainability assessments, our results are generalizable to settings where the buyer has the option to invest in total‐cost assessments on her potential suppliers’ unknown, non‐biddable, differentiator‐type attributes.",Crossref,89.52380952380952,10.1111/poms.13284,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13284,2021.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Supplier Sustainability Assessments in Total-Cost Auctions Opens a new window,Supplier Sustainability Assessments in Total‐Cost Auctions,10.1111/poms.13284,,Goal 12,0.06097790103236084,True,corporate sustainability; sustainability reporting; sustainable procurement; sustainable supply chains

Yet problem specification in such crowdsourcing contests is something the theoretical and empirical literature has largely overlooked. We aim to fill this gap by offering an empirically validated model to generate insights for the provision of information at contest launch. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model featuring different types of information (categorized as “conceptual objectives” or “execution guidelines”) in problem specifications and assess their impact on design processes and submission qualities. Real-world data are used to empirically test hypotheses and policy recommendations generated from the model, and a quasi-natural experiment provides further empirical validation. Results : We show theoretically and verify empirically that with more conceptual objectives disclosed in the problem specification, the number of participants in a contest eventually decreases; with more execution guidelines in the problem specification, the trial effort provision by each participant increases; and the best solution quality always increases with more execution guidelines but eventually decreases with more conceptual objectives.

Opens a new window","We investigate procurement in a setting in which the buyer is bound by sourcing rules. Sourcing rules may limit the minimum and maximum amounts of business that can be awarded to a single supplier or dictate the minimum number of suppliers who are awarded business, thus necessitating split awards. The buyer announces the splits before the auction, and suppliers bid accordingly. We consider two auction formats: the sealed-bid first-price auction, and a version of the open-bid descending-price auction. We characterize the suppliers’ symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy for both formats and find that the two formats yield the same expected buyer’s cost. We characterize the cost of multisourcing, showing among other things that it is always costly for the buyer to split its award among more suppliers if the suppliers’ costs are regularly distributed, but that doing so can actually reduce the buyer’s expected auction payment if the suppliers’ costs are not regularly distributed. The results from controlled laboratory experiments, involving human subjects, indicate that expected cost equivalence fails when costs are regularly distributed because suppliers bid more aggressively in the sealed-bid auction. However, for split-award auctions with nonregularly distributed costs, the sealed-bid prices are actually higher than predicted by theory. We explain these mismatches between observations and theory through a behavioral model based on bidders’ aversion to anticipated regret. The experimental results indicate that the theory does a good job of predicting the relationship between the buyer’s average cost and the award splits, as well as the cost of multisourcing. Importantly, the experiments confirm that when suppliers’ costs come from a nonregular distribution, it may be to the buyer’s advantage to diversify the supply base more than is strictly necessitated by sourcing rules.

Opens a new window","We investigate when a buyer seeking to procure multiple units of an input may find it advantageous to run a “test auction” in which she has incumbent suppliers bid on a portion of the desired units. The test auction reveals incumbent supplier cost information that helps the buyer determine how many entrants (if any) to recruit at a cost prior to awarding the remaining units. The optimal number of entrant suppliers to recruit follows a threshold policy that is monotonic in the test auction’s clearing price unless the underlying supplier cost distribution is not regular. When setting her reserve price in the test auction, the buyer uses supplier recruitment as her “outside option”: if the reserve price is not met in the test auction, the buyer recruits new suppliers and runs a second auction. We compare the attractiveness of the test auction procedure relative to the more conventional procedure in which the buyer auctions off her entire demand in one auction. Since the buyer can choose ex ante which procedure to use, we propose using whichever has lower ex ante total (purchase plus recruitment) cost. Finally, using an optimal mechanism analysis, we find a lower bound on the buyer’s cost, and use that cost as a benchmark to show that our proposed sourcing strategy performs well given its ease of implementation.

Yet research suggests that once they are formed, status beliefs in organizations become entrenched in hierarchies and are hard to dismantle. In an inductive qualitative study, we observed how established status differences between remote and in-person workers in distributed organizations dissolved during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone began working remotely. We use these data to theorize a novel status-equalizing process through which remote workers came to see themselves on an “equal playing field” with their in-person peers. We theorize how this status equalizing occurred through workers’ changing their “in-person default” use of technology—that is, their new behavior challenged embedded cultural practices that had treated the in-person workplace experience as the standard, normal, and valued perspective, implicitly guiding how employees used technology. Workers adopted new and more inclusive technology practices—including the use of asynchronous communication, greater codification of work, and virtual socializing—which resulted in remote workers perceiving new and more equal communication standards, access to information, and opportunity for social connection. As a result, these workers reported feeling less negatively stereotyped and treated more fairly in their virtual interactions with colleagues, fostering feelings of inclusion and deepening relationships across the previously established status divide.

We tested these predictions using two experimental studies: a field quasi-experiment in a Fortune 500 technology company and a controlled experiment with employees in a variety of organizations and occupations. Across the two experiments, fostering dual-growth mindset yielded gains in self-reported and observer-rated happiness that lasted at least 6 months. Fostering growth mindsets about either the self or job alone did not generate lasting increases in happiness.

We tested our hypotheses using two studies: an archival study of 5,676 movies in the U.S. film industry and a complementary experiment. Results suggest that late handoffs yielded less creative final products than no or early handoffs, meaning it was costly to creativity when employees implemented relatively mature ideas without driving at least some of their prior development. However, serialized late handoffs—when implementers are handed relatively mature ideas after an earlier handoff between two other individuals—were less costly to creativity than late handoffs from one other individual.

Opens a new window","Purpose The quality of institutions matters for firm growth. Yet, there is a research gap in controlling for moderating effect of size on institutions and firm growth in transitional context and especially in post-conflict economies. Building on institutional theory, this research aims to explore the influence of different types of institutional variables (taxes, corruption, administrative, finance and other barriers) on the growth of firms in Kosovo, while controlling for the firm size moderating effect. Design/methodology/approach The research uses linear regression analysis based on a survey with 451 owner-managers of growing small firms in the post-conflict economy of Kosovo. Findings Corruption and administrative burden are crucial factors that influence firm growth. Corruption is found to have a negative effect, and when moderated by the size of the firm, it becomes positive, suggesting that larger firms make use of informal institutions and create links with public officials to manage institutional deficiencies. This size interaction with administrative barrier variables becomes positive. Other control variables (export status, separation of ownership and control, membership in business association) suggest that managerial-level variables have a positive impact on firm growth. The human capital variable specifically indicates that companies compensate for a deficiency in formal education by providing additional training for employees and their managers. Research limitations/implications Future research based on qualitative research can contribute to a greater understanding of how larger firms use resources to overcome barriers, and to align their business strategies in the weak post-conflict environments. Originality/value This research extends current understanding of how institutional variables interact with firm size and impact firm growth.

Starting January 2020 with Colorado, 25 states and the District of Columbia enacted laws that cap insulin copayments. Objective To estimate the association of Colorado’s $100 copayment cap with out-of-pocket spending, medication adherence, and health care services utilization for diabetes-related complications. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study using Colorado’s All-Payer Claims Database, nonelderly insulin users with type 1 diabetes were analyzed from January 2019 to December 2020. Outcome changes were compared in the prepolicy and postpolicy period among individuals continuously enrolled in state-regulated and non–state-regulated plans using difference-in-differences regressions. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on individuals’ prepolicy spending (low: never ≥$100 out-of-pocket vs high: ≥$100 out-of-pocket cost at least once). Data were analyzed from June 2023 to May 2024. Exposure Enrollment in state-regulated health insurance plans subject to the copayment cap legislation. Main Outcomes and Measures Adherence to basal and bolus insulin treatment was evaluated using the proportion of days covered measure, out-of-pocket spending reflected prescription cost for a 30-day supply, and health care utilization for diabetes-related complications was identified using primary diagnosis codes from medical claims data. Results The panel included 1629 individuals with type 1 diabetes (39 096 person-months), of which 924 were male (56.7%), 540 (33.1%) had 1 or more comorbidities, and the mean (SD) age was 40.6 (15.9) years. Overall, the copayment cap was associated with out-of-pocket spending declines of $17.3 (95% CI, −$27.3 to −$7.3) for basal and $11.5 (95% CI, −$24.7 to $1.7) for bolus insulins and increases in adherence of 3.2 (95% CI, 0.0 to 6.5) percentage points for basal and 3.3 (95% CI, 0.3 to 6.4) percentage points for bolus insulins. Changes in adherence were associated with increases within the prepolicy high-spending group (basal, 9.9; 95% CI, 2.4 to 17.4 percentage points; bolus, 13.0; 95% CI, 5.1 to 20.9 percentage points).

The mandate, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS), is a levy on taxable income that applies to high-income individuals who choose not to buy private hospital insurance. Our identification strategy exploits changes in MLS liability arising from both year-to-year income fluctuations, and a reform where income thresholds were increased significantly. Using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia longitudinal survey, we estimate dynamic panel data models that account for persistence in the decision to purchase insurance stemming from unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. Our results indicate that being subject to the MLS penalty in a given year increases the probability of purchasing private hospital insurance by between 2 to 3 percent in that year. If subject to the penalty permanently, this probability grows further over the following years, reaching 13 percent after a decade. We also find evidence of a marked asymmetric effect of the MLS, where the effect of the penalty is about twice as large for individuals becoming liable compared with those going from being liable to not being liable.

However, how those attributes are expressed has important consequences for their choices and thus for conclusions drawn by market researchers about attribute importance. Expanded attribute scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in minutes) leads consumers to perceive greater differences between scale levels than contracted scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in hours). The authors show in two domains that simply expanding an attribute's scale can shift choice toward alternatives that perform well on a scale that is expanded and thus can impact conjoint results such as attribute importance and screening. Thus, practitioners should take care when they choose precisely how to elicit preferences or how to describe their products: the extent of the scale's expansion will determine researchers’ inferences about the importance of the attribute it describes.

Using Bureau of Economic Analysis data to compute a weighted supplier industry competition measure, we predict and find that higher supplier competition is associated with stronger CEO pay-for-performance incentive intensity. This effect is incremental to that of the firm’s own industry competition previously documented and is robust to alternative measures of supplier competition and to exogenous shocks to competition.

Opens a new window","Sri Lanka is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of people with diabetes mellitus (DM) due to population growth and aging. Physician shortages, outdated technology, and insufficient health education have contributed to the difficulties associated with managing the burden of disease. New models of chronic disease management are needed to address the increasing prevalence of DM.Medical students, business students, and faculty members from the University of Michigan partnered with the Grace Girls’ Home, Trincomalee General Hospital, and Selvanayakapuram Central Hospital to identify and train diabetes-focused medical assistants (MAs) to collect and enter patient data and educate patients about their disease. Return visits to these MAs were encouraged so that patient progress and disease progression could be tracked longitudinally. Data entry was conducted through a cloud-based mechanism, facilitating patient management and descriptive characterization of the population. We implemented this pilot program in June 2016 in coordination with Trincomalee General Hospital and Selvanayakapuram Central Hospital. Over a 12-month period, 93 patients were systematically assessed by the medical assistants. All patients received education and were provided materials after the visit to better inform them about the importance of controlling their disease. Fifteen percent (14/93) of patients returned for follow-up consultation.Trained MAs have the potential to provide support to physicians working in congested health systems in low-resource settings. Public investment in training programs for MAs and greater acceptance by physicians and patients will be essential for handling the growing burden associated with chronic illnesses like DM. Trained MAs may also play a role in improved patient education and awareness regarding diabetes self-management.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),81.65680473372781,10.1186/s40842-018-0074-3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7fd90f9af378f5a8a2b39d4eb02425cad7a9666b,2018.0,Clinical Diabetes and Endocrinology,ok,CR-title:A New Model for Diabetes-Focused Capacity Building – Lessons from Sri Lanka Open,A new model for diabetes-focused capacity building – lessons from Sri Lanka,10.1186/s40842-018-0074-3,,Goal 4,0.06863194866716896,True,education gaps

Opens a new window","America faces a staggering housing affordability crisis. The consequences of the crisis include reduced economic productivity, suppressed labor mobility, greater social inequity, and increased homelessness. A scholarly consensus blames excessive land-use regulation for these problems and advocates now call for deregulation. Several jurisdictions have recently elected to allow middle housing—small, multi-family developments—in areas previously zoned for single-family detached housing. The results of these reforms, however, have been disappointing. This Article examines why they have fallen short and how to do better. This Article identifies an analytical disconnect between the deregulatory consensus and actual single-family zoning reforms adopted to date. Given this disconnect and the limited success of single-family zoning reforms thus far, it is unclear why such reforms continue to be adopted. Moreover, these reforms cannot achieve their promised ends. Interviews of middle housing builders in reform jurisdictions reveal legal and structural barriers that prevent market participants from responding to the housing crisis with scale and urgency. This Article proposes several regulatory alternatives that offer a greater probability of success in achieving the consensus’s goals: (1) modestly expanding multi-family zones to allow redevelopment and densification of underutilized non-residential properties; (2) providing affordable-housing density bonuses; (3) streamlining land-use procedures and eliminating administrative delay to reduce uncertainty in permitting processes; and (4) reevaluating financing mechanisms for new housing development. Taken together, these policies are necessary complements to single-family zoning reforms for addressing undersupply of market- and below-market-rate housing.",Crossref,100.0,10.70167/ykey3834,https://doi.org/10.70167/ykey3834,2024.0,Boston College Law Review,ok,CR-title:The Black Box of Single-Family Zoning Reform Opens a new window,The Black Box of Single-Family Zoning Reform,10.70167/ykey3834,,Goal 11,0.04066252119274801,False,affordable housing; housing affordability; housing for vulnerable populations; housing infrastructure

Opens a new window","Discrimination is a pervasive aspect of modern society and human relations. Statistical discrimination theory suggests that profit-maximizing employers should use all the information about job candidates, including information about group membership (e.g., race or gender), to make accurate predictions. In contrast, research on heuristics in psychology suggests that using less information can be better. Drawing on research on heuristics, we show that even small amounts of inconsistency can make predictions using group membership less accurate than predictions that do not use this information. That is, whereas statistical discrimination theory implies that better predictions can be achieved by using all available information about an individual (including group characteristics that may be correlated with but do not cause performance), our model shows that using all available information only improves predictive accuracy under a very specific set of conditions, thus suggesting that statistical discrimination often results in worse predictions. By understanding when statistical discrimination improves or worsens predictions, our work cautions decision makers and uncovers paths toward reducing the occurrence of situations in which statistical discrimination benefits predictive accuracy, thus reducing its pervasiveness in society.

Opens a new window","A long-standing question in the organizations literature is whether firms are better off by using simple or complex representations of their task environment. We address this question by developing a formal model of how firm performance depends on the process by which firms learn and use representations. Building on ideas from cognitive science, our model conceptualizes this process in terms of how firms construct a representation of the environment and then use that representation when making decisions. Our model identifies the optimal level of representational complexity as a function of (a) the environment’s complexity and uncertainty and (b) the firm’s experience and knowledge about the environment’s deep structure. We use this model to delineate the conditions under which firms should use simple versus complex representations; in doing so, we provide a coherent framework that integrates previous conflicting results on which type of representation leaves firms better off. Among other results, we show that the optimal representational complexity generally depends more on the firm’s knowledge about the environment than it does on the environment’s actual complexity. We also show that the relative advantage of heuristics vis-à-vis more complex representations critically depends on an unstated assumption of “informedness”: that managers can know what are the most relevant variables to pay attention to. We show that when this assumption does not hold, complex representations are usually better than simpler ones.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),81.29032258064515,10.5465/ambpp.2017.13686abstract,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/896b3e26912c911f913660b8dcf155d6f2dcf7dd,2017.0,"Organization science (Providence, R.I.)",ok,CR-title:A contingency theory of representational complexity in organizations Opens a new,A Contingency Theory of Representational Complexity in Organizations,10.5465/ambpp.2017.13686abstract,,Goal 9,0.01145756903162902,False,

Opens a new window","Research summary : Managers' mental representations affect the perceived payoffs and alternatives that managers consider. Thus, mental representations affect how managers search for profitable strategies as well as the quality of strategies they discover. To study how mental representation and search interact, we formally model the dual search over possible representations and over policy choices of a strategy “landscape.” We analyze when it is preferable to emphasize searching for the best policies rather than the best mental representation, and vice versa. We show that, in the long run, a balance between the two search modes not only results in better expected performance, but also reduces the variation in performance. Additionally, the article describes conditions under which increased accuracy of mental representations can actually worsen firm performance . Managerial summary : Managers' mental representations affect the perceived payoffs and alternatives that managers consider. Thus, mental representations affect the quality of strategies managers can discover. We analyze a computer simulation of how managers use mental representations to search for strategies. This sheds light on how managers should deal with the trade‐off between searching for policies and searching for representations; that is, whether managers should think creatively about how to represent a strategy problem or whether they should just stick to the current problem understanding, and try to find ways to improve performance as suggested by the current representation. We provide insight regarding the balance between the two search modes and describe conditions under which increasingly accurate mental representations can worsen firm performance .

In order to make good on this promise, however, organization theory needs to adopt a rigorously comparative approach and to jettison “America first.” Those who organize firms require ingredients that often include capital, labor, supplies, and a rule-bound market for selling. These ingredients in turn bear the imprint of national economies and the institutions that govern and support them. We argue that innovations in information and communication technologies (ICTs) combine with national institutions to guide what firms will look like by shaping what ingredients are available; ultimately, ICTs can fundamentally reorganize institutions such as capital and labor markets. We illustrate this argument with a comparison of how the ridehailing industry (such as Uber and Lyft in the United States) is organized in the US, Sweden, Germany, India, Indonesia, China, and Nigeria. The same basic innovation—a platform that allows riders and drivers to match via smartphone—produces substantially different organizational forms depending on domestic institutions.

The objective is to maximize the expected profit, which includes customer-dependent revenues and holding cost and server-dependent cost. We first characterize the structure of the optimal policy for the case with two servers and two types of customers that have the same holding cost. We show that the optimal admission and routing policy has a complex non-monotone structure; however, we show that this non-monotone structure is the result of overlapping of three pairwise dominant policies that have a monotone structure. Utilizing the above structure, we propose three heuristics for the general case of multiple servers and multiple types of customers. Through a numerical study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristics, and provide conditions under which each heuristic performs well.

We explore the ways that the firms can collaborate by either building capacity together or sharing the existing capacity for production. We consider cases where the two firms' products are potential substitutes and also where the firms' products are independent. We find that a firm can benefit from collaboration even with its competitor. Moreover, the firms do not have to jointly make the production decisions to realize the benefits of collaboration. We consider a model where firms build capacity before demand is realized and make production decisions after they receive a demand signal. They can potentially collaborate in jointly building capacity and/or in exchanging capacity once they receive their demand signals. Interestingly, we find that having firms compete at the production stage can result in firms deciding to build less overall capacity than if they coordinated capacity investment and production. Also, we find that though collaboration in capacity investment is bene cial, collaboration in production using existing capacity is often more beneficial. The benefits of collaboration is largest when competition is more intense, demand is more variable and cost of investment is higher.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.2169490,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40f7c6e49b015115668bb42f36051820880f2f83,2012.0,SSRN Electronic Journal,ok,CR-title:Benefits of Collaboration in Capacity Investment and Allocation,Benefits of Collaboration in Capacity Investment and Allocation,10.2139/ssrn.2169490,,Goal 17,0.04921256784830309,False,capacity building; innovation cooperation

Second, we show that the optimal expected total revenues under the Cascade Click model can be upper-bounded by the objective value of an approximate deterministic pricing problem, and that this deterministic problem can be efficiently solved. This result is reminiscent of the classic upper-bound result in the standard Revenue Management (RM) setting, whose importance and impact on RM research in the past two decades cannot be overstated.

Our model is the first to capture the key operational features in this context. Methodology: We model the problem as a Markov decision process and develop a novel approximate optimization approach to analyze and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. Results: We show that a use-down-to/balancing production policy and modified order-up-to ordering policy is optimal. We also propose a heuristic policy based on piece-wise linear value function approximation. Whereas computing the value function approximation via brute-force is time-consuming because of the curse of dimensionality, we leverage the structure of the optimal policy to develop an algorithm that greatly improves the computational time of the value function approximation. Our numerical studies on both a synthetic data set and real-world data show that the proposed heuristic provides significant profit improvement over three simpler straw policies, some of which are used in practice.

Different than the existing literature on this class of problems, we assume that the firm has neither prior information about the demand distribution nor the capacity distribution, and only has access to past demand and supply realizations. The supply realizations are censored capacity realizations in periods where the policy need not produce full capacity to reach its target inventory levels. If both the demand and capacity distributions were known at the beginning of the planning horizon, the well‐known target interval policies would be optimal, and the corresponding optimal cost is referred to as the clairvoyant optimal cost. When such distributional information is not available a priori to the firm, we propose a cyclic stochastic gradient descent type of algorithm whose running average cost asymptotically converges to the clairvoyant optimal cost. We prove that the rate of convergence guarantee of our algorithm is O ( 1 / T ) , which is provably tight for this class of problems.

In particular, we examine how a major U.S. airline’s price dispersion in the coach cabin changes after introducing the option to upgrade to a new type of premium economy seating within the coach cabin. We first provide a theoretical analysis that highlights two competing pressures that the new premium economy seating upgrades created on coach class prices. On the one hand, the airline benefits from lowering its prices because by allowing more customers to purchase in the first place, it increases the probability of selling upgrades (admission effect). On the other hand, for some customers, the value of flying with the airline increases because of the upgrade availability, therefore the airline may find it optimal to increase its prices (valuation effect). In the second part of the paper, we conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of upgrade introduction on coach class prices, based on a proprietary transaction-level data set from a major U.S. airline company. The empirical analysis tests the main predictions of our theoretical model and examines further nuances. The results show that the introduction of the premium economy seating upgrades is associated with an increase in the price dispersion and revenues in the coach class, the admission effect is stronger than the valuation effect on the low end of the price distribution, and the opposite is true on the high end of the price distribution. Finally, we discuss implications of our results for firm revenues and consumer welfare.

e11b783466aea428cd725d4b6b412f80a5762404,Izak Duenyas,Who Benefits When Prescription Drug Manufacturers Offer Co-Pay Coupons,"The rising cost of prescription drugs is a concern in the United States. To manage drug costs, insurance companies induce patients to choose less-expensive medications by making them pay higher copayments for more-expensive drugs, especially when multiple drug options are available to treat a condition. However, drug manufacturers have responded by offering copay coupons—coupons intended to be used by those already with prescription drug coverage. Recent empirical work has shown that such coupons significantly increase insurer costs without much benefit to patients, who incur lower out-of-pocket expenses with coupons but may eventually see higher costs passed to them. As a result, there is pressure from the insurance industry and consumer advocacy groups to ban copay coupons. In this paper we analyze how copay coupons affect patients, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers, while addressing the question of whether insurance companies would in fact always benefit from a copay coupon ban. We find that copay coupons tend to benefit drug manufacturers with large profit margins relative to other manufacturers, while generally, but not always, benefiting patients; insurer costs tend to increase with coupons from high-price drug manufacturers and decrease with coupons from low-price manufacturers. Although often helping drug manufacturers and increasing insurer costs, we also identify situations in which copay coupons benefit both patients and insurers. Thus, a blanket ban on copay coupons would not necessarily benefit insurance companies. In addition to the policy implications of our work, we make concrete managerial recommendations to insurers. We discuss how they should set formulary selection policies taking into account the fact that drug manufacturers may offer coupons; and we suggest how they can benefit from subsidizing coupons from drug manufacturers with low-price drugs, or from having drug manufacturers compete on price, to receive a favorable formulary position (i.e., copay).

After a consumer makes a reservation for a product (e.g., a hotel room), she is asked whether she would like to upgrade her product to a higher-quality (more expensive) one at a discounted price. The upgrade, however, is not fulfilled immediately. The firm fulfills upgrades at check-in if higher-quality products are still available, and the upgrade fee is charged to the consumer if and only if she actually gets upgraded. Consumers decide which product type to book and whether to accept an upgrade offer or not based on the anticipated upgrade probability. We find that conditional upgrades create value by improving demand–supply matching for the firm. The firm can use the conditional upgrade channel to flexibly manage capacity allocations and reoptimize demand segmentation. For a firm that takes product prices as given, offering conditional upgrades is effective in compensating for the firm’s lack of ability in setting prices optimally. For a firm that has the ability to optimize product prices, conditional upgrades generate higher revenues than dynamic pricing.

The firm decides whether to unbundle the ancillary service from the main service and charge separate prices for different service components. We study the interaction between the optimal ancillary unbundling strategy and the firm’s use of main service price discrimination by analyzing two types of firms: firms that use uniform pricing of main service and firms that use discriminatory pricing of main service. We find that a uniform-pricing (respectively, discriminatory-pricing) firm should unbundle the ancillary service if the fraction of high-type consumers who value the ancillary service is large (respectively, small) enough. The difference hinges on the rationale that under uniform pricing, unbundling allows the firm to extract more ancillary surplus from high-type consumers; by contrast, under discriminatory pricing, bundling allows the firm to extract more ancillary surplus from consumers. Moreover, we find that unbundling the ancillary service and using main service price discrimination are strategic complements (respectively, strategic substitutes) if the correlation between consumers’ main service valuations and ancillary service valuations is low (respectively, high).

The test auction reveals incumbent supplier cost information that helps the buyer determine how many entrants (if any) to recruit at a cost prior to awarding the remaining units. The optimal number of entrant suppliers to recruit follows a threshold policy that is monotonic in the test auction’s clearing price unless the underlying supplier cost distribution is not regular. When setting her reserve price in the test auction, the buyer uses supplier recruitment as her “outside option”: if the reserve price is not met in the test auction, the buyer recruits new suppliers and runs a second auction. We compare the attractiveness of the test auction procedure relative to the more conventional procedure in which the buyer auctions off her entire demand in one auction. Since the buyer can choose ex ante which procedure to use, we propose using whichever has lower ex ante total (purchase plus recruitment) cost. Finally, using an optimal mechanism analysis, we find a lower bound on the buyer’s cost, and use that cost as a benchmark to show that our proposed sourcing strategy performs well given its ease of implementation.

In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem of a profit maximizing service firm that dynamically allocates its resources toward acquiring new clients and retaining unsatisfied existing ones. The interaction between acquisition and retention in our model is reflected in the cash constraint on total expected spending on acquisition and retention in each period. We formulate this problem as a dynamic program in which the firm makes decisions in both acquisition and retention after observing the current size of its customer base and receiving information about customers in danger of attrition, and we characterize the structure of the optimal acquisition and retention strategy. We show that when the firm's customer base size is relatively low, the firm should spend heavily on acquisition and try to retain every unhappy customer. However, as its customer base grows, the firm should gradually shift its emphasis from acquisition to retention, and it should also aim to strike a balance between acquisition and retention while spending its available resources. Finally, when the customer base is large enough, it may be optimal for the firm to begin spending less in both acquisition and retention. We also extend our analysis to situations where acquisition or retention success rate, as a function of resources allocation, is uncertain and show that the optimal acquisition and retention policy can be surprisingly complex. However, we develop an effective heuristic for that case. This paper aims to provide service managers some analytical principles and effective guidelines on resource allocation between these two significant activities based on their firm's customer base size.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12559,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12559,2016.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Dynamic Customer Acquisition and Retention,Dynamic Customer Acquisition and Retention Management,10.1111/poms.12559,,Goal 1,0.01515964830873006,False,

Despite the potential benefits of dynamic pricing, many sellers still adopt a static pricing policy because of (1) the complexity of frequent reoptimizations, (2) the negative perception of excessive price adjustments, and (3) the lack of flexibility caused by existing business constraints. In this paper, we develop a family of pricing heuristics that can be used to address all these challenges. Our heuristic is computationally easy to implement; it requires only a single optimization at the beginning of the selling season and automatically adjusts the prices over time. Moreover, to guarantee a strong revenue performance, the heuristic only needs to adjust the prices of a small number of products and do so infrequently. This property helps the seller focus his effort on the prices of the most important products instead of all products. In addition, in the case where not all products are equally admissible to price adjustment (due to existing business constraints such as contractual agreement, strategic product positioning, etc.), our heuristic can immediately substitute the price adjustment of the original products with the price adjustment of similar products and maintain an equivalent revenue performance. This property provides the seller with extra flexibility in managing his prices.

We investigate how the supplier can take advantage of the buyer's better forecasts and what kind of contracts he should offer to the buyer in order to maximize his profits. We model a natural forecast evolution where the buyer can obtain a more accurate forecast closer to the selling season. We assume there is information asymmetry between the buyer and the supplier at all times in that the buyer understands her demand better than the supplier. Three types of contracts that the supplier can offer are considered: (1) one where a contract is offered before the buyer has a chance to obtain improved forecasts, (2) one where a contract is offered after the buyer has obtained improved forecasts, and (3) a contingent (dynamic) contract which offers an initial contract to the buyer before she obtains improved forecasts, followed by a later contract (contingent on the initial contract) offered after improved forecasts have been obtained. We consider two scenarios: (1) where the supplier is certain that the buyer can obtain more accurate forecasts over time, and (2) where the supplier is uncertain about the buyer's forecasting capability (or forecasting cost). In the first scenario, we show that among the three types of contracts, the contingent contract is always the most profitable for the supplier. Furthermore, using the contingent contract, the supplier always benefits from higher accuracy of the buyer's demand forecasts.

The dedicated production lines and the shared resource for calibration face capacity uncertainties. The firm holds inventory of products that are not yet calibrated and carries out calibration when an order is received. We analyze a multiperiod inventory model for two products and derive the optimal production policy at stage 1 as well as the optimal allocation of the shared resource to demands at stage 2. For the shared resource, because of its capacity uncertainty, not only the total planned production quantities matter, but also the sequence in which the products are processed. We characterize the optimal allocation of the shared resource and show that the optimal policy keeps the ending inventories of products as close to a so-called “target path” as possible. For the dedicated production lines, because of their capacity uncertainty, the optimal production policy depends on the initial inventories. We identify and characterize the structural properties of the optimal production policy. Through a numerical study, we explore how the presence of finite shared capacity influences the inventory targets. We find that the behavior may be counterintuitive: when multiple products share a finite capacity in stage 2, the inventory target for the product having a larger dedicated production capacity or less capacity variability in stage 1 can be higher than the other product.

Opens a new window","Promotions for digital goods have typically focused on enticing users to hasten their consumption. Here, the authors investigate a novel deceleration-incentivizing promotional policy, “wait for free” (WFF), applied to serialized digital content—sequences of interconnected episodes—monetized via episode-level paywalls. Specifically, customers can sample early episodes of promoted series for free, and can continue to watch for free by waiting a prespecified time; those unwilling to wait can pay to view episodes right away. WFF can draw users to start viewing a promoted series, and it generates revenue through two sources: impatient users opting to pay to consume the next episode immediately, and additional users continuing through the free episodes to watch paid-only episodes at the end. The authors analyze large-scale viewership data from a platform that enacted WFF for digital comics. A comic-level difference-in-differences analysis provides robust evidence that WFF boosts paid viewership for the promoted series, and the degree of lift varies by user type and over time. A more granular episode-level analysis incorporating intercomic spillovers and promotional lift heterogeneity suggests that WFF can boost net-of-cannibalization revenue at the platform level: Specifically, the model-optimized set of promoted comics performs roughly 18% better than the firm-enacted one and 25% better than the no-promotion baseline; furthermore, WFF and paid-only episodes each receive nontrivial degrees of lift, 70% and 59% respectively.",Crossref,80.7017543859649,10.1177/00222437241270194,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437241270194,2024.0,Journal of Marketing Research,ok,CR-title:Wait for free: A consumption-decelerating promotion for serialized digital media,Wait for Free: A Consumption-Decelerating Promotion for Serialized Digital Media,10.1177/00222437241270194,,Goal 4,0.015541870998591,False,

2755d2f459c7e3aa958c3f8a28ddfee033eedb35,Fred Feinberg,"Strategic new product media planning under emergent channel substitution and synergy 
Opens a new window","New product and service introductions require careful joint planning of production and marketing campaigns. Consequently, they typically utilize multiple information channels to stimulate customer awareness and resultant word‐of‐mouth (WOM), availing of standard budget allocation tools. By contrast, when enacting strategic allocation decisions—which must align with other management imperatives—dividing expenditures across channels is far more complex. To this end, we formulate a multichannel demand model for new products (or services), amenable to analysis of inter‐ and intrachannel interaction patterns and with the WOM process, without building such interactions directly into the modeling framework. To address the notorious complexity of media planning over time, we propose a novel decomposition of the multichannel dynamic programming problem into two distinct “tiers”: the strategic tier addresses how to allocate total expenditure across channels, while the tactical tier studies how to allocate the channel‐specific budgets (determined in the strategic tier) over time periods. This decomposition enables optimal media strategies to sidestep the curse of dimensionality and renders the model pragmatically estimable. Strategic tier analysis suggests a variety of novel insights, primarily that funds should not be allocated based on (relative) channel effectiveness alone but also systematically aligned with WOM generation. Specifically, each channel can face a “chasm‐crossing” threshold, abruptly transitioning the adoption process from lead‐users to mass‐market penetration. Moreover, the model provides actionable managerial insights into when, and which, channel interactions are synergistic versus substitutive. Specifically, a channel's interactions are governed primarily by its own “leverage” (potential demand impact) and the WOM‐based demand “momentum” (market penetration) it can generate, affording a novel basis for channel typography and firm action. The modeling framework is illustrated by examining camera sales for two media channels (free‐standing inserts and radio) and their effects over 28 months. We use Bayesian machinery to estimate a highly flexible diffusion‐based model, along with forecasts, media plans, and both theoretical and empirically‐based qualitative insights.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.13670,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13670,2022.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Strategic new product media planning under emergent channel substitution and syn,Strategic new product media planning under emergent channel substitution and synergy,10.1111/poms.13670,,Goal 12,0.01309730025951169,False,

Market viability demands that product–service combinations be compatible across multiple producers and service channels, and that the producers’ profitability must include both service and product design. Some services may be delivered contractually or physically, through a wider range of products than others. Thus, optimization of producers’ contingent products, services, and channel decisions becomes a combined decision problem. This article examines three common product–service design scenarios: exclusive , non-exclusive asymmetric , and non-exclusive symmetric . An enterprise-wide decision framework has been proposed to optimize integrated services and products for each scenario. Optimization results provide guidelines for strategies that are mutually profitable for partner–competitor firms.

A key concern for advertisers is not only whether some consumers display degrees of “wearout” but also whether they can surpass a point at which additional exposures have a negative marginal effect: “weariness.” The authors examine a large-scale advertising campaign aimed at driving viewers to a target website, which comprises more than 12,000 users across over 400 websites. These data are analyzed using a flexible discrete mixture specification that accommodates different response shapes over ad stock and timing and parcels ad viewers into response classes based on their internet usage metrics. The resulting classes display varying degrees of wearout, with one subgroup, accounting for about 24% of the sample, evincing weariness. The model also estimates differential publisher effectiveness, with the most effective publisher being nine times more effective than the one 26 places down. The authors demonstrate that the finding of weariness is robust to all the model’s main components, with one key exception: heterogeneity in users’ ad response.

Accordingly, we introduce a conceptual framework to classify different aspects of individuals’ decisions in the presence of multiple goals. Based on this framework, we propose a formalization of individual decision-making when pursuing multiple goals. We briefly review different previous streams on goal-based decision-making and how the proposed goal-driven conceptual framework relates to earlier research in discrete choice models.

Opens a new window","Experimental methods are critical tools in marketing, psychology, and economics to isolate the effects of key variables from vagaries intrinsic to field data. As such, they are often considered exempt from the sort of sample selectivity artifacts widely documented in empirical research, in part because participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions. To conserve time and resources, experiments often focus on items participants have chosen or are familiar with, for example, postchoice satisfaction ratings, certain free recall tasks, or specifying consideration sets preceding brand choice. When consumer input even partially influences the items about which researchers request subsequent data, the potential for item selectivity arises. In such situations, analyses are contingent on both the choice context(s) of the experiment and the alternatives participants elect to evaluate, potentially leading to substantial item selectivity overall and to differing degrees across conditions. We examine situations in which a nonignorable “choose one of many” (polytomous) selection process limits which items offer up subsequent information, and develop methods to allow substantive results to pertain to the full set of items, not only those selected. The framework is illustrated via two experiments in which participants choose and then evaluate a frequently purchased consumer good as well as data first examined by Ratner et al. [Ratner RK, Kahn BE, Kahneman D (1999) Choosing less-preferred experiences for the sake of variety. J. Consumer Res. 26(1):1–15]. Results indicate substantial item selectivity that, when corrected for, can lead to markedly different interpretations of focal variable effects, such as large effect size changes and even sign reversal. Moreover, failing to flexibly account for item selectivity across experimental conditions, even in well-designed experimental settings, can lead to inaccurate substantive inferences about consumers’ evaluative criteria. We further demonstrate robustness to theoretically driven (but not overtly misspecified) selection rules and provide researchers with a simple, “two-step” exploratory procedure akin to a “control function” approach—involving just one additional variable added to standard models—to determine whether and to what degree item selectivity may be affecting their substantive results.

We study the role of network effects and platform differentiation in the context of a merger between the two largest platforms for pet-sitting services. To obtain causal estimates of network effects, we leverage geographic variation in premerger market shares and employ a difference-in-differences approach. Our results reveal that although users of the acquiring platform benefit from the merger thanks to network effects, those of the acquired platform are comparatively worse off because their preferred option is removed. Network effects and differentiation offset each other such that at the market level, users are not substantially better off with a combined platform than with two separate platforms.

Building on the literature on gendered organizations and organizational design, we develop opposing perspectives on these relationships. To arbitrate between these perspectives, we first conduct a field experiment in partnership with a hiring firm. We find that featuring a flatter hierarchy in recruiting materials does not significantly affect the size of the applicant pool, but significantly decreases women's representation within it. Our follow‐up survey experiment identifies several potential mechanisms (e.g., perceptions of career progression, informality, workload, and fit). Our findings imply that firms' growing tendency to adopt flatter hierarchies could inadvertently undermine efforts to attract a greater proportion of women applicants. Managerial Summary Using a pair of labor market experiments, this study finds that characterizing a hiring firm's hierarchy as “flatter” with fewer management levels reduces women's representation in the applicant pool. We show that this decrease in the share of women applicants is likely driven by the fact that women, compared to men, perceive flatter hierarchies as more likely to present difficulties in fitting in, burden them with more work, and provide fewer opportunities for career progression. These findings suggest that, to mitigate workplace gender segregation, organizations with flatter structures may benefit from de‐emphasizing their organizational hierarchies in recruitment efforts.

Opens a new window","This paper investigates how organizational misconduct is perpetuated through intergenerational transmission. We theorize that early exposure to a subculture of misconduct imprints newcomers with the belief that misconduct is normal, which is then carried by these individuals into managerial positions and passed down to their subordinates. We test this using longitudinal administrative data from the Chicago Police Department from 1980 to 2017. We exploit a lottery that assigns applicants to training cohorts to demonstrate that officers exposed early on to a subculture of misconduct not only engage in more misconduct over their entire careers, but also increase the misconduct of their subordinates after they become managers. We also find that this intergenerational dynamic is stronger when subordinate officers were exposed to a subculture of misconduct themselves, are earlier in their tenure, and have not yet received their annual review from their manager. Taken together, these findings reveal a bottom-up dynamic whereby beliefs about misconduct are developed in an organization’s lowest ranks, carried by these individuals over time, and passed down to future generations. This study expands our understanding of how organizational misconduct is perpetuated as well as offers important policy implications for addressing the problem of police misconduct.

We theorize that enforceable noncompetes increase frictions in the labor market by increasing uncertainty and recruitment costs and by curtailing entrepreneurship. We find that in state-industry combinations with a higher incidence and enforceability of noncompetes, workers—including those unconstrained by noncompetes—receive relatively fewer job offers, have reduced mobility, and experience lower wages. The results offer policymakers a reason to restrict noncompetes beyond axiomatic appeals to a worker’s “freedom of contract” and highlight labor market frictions that may impact firm-level human capital strategies.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/orsc.2018.1252,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2018.1252,2019.0,Organization Science,ok,CR-title:Mobility Constraint Externalities Opens a new window,Mobility Constraint Externalities,10.1287/orsc.2018.1252,,Goal 8,0.03243796983906214,False,

The Role of the Government-Appointed Corporate Monitor","We study the role of a relatively new type of external monitor: a government-appointed Corporate Monitor, and assess whether such appointments reduce firms’ propensity to violate laws. Using a sample of deferred and non-prosecution agreements, we first document the determinants of Monitor-appointment. We find firms that voluntarily disclose wrongdoing and have more independent directors are less likely to have Corporate Monitors, whereas those with more severe infractions, mandated board changes, and increased cooperation requirements are more likely to have Monitors. Controlling for these determinants of Monitorappointment, we find such appointments reduce violations of the law by 18%–25%. However, we find little evidence the effect persists after the Monitorship ends. Overall, our results suggest that although Corporate Monitors are effective on-site, they are less successful in changing firms’ long-term behavior.

Using recently-developed mixed data sampling methods, we find that the aggregate is tilted towards firms with smoother earnings and that this composition of aggregate earnings outperforms traditional weighting schemes. Further, this tilted aggregate has a stronger positive association with forecast revisions; in fact, analysts who utilize earnings the most in their forecasts appear to fully impound the informativeness of earnings smoothness.

Opens a new window","In nascent industries―whose new technologies are often poorly understood by regulators―contending with regulatory uncertainty can be crucial to organizational survival and growth. Prior research on nonmarket strategy has largely focused on established firms in mature industries, but such strategies are apt to differ for new ventures, which generally have limited resources and market power and operate in novel domains in which the rules of the game are underdeveloped. How do new ventures navigate regulatory uncertainty? To explore this question, we conduct an inductive, multi-case research study of five ventures that pioneered the nascent personal-genomics industry. Drawing on extensive qualitative data, we develop an emergent theoretical framework that elucidates how ventures navigate evolving regulatory uncertainty. Grounded in a power versus industry-evolution logic, this framework illuminates how ventures’ strategies for doing so vary and theorizes why certain strategies appear more effective than others. In doing so, we also introduce a novel logic of interaction— regulatory co-creation—that ventures can employ to shape emerging regulations. Taken together, our theory and findings challenge existing perspectives on strategy in nascent industries, shed light on the dynamic interplay between market and nonmarket strategy, and recast the relationship between ventures and regulators during the emergence of new technology industries.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/00018392221112641,https://doi.org/10.1177/00018392221112641,2022.0,Administrative Science Quarterly,ok,CR-title:Shaping Nascent Industries: Innovation Strategy and Regulatory Uncertainty in Pe,Shaping Nascent Industries: Innovation Strategy and Regulatory Uncertainty in Personal Genomics,10.1177/00018392221112641,,Goal 9,0.01858346639788973,False,

Opens a new window","Hierarchy conflict, a dispute among members over the rank order of influence in the team, often impairs team processes and outcomes. The current literature often operates from the assumption that self-interest must be high when team members engage in hierarchy conflict. Building on interdependence theory, we propose that hierarchy conflict may also occur when members have a more prosocial motivation, leading to a more constructive expression of the hierarchy conflict and more positive effects on team performance than hierarchy conflict instigated by members with a more proself motivation. Specifically, we argue that the extent to which a team member is more driven by prosocial (versus proself) motivation heightens the threshold and lowers the frequency for engaging in a hierarchy conflict and that more prosocially motivated team members express their challenge of the hierarchy more directly and with less intensity than more proself-motivated members. This sets in motion a hierarchy conflict exchange that is more constructive and helps teams perform better compared with hierarchy conflict instigated by proself motivation. Our theory complements and extends the current study of the causes, expressions, and consequences of hierarchy conflict in teams across multiple levels of analysis and helps redirect the focus of how hierarchy conflict is viewed in the literature.",Crossref,81.203007518797,10.1287/orsc.2023.17976,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17976,2024.0,Organization Science,ok,"CR-title:Hierarchy conflict: Causes, expressions, and consequences Opens a new window","Hierarchy Conflict: Causes, Expressions, and Consequences",10.1287/orsc.2023.17976,,Goal 16,0.06888467393242194,True,conflict prevention; conflict resolution

Opens a new window","Increasing the social category diversity of work teams is top of mind for many organizations. However, such efforts may not always be sufficiently resourced, given the numerous resource demands facing organizations. In this paper, we offer a novel take on the relationship between social category diversity and team performance, seeking to understand the role resources may play in both altering and explaining the performance dynamics of diverse teams. Specifically, our resource framework explains how the effects of social category diversity on team performance can be explained by intrateam resource cognitions and behaviors and are dependent on team resource availability. We propose that in the face of scarcity in a focal resource (i.e., budget), diverse (but not homogenous) teams generalize this scarcity perception to fear that all resources (i.e., staff, time, etc.) are scarce, prompting performance-detracting power struggles over resources within the team. We find support for our model in three multimethod team-level studies, including two laboratory studies of interacting teams and a field study of work teams in research and development firms. Our resource framework provides a new lens to study the success or failure of diverse teams by illuminating a previously overlooked danger in diverse teams (negative resource cognitions (scarcity spillover bias) and behaviors (intrateam power struggles)), which offers enhanced explanatory power over prior explanations.

We draw on the perceived diversity literature, hypothesizing that collectivistic norms cause group members to blur demographic differences, resulting in perceptions that group members are more similar than they actually are. Whether this benefits or harms group performance depends on the group’s objective diversity and the relevance of the perceived diversity attribute for accomplishing the task. For conjunctive tasks, the group’s performance is determined by its weakest member, demanding high levels of cohesion. Our theory suggests that collectivism benefits group conjunctive performance when objective national diversity is high by blurring divisive relational differences but has no effect in groups with low objective national diversity. In contrast, for disjunctive tasks, the group’s performance is determined by its best member. We predict that collectivism harms group disjunctive performance when objective expertness diversity is high by blurring differences in task-relevant expertness but has no effect in low objective expertness diversity groups. We find support for our theory in two studies, an archival study of 5,214 Himalayan climbing expeditions and a laboratory experiment assessing 366 groups.

Our review concludes that perceived self‐to‐team dissimilarity and perceived subgroup splits mostly have been linked to negative effects for individuals and groups, whereas perceived group heterogeneity has been shown to exert both positive and negative effects on group outcomes.

Providing a contemporary take on the classical question “if it’s legal is it ethical?”, David Hess explores the role of the law in promoting or hindering stakeholder-oriented purpose and governance structure. Jeffrey Harrison encourages scholars to move beyond the presupposition that businesses are either strategic or ethical and explore important questions at the intersection of strategy and ethics. The proposition that business models might be inherently ethical or inherently unethical in their design is developed by Sheila Killian, who examines business systems, their morality, and who they serve. However, the conundrum that entrepreneurs are either lauded for their self-belief and risk-taking, or loathed for their self-belief and risk-taking, is discussed by M.

Over 25 million people are in forced labor, with many of those people directly or indirectly involved in the production of goods sold in the U.S. through multinational corporations’ supply chains. Corporations benefit from modern slavery and their business practices are often one of its root causes, which is why modern slavery persists despite a societal repulsion to the practice. To hold corporations accountable for their efforts to ensure they are not linked to modern slavery, governments, such as the state of California and the United Kingdom, have relied on mandatory disclosures requirements. This Article shows that such transparency initiatives are ineffective, and despite attempts to improve on their shortcomings, they will continue to be ineffective for achieving corporate accountability. This ineffectiveness results from corporations approaching transparency as an end in itself, with the production of disclosures being disconnected from operational changes.

Protecting such workers must be a primary policy goal in the efforts to “build back better” from the crisis, and businesses conducting human rights due diligence (HRDD) is a primary means to do so. In Europe, there is a fast‐moving trend toward legislatively mandating HRDD, and there is potential for similar movement in the United States. Whether HRDD will significantly improve human rights conditions, however, is an open question. Based on our experience with corporate compliance programs, it is clear that the management and oversight of HRDD is an essential factor in ensuring meaningful implementation, as opposed to corporations focusing on form over substance. This article identifies those key internal governance issues and provides advice on how best to ensure effective implementation. The article argues that for most corporations, the day‐to‐day management of HRDD best fits with the compliance function—not the legal function—and this new role could be part of the next step in the evolution of the compliance function. This article also discusses the role of the board of directors and how HRDD combined with recent developments in the law of fiduciary duties can push directors to engage in more rigorous oversight.

The primary focus is on “general” transparency programs, such as the inclusion of human rights issues in sustainability reports. Regulators increasingly rely on such programs, such as through the EU Directive on the Disclosure of Non-financial Information, which many commentators view as a model for legislation in other countries and for a business and human rights treaty. This article identifies several problems with this approach. The human rights metrics used in current sustainability reporting standards, and in practice, often lack validity or are based upon data that is most easily collected, rather than most important. Moreover, the empirical evidence on sustainability reporting shows continued problems of selective disclosure, impression management, incomparable disclosures, and the use of disclosure as an end in itself (as opposed to a process that leads to organizational change). To move forward, regulators should shift focus to a model grounded in regulatory pluralism. Under this approach, regulators would combine a selection of targeted transparency mechanisms to create a more complete regulatory system that corrects for one disclosure mechanism’s weaknesses by including other mechanisms that have complementary strengths.",Semantic Scholar,100.0,10.1111/ablj.12134,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b43bbdf1a96b4968d5e9d200e04a1be61c65859,2018.0,American Business Law Journal,ok,CR-title:The Transparency Trap: Non-Financial Disclosure and the Responsibility of Busine,The Transparency Trap: Non-Financial Disclosure and the Responsibility of Business to Respect Human Rights,10.2139/ssrn.3300303,,Goal 16,0.0601084367206416,True,institutional transparency

Opens a new window","In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an urgent demand, not just for scientific information and advice, but also for policy proposals that helped curb the spread of the virus while minimizing economic and other collateral societal effects. The research response has been unprecedented. After just 1 year, PubMed returns more than 100,000 publications, 10 times as many as for Ebola or Zika, and nearly as many as produced in 200 years of work on influenza. Some saw the COVID-19 crisis primarily as a crisis of misinformation, following a longer trend of “truth decay” (1): that is, an array of confusing and conflicting messages that question facts, blur the line between fact and opinion, and dismiss formerly respected sources of information as merely political interests pushing a partisan agenda. The World Health Organization went so far as to warn against an “infodemic . . . an overabundance of information—some accurate and some not—that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it” (2). But, of course, the informational environment surrounding COVID-19 continues to be highly complex. Since the beginning of the pandemic, science has moved at breakneck speed and under immense public scrutiny. Influential journals published studies only to retract them a short time later. And the scientific community was faced with the dilemma of having to correct misinformation they knew to be false with science that was emerging and would continue to produce new and sometimes contradictory findings in the months to come (3). The lessons from COVID-19 leave science communication researchers and practitioners in a difficult spot. If we do not improve the scientific literacy undergirding our public and political discourse, how can we make sense of the challenging issues we face? We cannot set policy or make informed decisions as citizens if we do not agree on a common set of facts and trust a common domain of expertise to ground the conversation. At the same time, misinformation and disinformation are multifaceted phenomena. Diagnosing, understanding, and evaluating the problem and its potential solutions is complicated by a host of factors, including a fundamental transformation of our information ecology, widening partisan rifts, human tendencies toward motivated information processing, and even flawed incentives within the scientific system (4). In short, COVID-19 illustrates powerfully why building a practitioner-relevant evidence base for communicating about science and its public impacts is both more urgent and more complicated than ever. Responding directly to these complexities, this collection of articles reports on a colloquium of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine titled, “Advancing the science and practice of science communication: Misinformation about science in the public sphere.” This event was the fourth and most recent in a series of convenings devoted to the science of science communication (5–7). Beginning in May 2012, the series was designed to survey the state of empirical social science research in science communication and advance the research agenda. The 2019 iteration was designed more broadly, welcoming individuals and organizations engaged in communicating science with a variety of goals and from a variety of vantage points spanning the communities of research and practice. Participants hailed from universities, think tanks, philanthropic foundations, for-profit research organizations, professional societies, journalism and media companies, informal science education entities, health professions practices, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies.

We find that whereas precision alleviates agency conflicts as expected, observability can exacerbate agency conflicts, especially if the manager's interests are misaligned sufficiently with those of the principal.

A key highlight is that incentive compensation, performance monitoring, and the hierarchical structure (the extent to which contracting authority is delegated to the manager) are simultaneously determined. In general, we find that productivity and monitoring exhibit opposite patterns in a hierarchy. That is, at higher hierarchical levels effort incentives are higher but performance monitoring and pay-for-performance sensitivity is lower, even for agents who are otherwise comparable. For instance, we find that agents working for the agent-manager are less productive even though they are monitored more intensively than comparable agents elsewhere in the hierarchy. The flip side is that an agent-manager entrusted with authority to evaluate others is (implicitly) motivated to be more productive even though such authority reduces the need to monitor his performance.

The spillover from material weakness disclosures is evident only if a shared director has more experience with the disclosing firm or can channel more information about the disclosed material weakness. Our findings suggest that prior director experiences outside the firm influence the work of audit committees inside the firm. One rationale is that a director's prior experience with an adverse disclosure helps diffuse important insights and serves as a catalyst for improvements in a firm's internal control and financial reporting practices.

We consider a principal/multi-agent model where the principal either contracts with all parties directly or delegates part of the contracting authority to one of the agents. Delegated contracts improve risk sharing and generate implicit incentives for the agent entrusted with contracting authority. However, delegated contracts also entail a loss of control in motivating lower-level agents. In addition, when performance is aggregated, delegated contracts render agents' incentives more interdependent and create spillovers up and down the hierarchy. We demonstrate that accounting practices that aggregate the performance of multiple agents can complement organizational forms characterized by greater decentralization. In contrast, accounting practices that capture agents' performance contributions separately favor more centralized organizational forms.

The retailer makes a one-time decision on the amount of inventory to be placed at the warehouse at the beginning of the selling season, followed by periodic joint replenishment and pricing decisions for each store throughout the season. The authors first analyze the performance of two popular and simple heuristic policies that directly implement the solution of a deterministic approximation of the original stochastic problem. They show that simple reoptimization of the deterministic approximation may worsen the performance by causing a “spiraling up” movement in expected lost sales quantity. The authors further propose two improved heuristic policies with provably near-optimal performance. In particular, the first policy achieves the best possible performance among all policies that rely on static pricing, and the second policy outperforms the first one because of its use of carefully designed dynamic pricing scheme.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/opre.2022.2389,https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.2389,2024.0,Operations Research,ok,CR-title:Joint Inventory and Pricing for a One-Warehouse Multistore Problem: Spiraling Ph,"Joint Inventory and Pricing for a One-Warehouse Multistore Problem: Spiraling Phenomena, Near Optimal Policies, and the Value of Dynamic Pricing",10.1287/opre.2022.2389,,Goal 10,0.02072953421709822,False,

Despite the growing calls for algorithmic transparency, most firms keep their algorithms opaque, citing potential gaming by users that may negatively affect the algorithm’s predictive power. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to compare firm and user surplus with and without algorithmic transparency in the presence of strategic users and present novel insights. We identify a broad set of conditions under which making the algorithm transparent actually benefits the firm. We show that, in some cases, even the predictive power of the algorithm can increase if the firm makes the algorithm transparent. By contrast, users may not always be better off under algorithmic transparency. These results hold even when the predictive power of the opaque algorithm comes largely from correlational features and the cost for users to improve them is minimal. We show that these insights are robust under several extensions of the main model. Overall, our results show that firms should not always view manipulation by users as bad. Rather, they should use algorithmic transparency as a lever to motivate users to invest in more desirable features. This paper was accepted by D. J.

Under this model, customers examine the products in a decreasing order of display, from the top to (potentially) the bottom of the list. At each step, customers can decide to either purchase the current product, forego the current product and continue examining the next product, or simply terminate the search without purchasing any product. We first consider the core pricing problem, where the display position (ranking) of each product is fixed and the only decision that the firm needs to make is pricing. We then consider an extension to the problem of joint ranking and pricing in the presence of filtering options, which the customers can use to filter out some undesirable products. For both problems, we develop Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based joint learning and optimization algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. The key challenge here is in constructing a UCB algorithm that exploits the structure of the Cascade Click model while at the same time taking into account all of the historical click and purchase information. Our numerical results yield three key insights. First, naively applying a standard black box UCB algorithm without adapting it to the Cascade structure is very inefficient and results in a huge loss in total revenues during a finite horizon. Second, applying a learning algorithm by assuming a mis-specified model that ignores the Cascade behavior may result in a highly suboptimal solution. Third, jointly optimizing ranking and pricing can significantly improve performance. Thus, although in practice these decisions are sometimes made separately due to organizational structure, our results suggest that a significant benefit can be realized when the two decisions are more closely coordinated.

There is a finite selling horizon and no replenishment opportunity. In each period, the retailer needs to decide how to “frame” (i.e., display, rank, price) each product on his or her website as well as how to fulfill a new demand. Academic/practical relevance: E-commerce retail is known to suffer from thin profit margins. Using the data from a major U.S. retailer, we show that jointly planning product framing and order fulfillment can have a significant impact on online retailers’ profitability. This is a technically challenging problem as it involves both inventory and cardinality constraints. In this paper, we make progress toward resolving this challenge. Methodology: We use techniques such as randomized algorithms and graph-based algorithms to provide a tractable solution heuristic that we analyze through asymptotic analysis. Results: Our proposed randomized heuristic policy is based on the solution of a deterministic approximation to the stochastic control problem. The key challenge is in constructing a randomization scheme that is easy to implement and that guarantees the resulting policy is asymptotically optimal. We propose a novel two-step randomization scheme based on the idea of matrix decomposition and a rescaling argument. Managerial implications: Our numerical tests show that the proposed policy is very close to optimal, can be applied to large-scale problems in practice, and highlights the value of jointly optimizing product framing and order fulfillment decisions. When inventory across the network is imbalanced, the widespread practice of planning product framing without considering its impact on fulfillment can result in high shipping costs, regardless of the fulfillment policy used. Our proposed policy significantly reduces shipping costs by using product framing to manage demand so that it occurs close to the location of the inventory.",Crossref,95.49549549549549,10.1287/msom.2021.1012,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.1012,2022.0,Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management,ok,"CR-title:Joint Product Framing (Display, Ranking, Pricing) and Order Fulfillment under th","Joint Product Framing (Display, Ranking, Pricing) and Order Fulfillment Under the Multinomial Logit Model for E-Commerce Retailers",10.1287/msom.2021.1012,,Goal 9,0.00871001279944739,False,

In our problem, some customers are patient, and they are willing to wait in the system for several periods to make a purchase until the price is lower than their valuation. The seller does not know the joint distribution of customers’ valuation and patience level a priori and can only learn this from the realized total sales in every period. Academic/practical relevance: The revenue management problem with patient customers has been studied in the literature as an optimization problem, and cyclic policy has been shown to be optimal in some cases. We contribute to the literature by studying this problem from the joint learning and optimization perspective. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work that studies online learning and optimization for multiperiod pricing with patient customers. Methodology: We introduce new dynamic programming formulations for this problem, and we develop two nontrivial upper confidence bound–based learning algorithms. Results: We analyze both decreasing cyclic policies and so-called threshold-regulated policies, which contain both the decreasing cyclic policies and the nested decreasing cyclic policies. We show that our learning algorithms for these policies converge to the optimal clairvoyant decreasing cyclic policy and threshold-regulated policy at a near-optimal rate. Managerial implications: Our proposed algorithms perform significantly better than benchmark algorithms that either ignore the patient customer characteristic or simply use the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, which does not encourage enough exploration; this highlights the importance of “smart learning” in the context of data-driven decision making. In addition, our numerical results also show that combining our algorithms with smart estimation methods, such as linear interpolation or least square estimation, can significantly improve their empirical performance; this highlights the benefit of combining smart learning with smart estimation, which further increases the practical viability of the algorithms.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.3144018,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5842edaa1f889461247934645be37f2044fd48f5,2018.0,Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Online Learning and Optimization of (Some) Cyclic Pricing Policies for Revenue M,Online Learning and Optimization of (Some) Cyclic Pricing Policies for Revenue Management with Patient Customers,10.2139/ssrn.3144018,,Goal 4,0.02349360141890155,False,

For the problem where the number of selling periods and initial capacity are scaled by [Formula: see text], it is known that the expected revenue loss of any non-anticipating pricing policy is [Formula: see text]. However, there is a considerable gap between this theoretical lower bound and the performance bound of the best-known heuristic control in the literature.

This is the tightest bound of its kind for the problem setting that we consider in this paper, and it significantly improves the performance bound of existing heuristic controls in the literature.

It is constructed using a linear programming relaxation of the original stochastic control formulation. In contrast to most of the existing literature, we consider a finite-horizon problem with multiple actions and time-dependent (i.e. nonstationary) upper bound on the number of bandits that can be activated at each time period; indeed, our analysis can also be applied in the setting with nonstationary transition matrix and nonstationary cost function. The asymptotic setting is obtained by letting the number of bandits and other related parameters grow to infinity. Our main contribution is that the asymptotic optimality of RAC in this general setting does not require indexability properties or the usual stability conditions of the underlying Markov chain (e.g. unichain) or fluid approximation (e.g. global stable attractor). Moreover, our multi-action setting is not restricted to the usual dominant action concept. Finally, we show that RAC is also asymptotically optimal for a dynamic population, where bandits can randomly arrive and depart the system.",Semantic Scholar,88.60759493670886,10.1017/apr.2019.29,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cbbc6ff65197ee166517a8fbbb6c9cd4d52cb00,2017.0,Advances in Applied Probability,ok,CR-title:An Asymptotically Optimal Heuristic for General Nonstationary Finite-Horizon Res,An Asymptotically Optimal Heuristic for General Non-Stationary Finite-Horizon Restless Multi-Armed Multi-Action Bandits,10.2139/ssrn.2929107,,Goal 13,0.01157522488816585,False,

In the first stage, we build a hidden Markov model to capture how gamers' latent engagement state evolves as a function of their game-play experience and outcome and the relationship between their engagement state and game-play behavior. We estimate the model using a data set containing detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers' playing histories over 29 months. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of achievement and need for challenge. For example, a higher per-period total score (achievement) increases the engagement of gamers in a low or high engagement state but not those in a medium engagement state; gamers in a low or medium engagement state enjoy within-period score variation (challenge), but those in a high engagement state do not. In the second stage, we develop a matching algorithm that learns (predicts) the gamer's current engagement state on the fly and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4%–8% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company.",Crossref,94.38202247191012,10.1287/isre.2019.0839,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2019.0839,2019.0,Information Systems Research,ok,CR-title:“Level Up”: Leveraging Skill and Engagement to Maximize Player Retention in Onli,“Level Up”: Leveraging Skill and Engagement to Maximize Player Game-Play in Online Video Games,10.1287/isre.2019.0839,,Goal 17,0.01549227617438805,False,
93b5c1638f8468bdab1cb00f20edd2e781ef6d0e,Stefanus Jasin,Analysis of Deterministic Control and Its Improvements for an Inventory Problem with Multi-Product Batch Differentiation,"We consider a multiperiod planning problem faced by a biopharmaceutical firm that must coordinate the production and allocation of batches of intermediate products to end products for multiple markets. This is a challenging problem to solve optimally, so we derive a theoretical bound on the performance of a deterministic control (DC) in which all random variables are replaced by their expected values and the corresponding deterministic optimization problem is solved. This is a variant of an approach that is widely used in practice. We show that while DC can perform poorly in some instances, simple reoptimizations of DC (i.e., certainty equivalent control (CEC)) improve the performance of DC. That said, the benefit of reoptimization decreases as the magnitude of demand variation increases. To address this, and also to provide guidance for heuristic design, we derive performance bounds for two additional heuristic controls—(1) open-loop feedback control (OLFC), which reoptimizes a sequence of stochastic programs with a complete demand distribution information, and (2) multipoint approximation control (MPAC), which solves a dynamic program using an approximate demand distribution that incorporates slightly more distributional information beyond simple expected values. We show that although OLFC outperforms CEC, its improvement can be limited. On the other hand, with carefully chosen approximate demand distributions, MPAC can significantly outperform OLFC. This suggests that, in our setting, fully capturing decision dynamics coupled with a small amount of additional distributional information beyond expected values is more useful than fully capturing the demand distribution but coupling that with insufficient modeling of decision dynamics.

The e-tailer faces a joint pricing and fulfillment (JPF) optimization problem: at the beginning of each period, the e-tailer needs to jointly decide the price for each product and how to fulfill an incoming order (i.e., from which warehouse to ship the order). The objective of the e-tailer is to maximize its total expected profits defined as total expected revenues minus total expected shipping costs. (All other costs are fixed in this problem.) The exact optimal policy for JPF is difficult to solve; so, we propose two heuristic controls that have provably good performance compared to reasonable benchmarks. Our first heuristic control directly uses the solution of a deterministic approximation of JPF as its control parameters. Our second heuristic control improves the first one by adaptively adjusting the original control parameters according to the realized demand. An important feature of the second heuristic control is that it decouples the real-time pricing and fulfillment decisions, making it easy to implement.

Despite the potential benefits of dynamic pricing, many sellers still adopt a static pricing policy because of (1) the complexity of frequent reoptimizations, (2) the negative perception of excessive price adjustments, and (3) the lack of flexibility caused by existing business constraints. In this paper, we develop a family of pricing heuristics that can be used to address all these challenges. Our heuristic is computationally easy to implement; it requires only a single optimization at the beginning of the selling season and automatically adjusts the prices over time. Moreover, to guarantee a strong revenue performance, the heuristic only needs to adjust the prices of a small number of products and do so infrequently. This property helps the seller focus his effort on the prices of the most important products instead of all products. In addition, in the case where not all products are equally admissible to price adjustment (due to existing business constraints such as contractual agreement, strategic product positioning, etc.), our heuristic can immediately substitute the price adjustment of the original products with the price adjustment of similar products and maintain an equivalent revenue performance. This property provides the seller with extra flexibility in managing his prices.

The challenge faced by the retailer is to construct a fulfillment policy to decide from which facility each of the items in the arriving order should be fulfilled, in a way that minimizes the expected total shipping costs of fulfilling customer orders over a finite horizon. Shipping costs are linear in the size of the package shipped as well as the distance from the facility to the customer. We approximate the stochastic control formulation, which is computationally intractable, with a deterministic linear program (DLP) whose size is polynomial in the size of the input. We then study the performance of two fulfillment heuristics derived from the solution of the DLP. The first heuristic implements the solution of the DLP as fulfillment probability for each item. Since fulfillment decision for each item is made independently of fulfillment decision of other items in the same order, this heuristic does not have a satisfactory performance. The second heuristic improves the first heuristic by allowing fulfillment consolidation across different items in the same order. We do this by modifying the DLP solution through a carefully constructed correlated rounding (or coupling) among the decision variables.

Statistical discrimination theory suggests that profit-maximizing employers should use all the information about job candidates, including information about group membership (e.g., race or gender), to make accurate predictions. In contrast, research on heuristics in psychology suggests that using less information can be better. Drawing on research on heuristics, we show that even small amounts of inconsistency can make predictions using group membership less accurate than predictions that do not use this information. That is, whereas statistical discrimination theory implies that better predictions can be achieved by using all available information about an individual (including group characteristics that may be correlated with but do not cause performance), our model shows that using all available information only improves predictive accuracy under a very specific set of conditions, thus suggesting that statistical discrimination often results in worse predictions. By understanding when statistical discrimination improves or worsens predictions, our work cautions decision makers and uncovers paths toward reducing the occurrence of situations in which statistical discrimination benefits predictive accuracy, thus reducing its pervasiveness in society.

However, the career consequences of bystander reporters (e.g., their hireability prospects inside and outside the organization)—those who report sexual harassment on behalf of coworkers—are not well understood. Based on the social identity and person perception literatures, which suggest that recruiters are motivated to hire candidates with attributes helpful to the organization (perceived moral character and agreeableness), we proposed that candidates' history of reporting sexual harassment on behalf of a victim leads to perceived high moral character but low agreeableness, which subsequently have countervailing effects on hireability of these known reporters. We found support across three experimental studies using realistic hiring decision‐making tasks and various employee samples. Based on the social identity literature, we further argued that perceptions and hireability of the known reporters depend on recruiter and candidate genders. In Study 2 and Study 3, we consistently found that the positive effect of reporting on perceptions of candidate moral character was weaker when the recruiter was male (vs. female) but we found mixed results for candidate gender effects.

This article develops and tests theory to understand this phenomenon of organization-as-platform activism, using the National Football League “Take a Knee” employee athlete protests as an empirical context. Drawing on past research on social movements and employee activism, we offer a theoretical comparison of these three forms of activism—citizen, organizational-change, and organization-as-platform—to conceptually distinguish them and to theorize factors that uniquely predict the occurrence of platform activism. We find evidence of predictors associated with the attributes of the organizational platform and those of the intended stakeholder audience. Organization-as-platform activism is associated with the accessibility and openness of the organizational platform for messaging use, the visibility of the organizational platform for message transmission, and the receptivity of the targeted stakeholder audience.

In this study, we examine the effects that a widely used organizational practice-leadership endorsements in the CEO succession announcement-has on female CEOs' longevity in the CEO role. In particular, we theorize that the leadership endorsements of incoming female CEOs that highlight their past achievements and competence violate stakeholders' prescriptive stereotypes, thereby increasing the likelihood of stakeholders viewing the female leaders through a stereotypical lens. Therefore, though well intentioned, leadership endorsements in female CEOs' succession announcements foment a stereotype threat situation that is likely to have long-term negative consequences for female leaders. We investigate and find support for this relationship using archival data for a sample of 91 female CEO successions among S&P 1500 and Fortune 500 firms between 1995 and 2012. Several post hoc analyses, including in-depth interviews with 31 female executives, further strengthen our findings and show that this effect does not occur among male CEO succession events. We also find that two key facets of the succession context work to ameliorate this negative relationship: the insider status of the female CEO and the number of female executives at the focal firm.

Our study contributes to this literature by conducting a comprehensive multivariate analysis of the inherent tension between the effects of price and demand uncertainty on cost elasticity and cost asymmetry. Using the occurrence of words implying uncertainty in forward-looking statements in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of 10-K reports to measure the managerial perception of the overall, price, and demand uncertainty, we provide evidence of a positive and significant association between price uncertainty and cost elasticity and a negative and significant association between demand uncertainty and cost elasticity. The former finding is consistent with managers’ desire to shift to a more elastic cost function in the face of high price uncertainty; the latter supports the hypothesis that firms facing demand uncertainty will increase their capacity of fixed resources to avoid disproportionately large production congestion costs associated with high demand realizations. We reconcile findings in prior studies by demonstrating that the association between demand uncertainty and cost elasticity is negative for manufacturing firms but is positive for firms in the healthcare sector. We also document that managerial perception of the overall uncertainty exacerbates the degree of cost asymmetry.

When the conditional persistence of revenue surprises is high (low) relative to its unconditional persistence, both the post‐earnings‐announcement drift and the post‐revenue‐announcement drift are high (low), because investors’ under‐reaction to revenues and earnings is stronger when the persistence of revenue surprises is more strongly associated with the persistence of earnings surprises. Also, the mispricing of accruals decreases substantially when the conditional persistence of accruals is high relative to its unconditional persistence, because investors’ over‐reaction to accruals is mitigated when the persistence of accruals is indeed more strongly associated with the persistence of earnings.

Opens a new window","Problem definition: Energy storage has become an indispensable part of power distribution systems, necessitating prudent investment decisions. We analyze an energy storage facility location problem and compare the benefits of centralized storage (adjacent to a central energy generation site) versus distributed storage (localized at demand sites). This problem encompasses optimizing storage capacities across all locations, with the objective of minimizing the total storage investment and energy generation costs. Methodology/results: We employ a stylized model that captures essential features of an energy distribution system, including convex costs, stochastic demand, storage efficiency, and line losses. Using dynamic programming, we optimize storage operations and derive value function properties that are key to analyzing the storage investment decisions. We discern fundamental differences between centralization/localization decisions at the capacity investment stage and the centralization/localization decisions at the storage operations level. Operationally, centrally stored energy offers more flexibility, which is consistent with the conventional understanding of inventory pooling. However, we find that localized storage often emerges as the preferred option at the investment stage under various circumstances. Managerial implications: Storage investment should first be made at the demand locations with positive minimum demand regardless of the level of demand variability. Subsequent storage investment should consider the tradeoffs between centralized versus localized investment. Operationally, the relative magnitudes of storage and line losses drive different optimal storage policies. Despite the differences, these policies are guided by common principles such as pooling inventory and balancing local storage levels.

In “Conveying Demand Information in Serial Supply Chains with Capacity Limits,” Kapuscinski and Parker show that local information alone is sufficient to effectively manage inventory in capacity-limited supply chains. In supply chains with capacity limits, the retailer does not faithfully pass the demand information to her supplier but sends censored information in her order. Despite censoring, these orders contain sufficient information for the modified echelon base-stock policy, a full-information policy, to be mimicked. They provide evidence using numerical experiments and analytical bounds that the modified echelon base-stock policy performs superbly.

Opens a new window","To mitigate supply disruption risks, some manufacturers consider a flexible sourcing strategy, where they have an option of sourcing from multiple suppliers, including regular unreliable suppliers and backup reliable ones. Our objective is to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with flexible sourcing when suppliers are strategic price setters. We show that when each supplier announces a single (wholesale) price, such a game leads to a conflict of incentives and is not realistic in most practical settings. Therefore, we focus on a contingent-pricing game, with wholesale prices contingent on the manufacturer’s sourcing strategy. We describe the resulting equilibrium outcomes corresponding to the manufacturer’s different sourcing and inventory strategies. We show that in equilibrium, inventories are carried either by the manufacturer or by the unreliable supplier, but not both. The manufacturer does not necessarily benefit from the existence of a backup supplier and, in fact, is typically worse off. Similarly, supply chain performance may degrade. Thus, an up-front commitment to sole sourcing may be beneficial. Interestingly, suppliers may benefit from flexible sourcing even though the manufacturer does not. The main results extend to cases when partial backup sourcing is allowed, both suppliers are unreliable, recovery times are non-memoryless, an unreliable supplier may provide a richer set of contingent prices, or the supplier may be risk averse.

Opens a new window","We examine the impact of consumer valuation interdependence and capacity on a firm’s optimal selling strategies. We consider a seller who can offer a single product to consumers twice, in advance and in spot. Consumers choose whether and when to buy, but if they buy in advance, they are uncertain about their own valuations. Whether they buy in advance or in spot, consumers’ valuations are realized in the spot period and they may range from fully independent to perfectly correlated, creating markets with different characteristics of aggregate demand for the seller. Facing these consumers, the seller chooses a portion of the total capacity to offer in advance and prices in both periods. We describe how the optimal strategy and benefits of advance selling depend on the interdependence of consumer valuation, as well as capacity level and other market parameters. We find that a change in valuation interdependence can lead to dramatically different policies for the seller. For example, when individual valuations are highly diverse and the consumer population is large, the seller must offer a discount during advance selling but may limit the advance sales. On the other hand, when valuations are highly correlated, the seller can charge a premium price during advance selling. For the same valuation interdependence, the qualitative nature of the optimal strategy changes with available capacity.

We analyze a multiperiod inventory model for two products and derive the optimal production policy at stage 1 as well as the optimal allocation of the shared resource to demands at stage 2. For the shared resource, because of its capacity uncertainty, not only the total planned production quantities matter, but also the sequence in which the products are processed. We characterize the optimal allocation of the shared resource and show that the optimal policy keeps the ending inventories of products as close to a so-called “target path” as possible. For the dedicated production lines, because of their capacity uncertainty, the optimal production policy depends on the initial inventories. We identify and characterize the structural properties of the optimal production policy. Through a numerical study, we explore how the presence of finite shared capacity influences the inventory targets.

f01abbedfee6730d904bc7e38ea68f4d406d075a,Samantha Keppler,Time is Not Money: Time Logics and Workforce Operations Within School-Nonprofit Relationships,"Nonprofit organizations amplify impact through relationships with K-12 schools, and these schools benefit from provided resources and services. Nonprofit provision of resources and services via schools is theoretically mutually beneficial, efficient, and effective. In practice, however, schools struggle to make the necessary investments to maintain relationships. Why? Through an inductive multimethods study of 81 nonprofit organizations and nine schools that partner with them, we find that schools struggle because it is difficult to effectively manage the temporal costs of the relationships. Principals, teachers, and staff have many demands on their time, and spending additional time coordinating and administrating nonprofit relationships is a challenge. Intersecting survey, interview, and archival data from schools and nonprofit organizations, we find the nine schools take on this operational challenge of managing temporal costs with one of two time logics, defined as a sociocultural belief about time resources at the school. The three charter schools in our study have a fixed logic that views time as a static resource, while the public and Catholic schools have an adaptable logic that views time as a flexible resource. We observe that these logics correspond to the school’s workforce operations, specifically whether or not they rely on external affiliates, such as district/community leaders or parents, to dedicate time to help manage school–nonprofit relationships. Schools with an adaptable-time logic have more time flexibility for managing nonprofit relationships when they rely on this external “workforce” compared to schools with a fixed-time logic that do not. The evidence suggests more generally how organizational culture and time logics relate to workforce operations. We conclude with preliminary evidence of long-term relationship outcomes from a follow-up survey of the same schools in our original study and discuss the implications for improving nonprofit provision of resources and services via schools.",Crossref,98.86363636363636,10.1177/10591478241270129,https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241270129,2024.0,Production and Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Time is Not Money: Time Logics and Workforce Operations Within School-Nonprofit ,Time is Not Money: Time Logics and Workforce Operations Within School–Nonprofit Relationships,10.1177/10591478241270129,,Goal 4,0.0171066444618947,False,school infrastructure

These experiments inform behavioral theories of operations management, impacting domains including inventory, supply chain management, queuing, forecasting, and sourcing. Yet, until now, the replicability of most behavioral insights from these laboratory experiments has been untested. We remedy this with the first large-scale replication study in operations management. With the input of the wider operations management community, we identify 10 prominent experimental operations management papers published in Management Science, which span a variety of domains, to be the focus of our replication effort. For each paper, we conduct a high-powered replication study of the main results across multiple locations using original materials (when available and suitable). In addition, our study tests replicability in multiple modalities (in-person and online) due to laboratory closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our replication study contributes new knowledge about the robustness of several key behavioral theories in operations management and contributes more broadly to efforts in the operations management field to improve research transparency and reliability.

If strong relationships support knowledge sharing, workers will have a harder time getting knowledge they need. Prior research shows that digital communication technologies increase workers’ network-level knowledge of “who knows what” and “who knows who.” Yet, knowledge seekers may be hesitant to ask for knowledge, particularly when they have concerns that their relationship with a knowledge source is too distant. We conduct a dyad-level study of 141 instances of knowledge seeking among employees of a South American telecommunications company employing a hybrid work arrangement and using an enterprise social media called Chatter. We find that specific uses of the technology help develop what we call “relational confidence,” or the confidence that one has a close enough relationship to a colleague to ask and get needed knowledge. With greater relational confidence, knowledge sharing is more successful.",Crossref,89.55223880597015,10.1093/jcmc/zmad020,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcmc/zmad020,2023.0,Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,ok,CR-title:Building Relational Confidence in Remote and Hybrid Work Arrangements: Novel Way,Building relational confidence in remote and hybrid work arrangements: novel ways to use digital technologies to foster knowledge sharing,10.1093/jcmc/zmad020,,Goal 17,0.02328092426088679,False,

We take an equity perspective and ask the following questions. (i) How do partnering workarounds differ across schools with different levels of socioeconomic advantage? (ii) What can education and NPO leaders do to ensure these workarounds do not exacerbate educational inequities? To answer these questions, we use Little’s Law: a school’s long-run average number of resource-supplementing partnerships (L) is a function of its average annual partnership formation rate (λ) and partnership cycle time (W). We collect and analyze interview (n = 62) and survey (n = 140) data from six strategically sampled schools with different levels of socioeconomic advantage to compare differences in λ and W and understand the implications for educational equity. We find wealthier schools have higher λ, making them more productive. We also find schools have equal W independent of wealth, but this problematically amplifies differences in λ. The difference in partnering productivity translates to educational inequities. We find that poorer schools report about 35% greater utility per partnership, but that is not enough to offset the disadvantage of fewer partnerships. Moreover, we find that differences in partnering productivity are particularly large for curricular partnerships, which are harder for poorer schools to form because of the high demand for wrap-around partnerships. Our findings contribute new knowledge on workarounds which supplement organizational resources and on the relationship between workarounds and equity.

Opens a new window","The U.S. K–12 public education system has been notoriously hard to improve. Some argue new education technologies (EdTech) can help transform schools for the better. Yet, as large-scale policy reforms have had only limited success, it seems unlikely that small changes from EdTech could have any measurable impact. In this paper, we study DonorsChoose, a nonprofit that operates a teacher crowdfunding platform. We ask whether DonorsChoose improves educational outcomes, specifically at low-income schools. Combining DonorsChoose data with data on student test scores in Pennsylvania from 2012–2013 to 2017–2018, we find that an increase in the number of DonorsChoose projects funded at a school leads to higher student performance, after controlling for selection biases. For a school with zero funded projects, one funded project—of about $400 in value—translates to between two to nine more students scoring basic and above in all subjects in high school and science and language arts in primary and middle school. We find this effect is driven mostly by low-income schools, indicating funded projects help close the gap in educational outcomes between students at low- versus high-income schools. Based on a textual analysis of 20,000 statements from all funded teachers describing how project resources are used, we find two channels of improvement most effective in the lowest income schools. We demonstrate that, although DonorsChoose projects are small, they improve outcomes and reduce inequality because they come directly from frontline workers—teachers—who know most intimately the obstacles their students face and how to help.

Opens a new window","Problem definition: Trustworthy partners in procurement and service relationships are an asset. How can organizations discern trustworthy from untrustworthy partners, especially early on, so as to not waste time or resources on bad relationships? Academic/practical relevance: Like prior studies, we take the perspective that organizations rarely know whether a partner is trustworthy, but also that organizations often have some evidence of a partner’s trustworthiness, even before interacting. We argue a qualitative study is needed to understand how people discern a partner’s trustworthiness and the consequences of initial perceptions on the relationship trajectory. Methodology: We conduct an interview-based study of how people discern trustworthy partners in a setting where doing so is challenging: the education sector. Kindergarten-through-12th-grade schools must choose outside partners to rely on for resources or services the school cannot afford. Potential partners are numerous and of variable trustworthiness. Results: We find people use contextual factors as evidence of a potential partner’s trustworthiness, such as the partner’s institutional affiliations, physical proximity, and relationships with other schools. Sometimes the evidence indicates that a partner acts intrinsically trustworthily, regardless of these contextual factors. In other cases, the evidence indicates a partner acts contextually trustworthily, meaning partners follow through in some conditions but not others. Intrinsically trustworthy partners provide valuable but standardized resources or services. Contextually trustworthy partners provide the competitive advantage: customized resources that are not easily accessible by other schools. Managerial implications: People in organizations identify trustworthy partners via contextual factors, which helps them determine whether a partner acts trustworthily independent of context or conditional on context. The value of intrinsically trustworthy partners derives from their low risk and high quality, whereas the value of contextually trustworthy partners derives from their willingness to customize resources or services to some—but not all—organizations.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2020.0892,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2020.0892,2021.0,Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Contextual Trustworthiness of Organizational Partners: Evidence from Nine School,Contextual Trustworthiness of Organizational Partners: Evidence from Nine School Networks,10.1287/msom.2020.0892,,Goal 4,0.02458080849336558,False,school infrastructure

Opens a new window","Background
Expansion of telehealth is a high-priority strategic initiative for many health systems. Surgical clinics' implementation of video visits has been identified as a way to improve patient and provider experience. However, whether using video visits can reduce the cost of an outpatient visit is unknown.


Methods
Prospective case study using time-driven activity-based costing at two outpatient surgical clinics at an academic institution. We conducted stakeholder interviews and in-person observations to map outpatient clinic flow and measure resource utilization of four key steps: check-in, vitals collection and rooming, clinician encounter, and check-out. Finally, we calculated the resource cost for each step using representative salary information to calculate total visit cost.


Results
Video visits did not systematically reduce the amount of time clinicians spent with patients. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] visit costs were as follows: traditional clinic visits, $26.84 ($10.13); physician-led video visits, $27.26 ($9.69); and physician assistant-led video visits, $9.86 ($2.76). There was no significant difference in the total cost associated with physician-led traditional clinic visits and video visits (P=0.89). However, physician assistant-led video visits were significantly lower cost than physician-led video visits (P<0.001).


Conclusions
Using physician-led video visits does not reduce the cost of outpatient surgical visits when compared to traditional clinic visits. However, the use of less expensive clinician resources for video visits (e.g., physician-assistants) may yield cost savings for clinics.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.21037/mhealth-20-33,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ce3430b12c9ad8f67b8c76f8851755f5216a17e3,2020.0,mHealth,ok,CR-title:Understanding the cost savings of video visits in outpatient surgical clinics Op,Understanding the cost savings of video visits in outpatient surgical clinics,10.21037/mhealth-20-33,,Goal 3,0.01302962278069203,False,health care costs

Opens a new window","We consider a class of three-objective mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) where at least one of the objective functions takes only discrete values. These problems commonly occur in MILPs where one or more of the three objective functions contain only integer decision variables. In such problems, the nondominated set consists of the union of nondominated edges and individual nondominated points. The nondominated edges can provide valuable insights on the trade-offs between the two continuous objectives at different levels of the discrete-valued objective. We develop an objective-space search algorithm that keeps partitioning the search space by progressively creating cones in the two-dimensional feasible space of the two continuous objectives for relevant values of the discrete-valued objective. The algorithm generates the nondominated points or edges in the nonincreasing order of the feasible values of the selected discrete-valued objective. Additionally, the algorithm uncovers all efficient integer variable vectors, including different vectors that lead to the same nondominated points or edges. We apply the algorithm to the day-ahead electricity market clearing problem. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

By interaction patterns we refer to whether preference questioning is more front‐, center‐, rear‐, or edge‐loaded. As test problems we use two‐ to four‐objective knapsack problems, multicriteria scheduling problems, and multiobjective facility location problems. In the tests, two different preference functions are used to represent actual decision maker preferences, linear and Chebyshev. The results indicate that it is possible to obtain solutions that are very good or even nearly optimal with a reasonable number of interactions.

Opens a new window","When customers express anger, do they gain greater returns, as suggested by the proverb “the squeaky wheel gets the grease”? If so, does the intensity of the squeak matter? In four studies, we explore employee compensation responses to customers who express relatively high- versus low-intensity anger in service-failure settings. The studies demonstrate that the cultural value of power distance (PD) moderates the relationship between emotional intensity and customer compensation: High-PD service employees offer less compensation to customers expressing higher intensity anger, and low-PD service employees offer more to customers expressing higher intensity anger. For high-PD service employees, this relationship between emotional intensity and compensation is mediated by the perceived appropriateness of the anger expression; for low-PD employees, it is mediated by perceived threat.

Opens a new window","In 2023, US regulators proposed the “Basel Endgame,” a long-awaited overhaul of bank capital requirements. The proposal aimed to bring the United States into compliance with international standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, fierce industry opposition to what banks viewed as a costly increase in capital requirements effectively killed the proposal. In this essay, we describe the purpose of bank capital and the history of international standardsetting in bank regulation. We then highlight the most important aspects of the Basel Endgame, as well as the arguments for and against adopting the rule. We show that the debate unnecessarily conflated two distinct questions: (1) whether the United States should comply with international regulatory standards, and (2) whether the United States should raise large banks' capital requirements. While there are strong grounds to answer both questions in the affirmative, they need not be addressed together. That is, the United States can implement international standards in a capital-neutral manner to preserve global cooperation in bank regulation, leaving the separate question of raising capital requirements for another day.",Crossref,100.0,10.1257/jep.20241434,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.20241434,2025.0,Journal of Economic Perspectives,ok,CR-title:Basel Endgame: Bank Capital Requirements and the Future of International Standar,Basel Endgame: Bank Capital Requirements and the Future of International Standard Setting,10.1257/jep.20241434,,Goal 17,0.05073823402338158,True,global financial system
ffa44ab3769675ecb0ecc6f901ed651ce4098ca4,Jeremy Kress,"Rethinking Countercyclical Financial Regulation 
Opens a new window","The 2008 financial crisis exposed a longstanding problem in financial regulation: traditional regulatory strategies tend to be procyclical. That is, regulatory tools—most notably, bank capital requirements—incentivize excessive credit growth during economic expansions and insufficient lending during contractions. The procyclicality of U.S. financial regulation was a key driver of the housing bubble in the mid-2000s and the massive credit crunch that followed. To combat this phenomenon, Congress and the federal banking agencies attempted to mitigate procyclical boom-and-bust cycles by implementing regulatory approaches that were explicitly countercyclical. The Dodd-Frank Act and related post-crisis reforms included several countercyclical features that were designed to become stricter during periods of economic growth and more lenient during contractions, with the goal of smoothing economic cycles. Less than a decade later, however, these countercyclical tools failed to prevent unprecedented financial stress during the COVID-19 recession. This Article is the first legal scholarship to revisit the design of countercyclical rules in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. It reveals weaknesses in Dodd-Frank’s countercyclical approach and the significant costs of failing to implement an effective countercyclical strategy. The Article also establishes a blueprint for strengthening the United States’ countercyclical framework going forward. The Article identifies three principles—automaticity, portfolio strategy, and market-wide coverage—that should guide countercyclical policymaking. It then applies these principles to five specific areas in which financial regulators should bolster countercyclical oversight: bank capital requirements, accounting standards, securitization rules, early remediation guidelines, and margin requirements. Taken together, these reforms are critical to making countercyclical financial regulation work and creating a more stable and prosperous financial system.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.3848990,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de6ac6eaff065dd5df32bb073da851c665a110b8,2021.0,Social Science Research Network,ok,CR-title:Rethinking Countercyclical Financial Regulation Opens a new window,Rethinking Countercyclical Financial Regulation,10.2139/ssrn.3848990,,Goal 8,0.05033451761692354,True,financial institutions

Opens a new window","More than a decade after the 2008 financial crisis, U.S. policymakers still have not adequately addressed one of the primary causes of the crash: foreign banks. When foreign banks first entered the United States fifty years ago, they specialized in traditional banking products like loans and deposit accounts. Over time, however, foreign banks shifted to a riskier strategy focused on speculative capital markets investments and fueled by volatile short-term debt. This novel business model created vulnerabilities for the U.S. financial system, as became clear when Deutsche Bank, Barclays, UBS, and other foreign banks accelerated the 2008 crisis. 
 
This Article contends that while foreign banks’ role in the U.S. financial system has changed dramatically over time, the U.S. regulatory framework has not kept pace. After the financial crisis, policymakers tried to rein in foreign banks by regulating some of their U.S. offices directly, rather than deferring to home country authorities. Foreign banks, however, have largely evaded these reforms by shifting billions of dollars in assets to lightly-regulated U.S. branches — a classic case of regulatory arbitrage. This Article asserts that foreign banks continue to pose risks to the U.S. financial system, threatening a recurrence of the Great Recession. Accordingly, this Article recommends an alternative regulatory approach — namely, mandatory subsidiarization of foreign bank branches — that would better safeguard foreign banks’ U.S. operations, consistent with longstanding international regulatory norms.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.3705314,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93de8e87fb8bcedf15b1fbb7a8f26ae31ecc60d7,2020.0,Social Science Research Network,ok,CR-title:Domesticating Foreign Finance Opens a new window,Domesticating Foreign Finance,10.2139/ssrn.3705314,,Goal 17,0.04007294649493698,False,global financial system
ae1beda9566a8aa6edee955cc3299be026027d97,Jeremy Kress,"Too Many to Fail: Against Community Bank Deregulation 
Opens a new window","Since the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers and scholars have fixated on the problem of “too-big-to-fail” banks. This fixation, however, overlooks the historically dominant pattern in banking crises: the contemporaneous failure of many small institutions. We call this blind spot the “too-many-to-fail” problem and document how its neglect has skewed the past decade of financial regulation. In particular, we argue that, for so-called community banks, there has been a pronounced and unjustifiable shift toward deregulation, culminating in sweeping regulatory rollbacks in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. 
 
As this Article demonstrates, this deregulatory trend rests on three myths. First, that community banks do not contribute to systemic risk and were not central to the 2008 crisis. Second, that the Dodd-Frank Act imposed regulatory burdens that threaten the survival of the community bank sector. And third, that community banks cannot remain viable without special subsidies or regulatory advantages. While these claims have gained near-universal acceptance among legal scholars and policymakers, none of them withstands scrutiny. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, community banks were key participants in the 2008 crisis, were not uniquely burdened by post-crisis reforms, and continue to thrive economically. 
 
Dispelling these myths about the community bank sector leads to the conclusion that diligent oversight of community banks is necessary to preserve financial stability. Accordingly, this Article recommends a reversal of the community bank deregulatory trend and proposes affirmative reforms, including enhanced supervision and macro-prudential stress tests, that would help mitigate systemic risks in the community bank sector.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.3503692,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d245ba97889c884391a26be437ff8cf02f09bdb,2019.0,Social Science Research Network,ok,CR-title:Too Many to Fail: Against Community Bank Deregulation Opens a new window,Too Many to Fail: Against Community Bank Deregulation,10.2139/ssrn.3503692,,Goal 8,0.02407177094728465,False,

While consumers often want to make environmentally friendly product choices, we find that their perceptions of the environmental friendliness of product packaging may systematically deviate from its objective environmental friendliness. Eight studies (N = 4,103) document the perceived environmental friendliness (PEF) bias whereby consumers judge plastic packaging with additional paper to be more environmentally friendly than identical plastic packaging without the paper. The PEF bias is driven by consumers’ “paper = good, plastic = bad” beliefs and by proportional reasoning, wherein packaging with a greater paper-to-plastic proportion is judged as more environmentally friendly. We further show that the PEF bias impacts consumers’ willingness to pay and product choice. Importantly, this bias can be mitigated by a “minimal packaging sticker” intervention, which increases the environmental friendliness perceptions of plastic-only packaging, rendering plastic-packaged products to be preferable to their plastic-plus-paper-packaged counterparts.

These ads typically include visuals of the starting and ending point of the promised change (“before/after” ads). “Progression” ads, which include intermediate steps in addition to starting and ending points, are much rarer in the marketplace. Across several consumer domains, the authors show an ad-type effect: progression ads foster spontaneous simulation of the process through which the change will happen, which makes these ads more credible and, in turn, more persuasive than before/after ads (Studies 1–3). The authors also show that impairing process simulation and high skepticism moderate the ad-type effect (Studies 4–5). Finally, they show effect reversals: if consumers focus on achieving the desired results quickly, and it is possible to do so, progression ads and the associated process simulation backfire in terms of credibility and persuasion (Studies 6–7).

This contraction effect of unpacking a judgment is driven by motivated reasoning. Consumers are motivated to reduce calorie consumption, and this motive directs their cognitive elaboration for the budget decision to be on what to cut and how much to cut. Furthermore, the categorical (vs. overall) approach brings to mind more thoughts that are consistent with the motive to reduce consumption, which then leads to a lower calorie budget. Consistent with this explanation, the level of elaboration on reducing calorie intake—especially on occasions where overconsumption is less salient—mediates the contraction effect. In addition, the contraction effect is attenuated when the motive to reduce consumption is deactivated. Finally, while the contraction effect occurs when consumers have a motive to reduce consumption, the classic expansion effect of unpacking occurs when consumers are prompted to think about what to consume or are motivated to increase consumption. The results for calorie budgeting are shown to have downstream consequences on actual food consumption.",Crossref,100.0,10.1093/jcr/ucz036,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucz036,2019.0,Journal of Consumer Research,ok,CR-title:Contraction with Unpacking: When Unpacking Leads to Lower Calorie Budgets,Contraction with Unpacking: When Unpacking Leads to Lower Calorie Budgets,10.1093/jcr/ucz036,,Goal 12,0.02899166030845379,False,

Nonetheless, consumers do not want to give up indulgences altogether and find ways to allow themselves guilt-free gratification. We propose a novel, calculated tactic that consumers use to avoid unpleasant feelings often associated with unhealthy eating. Four studies demonstrate that consumers proactively and strategically confer responsibility for indulgences to other people to prevent looming negative feelings about consuming the same item. In laboratory and field experiments, for unhealthy (compared to healthy) foods consumers exhibit a preference for being served a chosen food instead of serving themselves. Moderation and mediation show that this preference is driven by anticipated negative self-conscious affect, which gives rise to a motivation to avoid responsibility. Across our studies, people seek to alter the social context surrounding indulgent food consumption in this way, despite making their own food choices.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1086/701821,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf5ce584a12a7d155303fb8f59129051397d612a,2019.0,Journal of the Association for Consumer Research,ok,CR-title:Outsourcing Responsibility for Indulgent Food Consumption to Prevent Negative Af,Outsourcing Responsibility for Indulgent Food Consumption to Prevent Negative Affect,10.1086/701821,,Goal 2,0.1145172052658302,True,food insecurity; moderate food insecurity

Jost's arguments and data are very compelling and will inspire consumer psychologists to do more research in the political domain. To enable this goal further, we complement the target article by focusing on partisanship, another major determinant of political judgments and decisions. Whereas political ideology refers to people being more liberal or conservative, partisanship refers to how strongly people identify with a specific political party (e.g., Republicans or Democrats). In reviewing the literature on partisanship, we concentrate on voting behaviors and attitudes, an area not addressed by Jost, but of great importance for consumer psychologists given the large expenditures on political advertising. Adding to Jost's discussion of the link between political ideology and systematic processing, we examine the interplay between these two constructs and partisanship.",Crossref,91.25,10.1016/j.jcps.2017.07.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2017.07.005,2017.0,Journal of Consumer Psychology,ok,CR-title:A Focus on Partisanship: How It Impacts Voting behaviors and Political Attitudes,A focus on partisanship: How it impacts voting behaviors and political attitudes,10.1016/j.jcps.2017.07.005,,Goal 10,0.01872434606994824,False,

Placebo effects of marketing labels on perceived intoxication and risky attitudes and behaviors,"Abstract Why sexual assaults and car accidents are associated with the consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AMED) is still unclear. In a single study, we show that the label used to describe AMED cocktails can have causal non‐pharmacological effects on consumers' perceived intoxication, attitudes, and behaviors. Young men who consumed a cocktail of fruit juice, vodka, and Red Bull felt more intoxicated, took more risks, were more sexually self‐confident, but intended to wait longer before driving when the cocktail's label emphasized the presence of the energy drink (a “Vodka‐Red Bull cocktail”) compared to when it did not (a “Vodka” or “Exotic fruits” cocktail). Speaking to the process underlying these placebo effects, we found no moderation of experience but a strong interaction with expectations: These effects were stronger for people who believe that energy drinks boost alcohol intoxication and who believe that intoxication increases impulsiveness, reduces sexual inhibition, and weakens reflexes. These findings have implications for understanding marketing placebo effects and for the pressing debate on the regulation of the marketing of energy drinks.",Crossref,100.0,10.1016/j.jcps.2017.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2017.03.003,2017.0,Journal of Consumer Psychology,ok,CR-title:Does Red Bull give wings to vodka?

Furthermore, consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts.

It is argued that evidence-based modelling provides additional sources to truly arrive at a theory through the inductive process of a Grounded Theory approach. This is shown by two examples. One example concerns the development of software ontologies of criminal organisations. The other example is a simulation model of escalation of ethno-nationalist conflicts. The first example concerns early to middle stages of the research process. The development of an ontology provides a tool for the process of theoretical coding in a GT approach. The second example shows stylised facts resulting from a simulation model of the escalation of ethno-nationalist conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. These reveal mechanisms of nationalist radicalisation.

We propose that embarrassment can also be felt when one violates a social norm in private, or when one appraises oneself and violates one's self‐concept (“private embarrassment”). We develop a typology of embarrassment with two underlying dimensions – social context (transgression in‐public or in‐private) and mechanism (appraisal by others or by the self). Of the four resulting categories, one fits with the dominant “social” view of embarrassment, whereas the other three have aspects of privacy. We generate triggers for public and private embarrassment and demonstrate their similarities in study 1. Study 2 (buying an incontinence drug) and study 3 (buying Viagra for impotence versus pleasure) replicate these similarities, and also exhibit differences in the experience of public and private embarrassment through accompanying physiological reactions, action tendencies, and behavioral consequences. Our aim is to expand the scope of embarrassment research to include private contexts and self‐appraisal.",Crossref,86.15384615384616,10.1016/j.jcps.2015.02.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2015.02.005,2015.0,Journal of Consumer Psychology,ok,CR-title:Wetting the Bed at Twenty One: Embarrassment as a Private Emotion,Wetting the bed at twenty‐one: Embarrassment as a private emotion,10.1016/j.jcps.2015.02.005,,Goal 17,0.03604437517452833,False,
c1a25ae712228ed93e1a689677bc04dbe58e5403,M.S. Krishnan,How the Locus of Uncertainty Shapes the Influence of CEO Long-term Compensation on IT Capital Investments,"Firms must allocate resources effectively to cope with uncertainty, which can manifest as a disruption and an opportunity. Although information technology (IT) is a means to cope with uncertainty, chief executive officers (CEOs) may not always support IT investments due to the risky nature of IT, especially when facing uncertain conditions. While prior research suggests that CEO long-term compensation positively incentivizes IT investments, little is known about how different loci of uncertainty impact this relationship. To address this research gap, we study how firm-specific uncertainty and competitive uncertainty shape the influence of CEO long-term compensation on a firm’s IT capital investment. Drawing on agency theory and prospect theory, we develop two hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that firm-specific uncertainty and competitive uncertainty positively moderate the influence of CEO long-term compensation on firm IT capital investment. Second, we hypothesize that competitive uncertainty has a stronger positive moderating effect than firm-specific uncertainty on the influence of CEO long-term compensation on firm IT capital investment. Our analysis of secondary longitudinal data from 2000 to 2007 of 357 public firms in the United States supports our hypotheses. In exploratory analyses, we found that CEO long-term compensation results in a higher risk-oriented dominant logic in the firm, particularly in conditions of firm-specific uncertainty and competitive uncertainty, with competitive uncertainty having a stronger positive moderating effect. These findings uncover risk-oriented dominant logic as a theoretical mechanism that explains how CEO long-term compensation positively influences firm IT capital investment in uncertain conditions. We also conducted exploratory analyses using a different secondary dataset of 286 U.S. public firms from 2004 to 2019 to consider firm investments in transformative IT applications and found support for our theory. This finding triangulates our results across different time periods and different types of IT investments. This study contributes to theory and practice by providing a nuanced understanding of boundary conditions surrounding CEO long-term compensation, and decisions CEOs make vis-à-vis IT capital investments.",Crossref,92.89617486338798,10.25300/misq/2023/17433,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2023/17433,2024.0,MIS Quarterly,ok,CR-title:How the Locus of Uncertainty Shapes the Influence of CEO Long-term Compensation ,How the Locus of Uncertainty Shapes the Influence of CEO Long-Term Compensation on Information Technology Capital Investments,10.25300/misq/2023/17433,,Goal 17,0.02475038728621711,False,

Krishnan,"Leveraging Customer Involvement for Fueling Innovation: The Role of Relational and Analytical Information Processing Capabilities,","How do IT-enabled capabilities influence firms’ ability to leverage customer involvement and shape the amount of firm innovation? This study theorizes that effective processing and management of customer information flows requires organizations to possess “relational information processing capability” (RIPC) and “analytical information processing capability” (AIPC). Drawing on and extending the theories of absorptive capacity and complementarities in the context of innovation, we posit that RIPC and AIPC complement product-focused customer involvement (PCI) and information-intensive customer involvement (ICI) practices, respectively, to enhance the amount of firm innovation. To test our hypotheses, we collected archival data from more than 300 large U.S. manufacturing firms and mapped their RIPC and AIPC to specific IT applications. Consistent with our theorizing, we find that RIPC positively moderates the relationship between PCI and amount of firm innovation and that AIPC positively moderates the relationship between ICI and amount of firm innovation. In further exploratory analysis, we find a positive three-way interaction between AIPC, RIPC, and PCI. Taken together, the results suggest that configurations of IT-enabled capabilities alone are not enough for innovation; instead, firms benefit more when specific configurations of IT-enabled capabilities are leveraged in unison with specific types of customer involvement. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on important complementarities between specific types of customer involvement (PCI and ICI) and specific IT-enabled capabilities (RIPC and AIPC).",Crossref,99.23076923076923,10.25300/misq/2017/41.1.14,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2017/41.1.14,2017.0,MIS Quarterly,ok,CR-title:Leveraging Customer Involvement for Fueling Innovation: The Role of Relational a,Leveraging Customer Involvement for Fueling Innovation: The Role of Relational and Analytical Information Processing Capabilities1,10.25300/misq/2017/41.1.14,,Goal 9,0.03556444052121237,False,

Using data on 109 U.S. firms for the 1994–1996 and 1999–2006 periods, we find that aggregate IT investments have a positive association with customer satisfaction. However, the strength of the relationship varied across the 1994–1996 and 1999–2006 periods. Specifically, IT investments had a more positive influence on customer satisfaction for the 1994–1996 period than for the 1999–2006 period. Conversely, IT investments had a positive effect on profits in the 1999–2006 period, but a negative effect in the 1994–1996 period. These findings extend prior discourse in the information systems literature on the role of customer satisfaction as a mechanism that explains how IT-enabled benefits are “passed on to consumers” [Rai A, Patnayakuni R, Patnayakuni N (1997) Technology investment and business performance.

We propose that these efforts, though well-intentioned, may exacerbate this problem by negatively influencing a potential driver of loneliness: people’s beliefs about being alone. Supporting this thesis, we show that contemporary U.S. news articles are 10 times more likely to describe being alone as harmful than beneficial (Study 1, N = 144 articles) and that exposure to such articles causally impacts people’s beliefs about being alone (Study 2, N = 456). Further, a 2-week experience-sampling study (Study 3, N = 161) demonstrates that people with negative beliefs about being alone experience a steep increase in loneliness after spending time alone in daily life, whereas those with positive beliefs feel less lonely after spending time alone. Finally, multi-national studies demonstrate the generalizability of these results across nine countries spanning six continents (Studies 4 and 5, N = 2930). Together, these findings reveal the critical role of beliefs about being alone in shaping loneliness. Loneliness is a widespread problem that the media and public health campaigns frequently address.

Yet, we know little about what these strategy combinations look like, how they function, or how individual differences influence these phenomena. We addressed these issues in two, 2-week daily diary studies performed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 422; data collected April and September 2020). Each evening, participants rated their level of COVID-19 anxiety and indicated which of 18 emotion regulation strategies they used to manage it. There was tremendous diversity in the strategy combinations people used: 74% of the combinations were unique across participants and included strategies seldom studied together (e.g., exercise, journaling, social interaction, and cognitive reframing). On average, using a given strategy predicted same-day use of another strategy with only 1% accuracy. Despite this variability, a set of features consistently predicted effective regulation: Using large and healthy repertoires of strategies in diverse ways predicted reductions in anxiety over time. Psychologically distressed individuals experienced more daily anxiety and drew on a wider but more unhealthy set of strategies. However, when they used adaptive strategy combinations, they benefited just as much as less distressed individuals. These results illuminate the anatomy of people's emotion regulatory lives, underscoring the need to develop frameworks that capture the diverse ways people manage their emotions. They also identify specific mechanisms that interventions can target to improve how people manage their emotions under ecologically valid conditions.

Might this differ in cultural contexts that prioritize the self less? Prior research presents two compelling alternatives. On the one hand, collectivists may feel more intertwined with and tied to those close to them, thus protecting close others more. On the other hand, they may prioritize society over individuals and thus protect close others less. Four studies (N = 2,688) performed in the United States and Japan provide self-report, narrative, and experimental evidence supporting the latter hypothesis. These findings highlight how personal relationships and culture dynamically interact to shape how we think about important moral decisions.

We conducted a study that aimed to decrease drinking identity among college students with hazardous drinking. We adapted a writing task about the future self and tested whether three writing sessions could decrease drinking identity and change drinking. We also investigated whether two additional factors (writing perspective and inclusion of participants' social networks) would enhance task impact. The present study evaluated whether posited proximal cognitive and motivational outcomes (drinking identity, self‐efficacy, readiness to change, and drinking intentions) changed immediately after each writing session. Method The study is a randomized clinical trial in which hypotheses and analyses were pre‐registered. Participants were 328 college students who met hazardous drinking criteria. The study had a 2 (narrative writing topic: low‐risk drinker vs. reduced smartphone use) × 2 (writing perspective: first‐person vs. non‐first‐person) × 2 (social network instruction: instructed to include vs. not) factorial design. Proximal outcomes were drinking identity, self‐efficacy, readiness to change, and drinking intentions. The clinical outcome was alcohol consumption. Participants completed three laboratory sessions at weekly intervals that included the writing task and pre‐ and post‐task assessments. Results Results were largely null, except that readiness to reduce drinking was higher in the low‐risk drinker condition and increased over the lab sessions. Time effects indicated that reductions in drinking identity, drinking intentions, and alcohol consumption, and increases in self‐efficacy were observed but did not change above and beyond control conditions. Conclusions Findings indicate the need to strengthen the writing task and select a more appropriate control task to target proposed proximal outcomes. Future studies might try personalizing the task, evaluating its efficacy with individuals motivated to change their drinking, and using a control task that does not involve imagining a future self.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/acer.15326,https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.15326,2024.0,"Alcohol, Clinical and Experimental Research",ok,CR-title:Investigating cognitive and motivational proximal outcomes in a randomized clini,Investigating cognitive and motivational proximal outcomes in a randomized clinical trial of writing about the future self to reduce drinking,10.1111/acer.15326,,Goal 6,0.02444478570829278,False,

In a large cross-sectional sample ( N = 1,666; age: M = 49.44, SD = 21.55), age showed a moderate positive association with sense of purpose and a large negative association with anxiety symptoms. Sense of purpose was negatively associated with anxiety and showed moderate to strong associations with how people regulate their emotions in anxiety-inducing situations. Sense of purpose had the strongest associations with adaptive emotion-regulation strategies connected to perspective broadening: When they feel anxious, people with a higher sense of purpose were more likely to find a silver lining, focus on the big picture, and remember that the stressor will not last. Furthermore, sense of purpose moderated the relationship between age and three maladaptive emotion-regulation strategies (eating/drinking to cope, expressive suppression, and distraction). In particular, higher levels of sense of purpose correlated with a stronger negative relationship between age and the use of these strategies. We discuss the findings regarding integrating the purpose and emotion-regulation literature.",Crossref,91.66666666666667,10.1024/1662-9647/a000324,https://doi.org/10.1024/1662-9647/a000324,2024.0,GeroPsych,ok,CR-title:Sense of purpose and strategies for coping with anxiety across adulthood,Sense of Purpose and Strategies for Coping with Anxiety Across Adulthood,10.1024/1662-9647/a000324,,Goal 10,0.008012813693043543,False,

This question has been of philosophical interest for centuries, and, more recently, the focus of extensive empirical inquiry. Yet, extant research reveals a puzzle: some studies suggest that adopting a distanced perspective will produce more rationally self-interested behavior, whereas others suggest that it will produce more impartial behavior. Here we adjudicate between these perspectives by testing the effects of adopting a third-person perspective on decision making in a task that pits rational self-interest against impartiality: the dictator game. Aggregating across three experiments ( N = 774), participants who used third-person (i.e., distanced) vs. first-person (i.e., immersed) self-talk during the dictator game kept more money for themselves.

However, emerging evidence suggests that the active-passive distinction is too coarse to fully capture the relationship between SNS use and well-being. Here we describe the extended active-passive model of SNS use, which refines the original model in three ways: It decomposes active use, decomposes passive use, and crosses usage types with user characteristics. We describe recent empirical evidence illustrating the benefits of these three extensions and highlight important future research directions.

In Study 1a-b (N = 838) Spanish speakers used informal generic-you and the generic person marker “se” (but not formal-you) to express norms (vs. preferences). In Study 2 (N = 300), formal you, informal you, and impersonal “se” had persuasive force over personal endorsements (e.g., “I”), informing Spanish speaker’s interpretation of unfamiliar norms.

Prior work has shown that people can use emotions as tools in laboratory contexts, yet it is unclear whether people do use emotions as tools in daily life by intentionally trying to feel or express emotions that could yield context-specific beneficial outcomes. We examined this issue in 6 studies (total N = 1,409) in which participants (a) identified scenarios where specific emotions typically function as tools, (b) recalled episodes of emotional tool use, and (c) reported on emotional tool use in daily life via experience-sampling under experimental instructions. We found that people regularly used emotions as tools in daily life, but that people used positive emotions as tools much more frequently than negative emotions. Yet, when people used positive emotions as tools, this led to less beneficial outcomes than when participants felt positive emotions reactively-in part because using positive emotions as tools felt inauthentic-whereas using negative emotions as tools led to more beneficial outcomes than feeling negative emotions reactively. These findings point to a fascinating paradox: Although people are more willing to use positive (vs. negative) emotions as tools, these choices may not lead people to garner maximal possible benefits of positive emotions, while preventing people from capitalizing on the benefits of using negative emotions as tools. We discuss implications of this work for incorporating emotional tool use into theories of emotion regulation.

Furthermore, the perception that migrants make a valuable contribution to society and the experience of positive contacts with migrants are predictors of more favorable attitudes. In contrast, stronger national attachment, feelings of relative deprivation, perceived economic competition and cultural threats, and an authoritarian predisposition in which conformity to social norms is central, explain anti-immigrant sentiments. Additionally, the perception that immigrants are a burden on society and challenge the status quo, and the direct exposure to massive increase in arrivals of refugees, increase hostility towards newcomers. From a person x context interaction perspective, it can be expected that the role of these personal factors be not uniform. Psychological characteristics will matter more under some conditions than others. For example, people with an authoritarian predisposition are particularly prone to react with increased negativity towards culturally dissimilar immigrants (non-Western, Muslims), who are perceived as normative threatening, rather than towards culturally similar immigrants (Western, Christian). Another example is that people who have economic concerns and worries about crime are more negative towards Eastern European immigrants, whereas those who perceive cultural or terrorism-related threats have more negative views towards Muslim immigrants. Additionally, individual differences matter more for anti-immigrant attitudes when the proportion of immigrants is higher, the economic situation is declining, and the ideological climate in society is dominated by hierarchy enhancing and status quo preserving norms and values. Further, stronger national attachment tends to be associated with stronger anti-immigrant attitudes in non-settler countries, but not in settler countries in which cultural diversity is a constitutive norm of the national identity. Information about immigrants can invoke both feelings of threat and countervailing humanitarian concerns, whereby the former can override the latter, but also the latter can override the former. System justification motivations can be used by politicians and policy makers to garner support for refugees (e.g., “Open hearts and welcoming communities: it’s the Canadian way”). In general, research has demonstrated that people tend to overestimate the number of immigrants and refugees entering their country, and that subjective perceptions are much more important for people’s attitudes than actual changes and events. This means that how public policies are being framed and how immigrants are depicted in the media and by politicians is important. It matters whether newcomers are described as a potential threat to the host society or rather as making a valuable contribution and being in need of help. Apart from those with very strong positive or negative views about immigration, most people are struggling with the challenges and uncertainties that the arrival of large numbers of newcomers imply. Taking their concerns and doubts seriously is critical for broadening public support for immigration and refugee settlement. Public opposition to immigration can be a major social and political disruptive force and has negative implications for the opportunities of newcomers. Understanding what drives individuals to be positive or rather negative towards immigrants, and when and how the various psychological determinants become less or more important for their attitudes, is crucial for trying to avoid the divisive consequences of migration and increase the successful accommodation of newcomers. Mass immigration is a global phenomenon affecting most countries, and there is much at stake for societies, communities and individuals, including the mental health of newcomers.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),89.10891089108911,10.1002/wps.20820,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1fd2f8ccf844d25a4f31cff04c5a2c49ac591615,2021.0,World Psychiatry,ok,CR-title:The impact of social network sites on mental health: Distinguishing active from ,The impact of social network sites on mental health: distinguishing active from passive use,10.1002/wps.20820,,Goal 10,0.03532074906384528,False,migrant remittances; migrants; refugees

What happens when these tendencies collide—do people punish or protect close others who behave immorally? Across 10 studies ( N = 2,847), we show that people consistently anticipate protecting close others who commit moral infractions, particularly highly severe acts of theft and sexual harassment. This tendency emerged regardless of gender, political orientation, moral foundations, and disgust sensitivity and was driven by concerns about self-interest, loyalty, and harm. We further find that people justify this tendency by planning to discipline close others on their own. We also identify a psychological mechanism that mitigates the tendency to protect close others who have committed severe (but not mild) moral infractions: self-distancing.

Opens a new window","Extensive theoretical research demonstrates the pivotal role uncertainty plays in shaping a firm’s cost behavior. Our study contributes to this literature by conducting a comprehensive multivariate analysis of the inherent tension between the effects of price and demand uncertainty on cost elasticity and cost asymmetry. Using the occurrence of words implying uncertainty in forward-looking statements in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of 10-K reports to measure the managerial perception of the overall, price, and demand uncertainty, we provide evidence of a positive and significant association between price uncertainty and cost elasticity and a negative and significant association between demand uncertainty and cost elasticity. The former finding is consistent with managers’ desire to shift to a more elastic cost function in the face of high price uncertainty; the latter supports the hypothesis that firms facing demand uncertainty will increase their capacity of fixed resources to avoid disproportionately large production congestion costs associated with high demand realizations. We reconcile findings in prior studies by demonstrating that the association between demand uncertainty and cost elasticity is negative for manufacturing firms but is positive for firms in the healthcare sector. We also document that managerial perception of the overall uncertainty exacerbates the degree of cost asymmetry. Our empirical evidence supports the theoretical argument that the managerial perception of uncertainty and its components influences their resource allocation decisions, and suggests that any analysis of the relation between uncertainty and a firm’s cost behavior needs to be conducted in the context of a specific type of uncertainty and industry affiliation.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),91.58878504672897,10.2139/ssrn.3608218,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/90502a660392f1192dc28e5ea643abf4cfa1f4fd,2020.0,Social Science Research Network,ok,CR-title:The Managerial Perception of Uncertainty and Cost Elasticity Opens a new window,The Managerial Perception of Uncertainty and Cost Behavior,10.2139/ssrn.3608218,,Goal 9,0.01011019608072888,False,

These experiments inform behavioral theories of operations management, impacting domains including inventory, supply chain management, queuing, forecasting, and sourcing. Yet, until now, the replicability of most behavioral insights from these laboratory experiments has been untested. We remedy this with the first large-scale replication study in operations management. With the input of the wider operations management community, we identify 10 prominent experimental operations management papers published in Management Science, which span a variety of domains, to be the focus of our replication effort. For each paper, we conduct a high-powered replication study of the main results across multiple locations using original materials (when available and suitable). In addition, our study tests replicability in multiple modalities (in-person and online) due to laboratory closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, when a good supplier is scarce, the award announces which supplier is particularly good and may increase the cost of building and maintaining the relationship. This paper studies both positive and negative effects of a symbolic award and offers explanations on underlying behavioral mechanisms. Academic/practical relevance: We show that symbolic awards can effectively incentivize suppliers to provide high effort, improving a buyer’s bottom line. This is particularly relevant in cases in which certain aspects of a buyer–supplier relationship are not contractible and suppliers have discretion over the quality provided. The award format significantly influences the award’s effectiveness. Methodology: We develop a game-theoretical model that captures a supplier’s utility for the award in a competitive setting and test the predictions of the model with laboratory experiments. Results: Our experimental results confirm that private symbolic awards have motivating effects and lead to higher buyer profits. When the awards are public, this profit premium diminishes as buyers pay higher prices to get the good suppliers. When the buyer is given the option to make the award public or private, buyers prefer that awards are public over private, anticipating a negative supplier response to their choice of the private award format. Managerial implications: Expressing praise or gratitude for a supplier’s efforts can be highly beneficial for a buyer. However, when there is scarcity of good suppliers, buyers should expect increased competition and accompany the award with efforts to preserve the relationship. Finally, if buyers choose to offer a distinctive award format, private recognitions may be perceived as greedy or self-interested and backfire.",Crossref,97.67441860465117,10.1287/msom.2021.0974,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.0974,2022.0,Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Symbolic Awards in Buyer-Supplier Relations,Symbolic Awards in Buyer–Supplier Relations,10.1287/msom.2021.0974,,Goal 17,0.0228251920257017,False,

Sharing innovations would leave the supplier in a vulnerable position if the buyer were to exploit the information (e.g., by resharing the supplier’s innovation with competing suppliers). Anecdotal evidence from automotive suppliers tells us that the nature of a supplier-buyer relationship for the most part depends on who (e.g., a short-run-focused procurement manager or a long-term-focused engineer) manages the relationship. In this paper, we examine how the allocation of decision rights to short-run- and long-run-focused employees affects collaboration between the firms. To accomplish this, we model a relationship between a supplier and a buyer where the buyer is a dual decision maker, consisting of long-run- and/or short-run-focused employees. We characterize the equilibrium of this model and show that the frequency of collaborative outcomes is lowest when the procurement manager has full control and highest when the engineer has full control or in a setup where employees can unilaterally enforce collaboration. A laboratory experiment confirms that collaborations occur more frequently when a manager with a long-term focus is in charge of or actively involved in decision making. Depending on how joint control is structured, joint control can help or hurt collaboration: Collaboration is highest when employees can unilaterally enforce it, whereas the random joint-control case results in collaboration that is as low as in the procurement manager control case.

The design of equity split agreements has attracted considerable attention in the entrepreneurial community, with no convergence on a single preferred contract form. This paper experimentally examines the effectiveness of different contractual arrangements, focusing in particular on the effects of contract form and contracting timing on founder effort and on the value of the venture. Our results suggest that performance improves with the incentive strength of the contract, but they question the conventional logic that this effect is causal. Instead, we suggest a novel causal sequence. Rather than the contract form being the primitive and the behavior the derived consequence, our results suggest the reverse. The differences in contract performance are driven primarily by the sorting of high contributors into nonequal contracts and of low contributors into equal contracts; that is, equal contracts are bad for team performance not because of their incentive strength but because of the founder types that adopt them.

In theory, a number of different contracts can solve this issue and induce first-best investment levels by the supplier. In this study, we investigate the performance of these contracts in a two-tier supply chain. We develop an experimental design where retailers and suppliers bargain over contract terms—and have the ability to make multiple back-and-forth offers—while also providing feedback on the offers they receive. One key result from our study is that an option contract and a service-level agreement are best at increasing first-best investment levels and overall supply chain profits. However, these same contracts also generate the largest inequity in expected profits between the two parties. We find that both of these results are driven by the bargaining tendencies of retailers and suppliers, which we refer to as “superficial fairness.” In particular, retailers and suppliers place more emphasis on negotiating the wholesale price, while partially overlooking any secondary parameter, such that final wholesale prices end up roughly halfway between the retailer’s selling price and the supplier’s production cost. We show that this bargaining behavior contributes to higher investment levels observed in the option contract and service-level agreement, along with the inequitable payoffs.

Our treatments vary the cost differences between firms in tiers 1 and 2. We measure how these underlying costs influence the efficiency, negotiated prices, and profit distribution across the supply chain, as well as the consistency of these outcomes with existing theory. We find that the structural issue of cost differentials dominates personal characteristics in explaining outcomes, with profits in a tier generally increasing with decreased competition in the tier and increasing with decreased competition in alternate tiers. The balanced principal model of supply chain bargaining does a good job explaining our data, and it outperforms the common assumption of leader–follower negotiations. We find a significant anchoring effect from a firm’s first bid but no effect of the sequence of those bids, no evidence of failure to close via escalation of commitment, and mixed results for a deadline effect. We also find an interesting asymmetry between the buy and sell sides in employed bidding strategy. All firms make predominantly concessionary offers after the initial anchor; however, sell-side firms that engage in aggressive anticoncessionary bidding successfully increase prices while not compromising closure rates.

These shortcomings become particularly restrictive when the underlying substitution patterns get complex as the number of options increases. We provide a solution by developing a high-dimensional choice model that allows for flexible substitution patterns and easily scales up. We leverage consumer clickstream data and combine econometric and machine learning (graphical lasso, in particular) methods to learn the substitution patterns among a large number of products. We show our method offers more accurate demand forecasts in a wide range of synthetic scenarios when compared with classical models (e.g., the independent and identically distributed Probit model), reducing out-of-sample mean absolute percentage error by 10%–30%. Such performance improvement is further supported by observations from a real-world empirical setting. More importantly, our method excels in precisely recovering substitution patterns across products. Compared with benchmark models, it reduces the percentage deviation from the underlying elasticity matrix by approximately half. This precision serves as a critical input for enhancing business decisions such as assortment planning, inventory management, and pricing strategies.

Opens a new window","Problem definition: Education technology innovations, such as massive open online course (MOOC) platforms, could potentially enable a more inclusive learning environment by delivering education to traditionally disadvantaged learners, like women. However, inclusivity does not necessarily translate into equal treatment on the platform. We investigate whether female and male learners benefit equally from forum discussions—typically the only form of interaction available—in online learning platforms. Methodology/results: Utilizing a large-scale, interaction-level data set on 174 courses on Coursera, we uncover an economically sizable and statistically significant disparity between male and female learners in receiving responses to their posts in MOOC discussion forums. On average, female learners’ questions are 3.11 percentage points less likely to receive responses from teaching staff than male learners’ questions, which equals 15.2% of the female group average. We also find significant gender disparity in staff response quality and sentiments. We investigate possible mechanisms behind the gender disparity using new techniques, including textual analysis tools. We show that the disparity is not because of content differences in male and female learners’ posts, nor is it attributable to their linguistic styles or the reputation of the posters. Instead, our results are most consistent with a male-driven gender homophily mechanism; although female staff members are gender neutral in their interactions with learners, male staff members systemically prefer responding to posts from male learners. We additionally show that receiving staff response leads to significant improvement in course passing rates, particularly for female learners. Therefore, the unequal access to information through course forums unfavorably hinders female learners’ performance. Managerial implications: Our results provide operational and organizational suggestions to platforms and content providers, including degendering user identifiers, implementing a content-focused post recommendation system, incorporating a gender-neutral user reputation system, promoting the recruiting of female teaching staff, and providing staff training that highlights the importance of gender-neutral interactions.

(2) If they are, how do the best quality hospitals identified using patient-centric information differ from those identified using population-average information? (3) How much will hospitals’ pay-for-performance reimbursements change if their performance is measured based on patient-centric information? Methodology/results: Using patient-level data from 35 hospitals for six cardiovascular surgeries in New York State, we identify patient groups that exhibit significant differences in outcomes with a recently developed instrumental variable tree approach. We find outcome differences between hospitals are heterogeneous not only across procedure types, but also along other dimensions such as patient age and comorbidities. For around 80% of patients, the best quality hospitals indicated by patient-centric information are different from those indicated as best according to population-average information. Managerial implications: We compare potential outcomes when patients are treated at the best quality hospitals based on the two types of information and find complications could be reduced by using patient-centric information instead of population-average information. We also use our model to illustrate how patient-centric information can enhance pay-for-performance programs offered by payers and guide hospitals in targeting quality-improvement efforts.

Opens a new window","Understanding the drivers of market concentration in the generic pharmaceutical industry is essential to guaranteeing the availability of low-cost generics. In this paper, we develop a structural model to capture the multiple determinants governing manufacturers’ entry decisions; in particular, we focus on how manufacturing complexity and the regulatory environment for generics approval affect concentration in drug markets. We estimate the model using data collated from six disparate sources. We find that manufacturing complexity, as reflected in the number of active ingredients, for example, significantly reduces the likelihood of generics entry. Moreover, the delay in the review process for the generics applications significantly affects the number of firms entering a market. Our policy simulations suggest that a shortened drug approval review time significantly increases the average number of entrants per market and reduces the fraction of markets with no generics entry; however, a notable portion of markets would still lack any generic competition.

Opens a new window","This study addresses the ubiquitous challenge of using big observational data to identify heterogeneous treatment effects. This problem arises in precision medicine, targeted marketing, personalized education, and many other environments. Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects presents several analytical challenges including high dimensionality and endogeneity issues. We develop a new instrumental variable tree (IVT) approach that incorporates the instrumental variable method into a causal tree (CT) to correct for potential endogeneity biases that may exist in observational data. Our IVT approach partitions subjects into subgroups with similar treatment effects within subgroups and different treatment effects across subgroups. The estimated treatment effects are asymptotically consistent under a set of mild assumptions. Using simulated data, we show our approach has a better coverage rate and smaller mean-squared error than the conventional CT approach. We also demonstrate that an instrumental variable forest (IVF) constructed using IVTs has better accuracy and stratification than a generalized random forest. Finally, by applying the IVF approach to an empirical assessment of laparoscopic colectomy, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for endogeneity to make accurate comparisons of the heterogeneous effects of the treatment (teaching hospitals) and control (nonteaching hospitals) on different types of patients.

Opens a new window","The U.S. K–12 public education system has been notoriously hard to improve. Some argue new education technologies (EdTech) can help transform schools for the better. Yet, as large-scale policy reforms have had only limited success, it seems unlikely that small changes from EdTech could have any measurable impact. In this paper, we study DonorsChoose, a nonprofit that operates a teacher crowdfunding platform. We ask whether DonorsChoose improves educational outcomes, specifically at low-income schools. Combining DonorsChoose data with data on student test scores in Pennsylvania from 2012–2013 to 2017–2018, we find that an increase in the number of DonorsChoose projects funded at a school leads to higher student performance, after controlling for selection biases. For a school with zero funded projects, one funded project—of about $400 in value—translates to between two to nine more students scoring basic and above in all subjects in high school and science and language arts in primary and middle school. We find this effect is driven mostly by low-income schools, indicating funded projects help close the gap in educational outcomes between students at low- versus high-income schools. Based on a textual analysis of 20,000 statements from all funded teachers describing how project resources are used, we find two channels of improvement most effective in the lowest income schools. We demonstrate that, although DonorsChoose projects are small, they improve outcomes and reduce inequality because they come directly from frontline workers—teachers—who know most intimately the obstacles their students face and how to help.

Opens a new window","Policy makers in many developing countries use maximum price or markup policies to control pharmaceutical costs, which represent 20%–60% of their overall healthcare expenditure. We study the price effect of price ceiling policies by exploiting a major policy shift in China: the elimination of longstanding ceilings on retail drug prices. We collect weekly price and characteristics data on more than 4,500 drug stock keeping units (SKUs) from a leading pharmacy chain. By comparing the rate of discontinuous price jumps across drugs with and without price ceilings during the years before and after the policy change, we find that while price ceilings are effective in containing the prices of some drugs, they can lead to higher prices for others, particularly if the ceilings are set at the national level irrespective of local economic conditions. About 5% of nationally controlled drugs (or more than 125 drugs) had inflated prices because of price ceilings, with an average price inflation of 10%. We attribute this perverse price effect to focal point pricing and asymmetric information about production costs. Further supporting this view, we find the perverse price effect most prominent in lower-income regions where the centrally set price ceilings are arbitrarily high considering their poorer economic conditions. Moreover, drugs with highly concentrated production and less elastic demand face heightened risks of inflated prices under price ceilings. Finally, based on a sample of drugs with available price ceiling data, we find that drugs with manufacturer-specific ceilings are 100% more likely to be priced at or near their ceilings and 70% more likely to experience price drops once the ceilings are removed compared with other drugs with regular ceilings. Overall, this paper documents the unintended perverse effect of price ceilings in pharmaceutical markets and sheds lights on the ongoing debate of drug price regulation.

Opens a new window","Problem definition: Congestion pricing offers an appealing solution to urban parking problems—charging varying rates across time and space as a function of congestion may shift demand and improve allocation of limited resources. It aims to increase the accessibility of highly desired public goods and to reduce traffic caused by drivers who search for available parking spaces. At the same time, complex policies make it harder for consumers to make search-based decisions. We investigate the effect of congestion pricing on consumer and social welfare. Academic/practical relevance: This paper contributes to the theory and practice of the management of scarce resources in the public sector, where welfare is of particular interest. Methodologically, we contribute to the literature on structural estimation of dynamic spatial search models. Methodology: Using data from the City of San Francisco, both before and after the implementation of a congestion-pricing parking program, SFpark, we estimate the welfare implications of the policy. We use a dynamic spatial search model to structurally estimate consumers’ search costs, distance disutilities, price sensitivities, and trip valuations. Results: We find that congestion pricing increases consumer and social welfare by more than 4% and reduces search traffic by more than 10% in congested regions compared with fixed pricing. However, congestion pricing may hurt welfare in uncongested regions, in which the focus should be on increasing utilization. Moreover, an unnecessarily complex congestion-pricing scheme makes it difficult for consumers to make search-based decisions. We find that a simpler pricing policy may yield higher welfare than a complex one. Lastly, compared with a policy that imposes limits on parking durations, congestion pricing increases social welfare by allocating the scarce resource to consumers who value it most. Managerial implications: The insights from SFpark offer important implications for local governments that consider alternatives for managing parking and congestion and for public-sector managers who evaluate the tradeoffs between approaches to manage public resources.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.2834019,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd4cfcf1d404fbfe95281fd69b87234311f901de,2017.0,Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Welfare Implications of Congestion Pricing: Evidence from SFpark Opens a new win,Welfare Implications of Congestion Pricing: Evidence from SFpark,10.2139/ssrn.2834019,,Goal 11,0.05430979638962009,True,public transportation access; traffic congestion

We first document a baseline fact: a significant proportion of tier-2 suppliers are shared by tier-1 suppliers. We then construct two simple metrics to capture the degree of tier-2 sharing and disentangle its effect from tier-2 suppliers’ own risks. We show that the focal firms’ risk levels are significantly related to the proportion of shared tier-2 suppliers in their supply network, and the effect becomes monotonically stronger as their tier-2 suppliers become more highly shared. Finally, we uncover causal relationships behind these associations using a new source of exogenous, idiosyncratic risk events in an event study setting. We show that, as tier-2 suppliers are impacted by these events, focal firms experience negative abnormal returns, the magnitude of which is significantly larger when the impacted tier-2 suppliers are more heavily shared. Overall, our study uncovers the subtier network structure as an important risk source for the focal firm, with the degree of tier-2 sharing as the main moderator.

Then we measure the societal impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagements using participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as a proxy. We demonstrate a robust and striking difference between public and private firms: whereas private firms significantly reduce their negative ESG incident levels after UNGC engagements, public firms fail to do so and are more likely to engage in decoupled CSR actions—actions with no subsequent real impact. We then conduct a series of in-depth analyses to examine possible economic mechanisms. Our results are most consistent with shareholder–stakeholder conflicts of interest being the main moderator of decoupling. The intensity of this conflict is further moderated by three factors: ownership type, proximity to final consumers on the value chain, and specific ESG incident types. Other possible mechanisms, such as selective entry into UNGC and heterogeneities in media exposure, country representation, and entry timing, do not survive our analysis. Our results suggest that existing CSR engagements and one-size-fits-all CSR policy mandates might not necessarily lead to better societal outcomes, and a multi-tiered policy targeting different ownership and industry types might be more efficient at maximizing ex post ESG benefits.

Opens a new window","Market thickness is a key parameter that can make or break a platform’s business model. Thicker markets can offer more opportunities for participants to meet and higher chances that a potential match exists. However, they can also be vulnerable to potential search frictions. In this paper, using data from an online peer-to-peer holiday property rental platform, we aim to identify and measure the causal impact of market thickness on matching rates. In particular, we exploit an exogenous shock to market size caused by a one-time migration of listings from other platforms, which gives rise to a quasiexperimental design. We find that increased market thickness actually leads to lower matching rates. Keeping search technology and other factors constant, doubling market size leads to a 15.4% reduction in traveler confirmation rate and a 15.9% reduction in host occupancy rate. As a result, the platform lost 5.6% of potential matches because of the increased market size. We attribute the effect to increased search friction: travelers’ search intensity increases by 18.3% when market size doubles. This effect is especially prominent when the matching needs to take place within a limited time. Our results offer insights for future empirical and theoretical research on matching markets.

There are two key challenges to quantify these factors empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the absence of competitor sales information, which prevents efficient estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the second issue by exploiting the retailer's own and competitors' stockouts as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to variations in competitors' prices. We estimate an empirical model capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple retailers.

Academic/practical relevance: Existing healthcare provider quality information, which is almost exclusively based on population averages, cannot detect differences in the surgeon effect for patients with different characteristics or medical conditions. Consequently, such information may under-state or over-state the benefit to an individual patient of seeking out an elite physician. This paper develops methods to generate patient-specific quality information and analyzes the impact on enabling patients to receive better care. Methodology: Using mitral valve surgery as the clinical setting, we study the quality of 188 cardiac surgeons at 35 hospitals in New York State with respect to different quality metrics, including a new quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) metric that combines many of the short-term and long-term effects of traditional metrics. By combining a patient choice model that considers outcome quality, travel distance, and waiting time on the surgical schedule with a queueing model of patient waiting time, we translate our empirical results into estimates of the relative value of population-average and patient-specific quality information for improving overall patient outcomes. We formulate patients’ choice of surgeons as a queueing system to compare the value of using population-average and patient-specific quality information to help patients find better care. Results: We observe that patients of different demographics and levels of acuity benefit differently from elite surgeons. We estimate that the societal benefits (i.e., the total patient utility) from using patient-specific information are comparable to those achievable by enabling the best surgeons to treat 10%–20% more patients under population-average information.

Opens a new window","We posit and find evidence consistent with a new mechanism of intra-firm enforcement spillovers: the leakage of scarce compliance resources across facilities within a firm. Using a facility-level panel data set of Clean Air Act (CAA) enforcement actions from 2005 to 2017, we find a facility is more likely to violate the CAA following penalties on its same-industry-same-state siblings. In contrast, there is no significant spillover across firms. We show that the intra-firm spillover is not due to changes in regulatory attention or production shifting.

Using a mixed methods approach, we study Millennials’ driving behaviours, focusing on the role of generation cohorts as field actors. Combining in‐depth qualitative analysis with an original nationwide survey ( N = 2,225) we find that Millennials exhibit significantly different driving behaviour than earlier generations, driving for roughly 8 per cent fewer trips. These differences are primarily due to their attitudes, not, as commonly presumed, socio‐economic factors. Our results contribute to theory on fields and collective actors. First, we identify a new field phenomenon, correlated groups , uncoordinated actors behaving as collective agents due to shared experiences and characteristics. Second, we identify four mechanisms through which correlated groups impact fields: correlated imprinting, cohorts as conduit, cohort myth apathy, and cohort myth creation .",Crossref,98.80952380952381,10.1111/joms.12606,https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.12606,2020.0,Journal of Management Studies,ok,CR-title:The Millennial `Meh’: Correlated Groups as Collective Agents in the Automobile F,The Millennial ‘Meh’: Correlated Groups as Collective Agents in the Automobile Field,10.1111/joms.12606,,Goal 1,0.0221978960175644,False,

However, recent evidence has emerged showing that industry-backed groups often attempt to undermine the credibility of such NGOs and weaken their ability to influence policy. To investigate the mechanisms by which a firm can profitably create doubt about scientific information, we use a signaling model of interest-group lobbying in which the policymaker has fixed costs of taking action. We explore two mechanisms for the creation of doubt. The first involves using Bayesian persuasion to imply that the NGO may be a radical extremist whose lobbying is not credible. The second involves the creation of a think tank which can offer its own testimony on scientific matters. We show the firm prefers that the think tank does not act as a credible moderate, but instead sometimes takes radical, non-credible, positions.

Research suggests that RPSs are supported by Democratic legislatures in states with good solar and wind potential, are more likely in states with restructured electricity markets, and are less likely in states heavily dependent on natural gas for electricity generation.

Among the many different empirical models applied for such investigations, the most common class of model is the linear-in-means model. These models can be used to examine whether social influence is truly a result of agents affecting each other through their choices simultaneously (endogenous effect) or of having similar taste and characteristics (homophily). However, the two effects are not separately identified in general in the standard linear-in-means model unless data on all members of an individual’s network are available. With data on a sample of individuals from a network, these effects are not identified. In this research, we leverage a very natural aspect of social settings, namely that consumers are usually part of multiple—as opposed to single—networks. We discuss the sufficient conditions for identification when the standard linear-in-means model is extended to allow for multiple sources of social influence. We also show how the additional variation generated by more than one source of social influence actually allows estimation of endogenous effects with sample data. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach via simulation and on the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health data, which has been used in a number of studies examining social influence. Our approach is, therefore, likely to be useful in typical marketing settings.

To curb inappropriate financial relationships between health care providers and firms, several state laws require firms to publicly declare the payments they make to physicians. In 2013, this disclosure law was rolled out to all 50 states. The authors investigate the causal impact of this increased transparency on subsequent payments between firms and physicians. While firms and physicians were informed of the disclosure regulation at data collection, complete transparency did not occur until the data were published online. The authors estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of the online data disclosure exploiting the phased rollout of the disclosure laws across states, facilitated by recent advances in machine learning methods. Using a 29-month national panel covering $100 million in payments between 16 antidiabetic brands and 50,000 physicians, the authors find that the monthly payments changed insignificantly, on average, due to disclosure. However, the average null effect masks some unintended consequences of disclosure, wherein payments may have increased for more expensive drugs and among physicians who prescribed more heavily.

Car sharing firms offer a menu of pricing plans to make this happen. The two most common plans are flat-rate and pay-per-use pricing. However, little is known about how consumers choose among these pricing plans. In this study, we analyze consumers' choices between pay-per-use and flat-rate pricing using data from a car sharing provider in a large European city. In contrast to previous research, we find a prevalent and time-persistent pay-per-use bias. Specifically, depending on the definition of the bias, 21% to 32% of customers exhibit this bias. This bias also persists over time within customer. We propose three potential explanations for the existence and persistence of this bias. First, we suggest that customers underestimate their usage. Second, we propose that customers have a preference for flexibility, leading them to pay more. Finally, we show that the physical context, such as weather, increases the likelihood of a pay-per-use bias.

However, there is little empirical work documenting the costs and benefits of bargaining, primarily because of the lack of real-world bargaining data. We leverage rich, transaction-level bargaining data from a major online platform and supplement it with primary data to quantify the costs and benefits of bargaining for sellers, buyers, and the platform. We do this by building a structural model of buyer demand and seller pricing decisions while allowing for the existence of bargaining initiation cost, loss-of-face cost, and price discrimination. Using our results, we perform three policy simulations to quantify the importance of not distinguishing between no-bargain and failed-bargain transactions, ignoring the loss-of-face cost, and not allowing for bargaining. These simulations provide rich details on how the various costs of bargaining impact our understanding of buyer and seller behavior and transaction outcomes.

While the premise behind paywalls is that the subscription revenue can be a new source of income, the externalities that might arise from this pricing change are unclear. The authors study two potential externalities of newspaper paywalls: (1) the effect of a paywall on the engagement of its online reader base and (2) the spillover effect on the print version of the newspaper. The engagement effect considers how the paywall altered the various engagement metrics among light and heavy readers of online news. The spillover effect is likely to arise if readers view print and online versions of a newspaper as substitutes, implying that increasing the price of the latter is likely to increase the demand for the former. Moreover, many newspaper paywalls offer bundles wherein print subscribers are provided free access to the online newspaper. Therefore, the value that a reader derives from the print subscription could be higher after the erection of the paywall. As a result, paywalls are likely to have a positive spillover effect on print subscription and, consequently, circulation. The authors document the sizes of the two externalities for the New York Times paywall and compare them with the direct subscription revenue generated.

We estimate the model using a data set containing detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers' playing histories over 29 months. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of achievement and need for challenge. For example, a higher per-period total score (achievement) increases the engagement of gamers in a low or high engagement state but not those in a medium engagement state; gamers in a low or medium engagement state enjoy within-period score variation (challenge), but those in a high engagement state do not. In the second stage, we develop a matching algorithm that learns (predicts) the gamer's current engagement state on the fly and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play.

This is especially true in countries such as China, which are experiencing a big rush toward e-commerce. The emergence of such platforms gives researchers the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of such platforms by focusing on the growth of both buyers and sellers. In this research, we build a utility-based model to quantify both cross and direct network effects on Alibaba Group’s Taobao.com, the world’s largest online C2C platform (based in China). Specifically, we investigate the relative contributions of different factors that affect the growth of buyers and sellers on the platform. Our results suggest that the direct network effects do not play a big role in the platform’s growth (we detect a small positive direct network effect on buyer growth and no direct network effect on seller growth). More importantly, we find a significant, large and positive cross-network effect on both sides of the platform. In other words, the installed base of either side of the platform has propelled the growth of the other side (and thus the overall growth). Interestingly, this cross-network effect is asymmetric with the installed base of sellers having a much larger effect on the growth of buyers than vice versa. The growth in the number of buyers is driven primarily by the seller’s installed base and product variety with increasing importance of product variety. The growth in the number of sellers is driven by buyer’s installed base, buyer quality, and product price with increasing importance of buyer quality. We also investigate the nature of these cross-network effects over time. We find that the cross-network effect of sellers on buyers increases and then decreases to reach a stable level. By contrast, the cross-network effect of buyers on sellers is relatively stable. We discuss the policy implications of these findings for C2C platforms in general and Taobao in particular.

Building from a contingency perspective that considers the impact of contextual factors, we propose that collective charismatic leadership will be associated with lowered unit conflict, and this relationship will be strengthened by the contingency elements of individual charismatic leadership, task complexity, and social inclusion. Furthermore, we propose that the interactions of collective charismatic leadership with these contextual factors will relate to performance and satisfaction through conflict. We examine our hypotheses across two unit-level field studies, and the results illustrated that high levels of these contextual factors enhanced the negative relationship between collective charismatic leadership and conflict, which generally mediated the relationships between these interactive effects and performance and satisfaction. The results also highlight the detrimental aspects of collective leadership and how it can relate to reduced unit functioning when it is not aligned with an appropriate context.

However, research in this area has tended to focus on leaders’ direct influence over subordinate behavior, such as through role modeling or eliciting positive social exchange. We extend this research by examining how ethical leaders affect how employees construe morally problematic decisions, ultimately influencing their behavior. Across four studies, diverse in methods (lab and field) and national context (the United States and China), we find that ethical leadership decreases employees’ propensity to morally disengage, with ultimate effects on employees’ unethical decisions and deviant behavior. Further, employee moral identity moderates this mediated effect. However, the form of this moderation is not consistent. In Studies 2 and 4, we find that ethical leaders have the largest positive influence over individuals with a weak moral identity (providing a “saving grace”), whereas in Study 3, we find that ethical leaders have the largest positive influence over individuals with a strong moral identity (catalyzing a “virtuous synergy”). We use these findings to speculate about when ethical leaders might function as a “saving grace” versus a “virtuous synergy.” Together, our results suggest that employee misconduct stems from a complex interaction between employees, their leaders, and the context in which this relationship takes place, specifically via leaders’ influence over employees’ moral cognition.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),99.05660377358491,10.1037/apl0000341,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50171269cc3baadbb9bf6134d167b5ff20e03b71,2019.0,Journal of Applied Psychology,ok,CR-title:Leaders matter morally: The role of ethical leadership in shaping employee moral,Leaders matter morally: The role of ethical leadership in shaping employee moral cognition and misconduct.,10.1037/apl0000341,,Goal 16,0.006546408760345387,False,

In contrast to prior work finding that employees believe it is best to use economic language to influence management to address social issues, we draw on the issue selling, persuasion, and behavioral ethics literatures to demonstrate that moral language is actually most influential-especially when the language is framed to align with the organization's values and/or mission. The results from a combination of 3 field survey studies and 1 experimental vignette study provide support for this hypothesis. In addition, we find support for obligation (i.e., manager's anticipated guilt), rather than inspiration (i.e., manager's prosocial motivation), as a mediator of this interactive effect.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a trickle-down model and examine the mediating role of supervisor ethical leadership and the moderating role of perceived organizational distributive justice in the CSR-OCB relationship. Design/methodology/approach To test the arguments, the authors collected field data in four companies located in a central city of China. Through a multi-wave data collection design, a total of 187 employees reported their perceptions toward firms’ CSR and organizational justice at Time 1, and reported their direct supervisors’ ethical leadership behaviors, and their own OCBs at Time 2 (four weeks later). Findings Empirical findings demonstrated that CSR had a positive effect on employee OCB, as mediated by supervisors’ ethical leadership. In addition, this mediation effect was found to be moderated by perceived organizational distributive justice such that the mediation relationship was stronger when perceived organizational distributive justice was lower than when it was higher. Originality/value The present study makes three major contributions. First, it contributes to the CSR literature by revealing the underlying mechanism of ethical leadership through which CSR will lead to increased employee OCB in the workplace. Second, the moderation findings of the study add a new piece of empirical evidence suggesting the boundary condition of organizational distributive justice affecting the positive effect of CSR on employee OCB. Finally, the trickle-down theoretical model demonstrates the pivotal role of leadership in transforming CSR into positive employee outcomes, providing valuable insights into future research that examines why CSR motivates in-organization employees at work.",Crossref,81.48148148148148,10.1108/md-05-2016-0284,https://doi.org/10.1108/md-05-2016-0284,2017.0,Management Decision,ok,CR-title:Sending a clear signal: The joint effects of corporate social responsibility and,Corporate social responsibility and employee organizational citizenship behavior,10.1108/md-05-2016-0284,,Goal 16,0.03347194991808932,False,

We analyze the pay gap between executives and employees, focusing on three components: executive pay premium relative to industry peers; employee pay premium; and average pay gap at the industry level. We examine how the executive and employee pay premium components of the pay gap drive firm performance. On one hand, economic theories of matching and managerial talent suggest talented executives who generate relatively better firm performance receive wage premiums, implying a positive relation between pay gap and performance. On the other hand, sociological theories suggest that the inequity implied by a larger pay gap lowers firm performance by adversely affecting employee morale and productivity. To test these alternative theories, we utilize pay gap data from China that provides a setting with strong national preferences towards social equity but also with a scarcity of experienced managers and abundance of low‐cost labour. Our results strongly support the economic theories—firm performance is largely driven by pay premium for executive talent. Additional tests using a smaller sample of US firms with pay gap data are consistent with our primary findings.

We also find that when firms do experience an activist campaign, firms with IR engagement have less costly and contentious campaigns, including a lower likelihood of CEO turnover, than those without such a commitment. Taken together, our findings suggest that direct and ongoing IR engagement is an important factor in achieving mutual understanding and trust between the firm and its shareholders, which deters activist investors and mitigates the costly escalation of initiated campaigns.

To identify instances of activism via voting, we focus on annual meetings with at least one ballot item where a substantial fraction of shareholders is expected to vote against management's voting recommendation, indicating an increase in their monitoring activity. We define such meetings as “contentious.” Using a sample of almost 28,000 meetings between 2003 and 2012, we examine stock returns over the period between the proxy filing and the annual meeting. This period captures when investors learn about the contentious nature of the upcoming meeting and form expectations about its likely impact on firms' policies. We find that abnormal stock returns prior to contentious meetings are significantly positive and higher than those prior to noncontentious meetings. These higher abnormal returns increase with the contentiousness of the meeting; are more pronounced in firms with poor past performance, which are more likely to respond to shareholder pressure; and persist after controlling for firm‐specific news and proxies for risk factors. Our results are consistent with investors' expecting activism via voting to have a positive impact on firm value, on average, and cast doubts on regulatory attempts to restrict the use of shareholder votes.",Crossref,94.38202247191012,10.1111/1911-3846.12705,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12705,2021.0,Contemporary Accounting Research,ok,CR-title:Investors' Perceptions of Activism via Voting: Evidence from Contentious Shareho,Investors' Perceptions of Activism via Voting: Evidence from Contentious Shareholder Meetings*,10.1111/1911-3846.12705,,Goal 10,0.009988339243924683,False,

We find that firms with IR officers have lower stock price volatility, lower analyst forecast dispersion, higher analyst forecast accuracy, and quicker price discovery, consistent with IR officers aiding market participants in their assimilation of firm information. We also show that our findings are stronger for firms with longer-tenured IR officers. Finally, we find that when firms transition from a long-tenured IR officer to a new IR officer, stock price volatility increases, analyst forecasts become more disperse and less accurate, and the price discovery process slows, despite no significant change in the firm's disclosures, media coverage, or performance around the turnover. Collectively, these findings suggest that in-house IR officers, particularly those with greater experience, help facilitate information assimilation by the market, which has positive market effects.

The effect of ethnic heritage is observed in dialogues that reflect real-time interactions (i.e., Q&A ) and is less pronounced in the scripted, less spontaneous portion of the calls (i.e., management discussion). Analysts respond positively to optimistic tone, but only those who share the manager's ethnic background adjust their earnings forecasts for the cultural component of managerial tone.

Using data from the nationally representative Health Reform Monitoring Survey, we provide new evidence on trends in coverage and access to care for LGBT and non-LGBT adults between 2013 and 2019. In 2013 LGBT adults were significantly less likely than non-LGBT adults to have insurance coverage and more likely to report difficulty obtaining necessary medical care.

Critics are concerned that drug firms are distorting prescribing behavior away from the best interests of patients, while defenders of the practice claim that payments arise from the need to educate providers about changing drug technologies. Using two different identification strategies, we investigate the effect of payments from drug firms on individual-level prescribing behavior in Medicare Part D. We find that individuals whose providers receive payments from a drug firm tend to increase expenditure on the firm's products. Our method accounts for the selection of physicians into payments (which may result if, e.g., pharmaceutical firms target payments to physicians who see a large number of patients) and our finding holds even when we look over time within individuals who change providers. However, using hand-collected efficacy data on four major therapeutic classes, we find that those receiving payments also prescribe higher-quality drugs on average. In addition, we examine four case studies of major drugs going off patent. Providers receiving payments from the firms experiencing the patent expiry transition their patients just as quickly to generics as prescribers who do not receive such payments. These results suggest that, absent other interventions to facilitate education, policies such as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act may reduce the efficacy of drugs prescribed.",Semantic Scholar,100.0,10.2139/ssrn.2663681,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03dbb7a7bd47552f93f2fac891ae2665b3a38009,2015.0,Journal of Public Economics,ok,CR-title:Drug Firms' Payments and Physicians' Prescribing Behavior in Medicare Part D,Drug Firms' Payments and Physicians' Prescribing Behavior in Medicare Part D,10.3386/w26751,,Goal 4,0.02862717938801261,False,

Our setting is one in which the firm chooses a personalized price based on each new customer's vector of individual features; the true set of individual demand-generating parameters is unknown to the firm and so must be estimated from historical data. We extend this classical framework of personalized pricing by requiring also that the firm's pricing policy preserve consumer privacy, or (formally) that it be differentially private -- an industry standard for privacy preservation. The two settings we consider are theoretically and practically relevant: central and local models of differential privacy, which differ in the strength of the privacy guarantees they provide. For both models, we develop privacy-preserving personalized pricing algorithms and derive the theoretical bounds on their performance as measured by the firm's revenue. Our analyses suggest that, if the firm possesses a sufficient amount of historical data, then it can achieve central differential privacy at a cost of the same order as the ""classical"" loss in revenue due to estimation error. Comparing the two models, we conclude that local differentially private personalized pricing yields better privacy guarantees but leads to much greater revenue loss by the firm.

Opens a new window","Problem definition: We study customer-centric privacy management in service systems. Academic/practical relevance: We explore the consequences of extended control over personal information by customers in such systems. Methodology: We adopt a stylized queueing model to capture a service environment that features a service provider and customers who are strategic in deciding whether to disclose personal information to the service provider—that is, customers’ privacy or information disclosure strategy. A customer’s service request can be one of two types, which affects service time but is unknown when customers commit to a privacy strategy. The service provider can discriminate among customers based on their disclosed information by offering different priorities. Results: Our analysis reveals that, when given control over their personal data, strategic customers do not always choose to withhold them. We find that control over information gives customers a tool they can use to hedge against the service provider’s will, which might not be aligned with the interests of customers. More importantly, we find that under certain conditions, giving customers full control over information (e.g., by introducing a privacy regulation) may not only distort already efficiently operating service system but might also backfire by leading to inferior system performance (i.e., longer average wait time), and it can hurt customers themselves. We demonstrate how a regulator can correct information disclosure inefficiencies through monetary incentives to customers and show that providing such incentives makes economic sense in some scenarios. Finally, the service provider itself can benefit from customers being in control of their personal information by enticing more customers joining the service. Managerial implications: Our findings yield insights into how customers’ individually rational actions concerning information disclosure (e.g., granted by a privacy regulation) can lead to market inefficiencies in the form of longer wait times for services. We provide actionable prescriptions, for both service providers and regulators, that can guide their choices of a privacy and information management approach based on giving customers the option of controlling their personal information.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2022.1130,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.1130,2022.0,Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Privacy Management in Service Systems Opens a new window,Privacy Management in Service Systems,10.1287/msom.2022.1130,,Goal 16,0.01809890287677332,False,privacy rights

Our model accommodates customers who are heterogeneous in their number of friends (degree) and their proclivity for social comparisons (conspicuity). Firms with information on either (or both) of these characteristics can use it to make the product selectively available and to personalize prices. We find that firms’ preferred customers are low degree and high conspicuity, with the conspicuity threshold nondecreasing in degree. Interestingly, although both degree and conspicuity levels are relevant to curating the desired customer base, we find that firms do not need conspicuity information to do so; its absence can be substituted by incentivizing customers to self-select. There is no such recourse for the absence of degree information. As a result, degree information is typically more valuable than conspicuity information. Our analysis suggests that there are two canonical categories of social information—less valuable “consonant” information on characteristics where firm and customer preferences are aligned and more valuable “competing” information where preferences are misaligned.

Agents use social learning to uncover an unknown state of the world, and a principal strategically injects misinformation into the network to distort this learning process. A subset of agents throughout the network is endowed with knowledge of the true state. This gives rise to a natural definition of inequality: privileged communities have unrestricted access to these agents, whereas marginalized communities do not. We show that the role that this inequality plays in the spread of misinformation is highly complex. For instance, communities who hoard resources and deny them to the larger population can end up exposing themselves to more misinformation. Conversely, although more inequality generally leads to worse outcomes, the prevalence of misinformation in society is nonmonotone in the level of inequality. This implies that policies that decrease inequality without substantially reducing it can leave society more vulnerable to misinformation.

In this paper, we capture sophistication by studying how misinformation affects the two canonical models of the social learning literature: sophisticated (Bayesian) and naive (DeGroot) learning. We show that sophisticated agents can be more likely to fall for misinformation. Our model helps explain several experimental and empirical facts from cognitive science, psychology, and the social sciences. It also shows that the intuitions developed in a vast social learning literature should be approached with caution when making policy decisions in the presence of misinformation.

As one of the world's largest capital pools, pension funds have a particularly important role to play in sustainable investing practices. In this article, I examine the U.S. requirement that fiduciaries of private‐sector pension plans must maximize financial returns without regard to the negative externalities those investments may create. Other countries, including South Africa, the original leader in sustainable pension investments, take a different approach. I make four major contributions in this article. First, I engage in a thorough literature review and identify the major strands of disagreement on whether U.S. fiduciaries may integrate ESG (environmental, social, and governance) factors into investment decision making. Second, I analyze whether the very different applications of fiduciary obligations (the implementing rules) on ESG investing in the United States and South Africa are attributable to the underlying legal systems. Comparison of common law and civil law shows that the underlying systems do not explain the differences in implementing rules. Third, I trace the source of the U.S. implementing rules to understand the motivations of the U.S. applications, and I do the same for South Africa. I determine that differences in the development of those rules provide the best explanation for their approaches.

Evidence shows that careful use of default decision settings and nudges can prevent decisional errors and encourage behavior that aligns with public policy while retaining individual power of choice. Indeed, even the Swedish National Academy of Sciences highlighted the effect of his behavioral science work on retirement savings when it awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in economics to Professor Richard Thaler. This article shows, though, that, unlike the three plan default settings attributed to behavioral science insights, the default setting that I term automatic retention fails. That failure means too many savers take affirmative actions to move (rollover) assets from their 401(k) plans to individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Primarily because of rollovers, IRAs hold more than 11.5% of U.S. household financial assets. However, usually the decision to roll over is not an optimal choice for the saver. This last mile problem undermines the goal of the first three default settings to help employees build long‐term retirement savings. This article examines research on what causes default settings to be slippery, as is the case for automatic retention, instead of sticky, as is the case for the other 401(k) default settings. It then evaluates three categories of potential interventions to mitigate the popularity of rollovers: aggressive regulation, expansion of fiduciary obligation, and use of incremental impeding altering rules. It concludes that adoption of incremental impeding altering rules would be both politically feasible and effective in increasing the stickiness of the automatic retention default setting.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/ablj.12150,https://doi.org/10.1111/ablj.12150,2019.0,American Business Law Journal,ok,CR-title:How Behavioral Science Ultimately Fails Retirement Savers: A Noble Experiment,How Behavioral Science Ultimately Fails Retirement Savers: A Noble Experiment,10.1111/ablj.12150,,Goal 17,0.01569548551707307,False,financial commitments; financial resources

We show that managers respond to shocks by lending and borrowing workers in a manner consistent with relational contracting, but many potentially beneficial transfers are unrealized.

Opens a new window","Using Census microdata on 28,000 manufacturing plants, we examine how firms manage employee retention concerns. In response to reductions in the local unemployment rate, plants take additional steps beyond increasing compensation. First, plants adjust bonus architecture to ensure bonuses can be paid. Second, plants offer more agency to employees by deploying high-involvement work practices that generate longer-term commitment. Third, plants pull these retention levers less when they have high availability and use of data as this reduces the adverse effects of employee turnover on organizational knowledge. These results are robust to using the fracking revolution as a shock increasing firms’ retention concerns. Additionally, we observe that although compensation increases tend to spill over to other plants within the same firm—aligning with theories of inequity aversion—adjustments to bonus architecture and the provision of employee agency do not, suggesting these may be more cost-effective strategies for multiplant firms.

Opens a new window","ABSTRACT We examine the relation between public firm presence and import competition. The information created by public firm presence may provide importers with insights they can use for competing with domestic firms. Consistent with this possibility, we document a positive relation between public firm presence and import competition. We find similar results when using differences in the expected costs of the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act as a source of plausibly exogenous variation in public firm presence after the act. We use differences in the proportion of German firms reporting publicly around a major enforcement reform as a natural mechanism experiment, and find evidence that financial reporting is a channel through which public firm presence relates to import competition. Additional mechanism tests and a falsification test estimated in the United Kingdom, where public and most private firms report publicly, further support this inference. In total, our evidence is consistent with foreign competitors using the information created by public firm presence, including what public firms disclose in financial reports, to compete with domestic firms. Consequently, our results provide evidence of competitors using the proprietary information disclosed in financial reports to compete with the disclosing firms and of information frictions affecting trade.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12411,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12411,2022.0,Journal of Accounting Research,ok,"CR-title:Public Firm Presence, Financial Reporting, and the Decline of U.S. Manufacturing","Public Firm Presence, Financial Reporting, and the Decline of U.S. Manufacturing",10.1111/1475-679x.12411,,Goal 17,0.03241700735246489,False,

Yesim Orhun,Frugality is Hard to Afford,"Intertemporal savings strategies, such as bulk buying or accelerating purchase timing to take advantage of a good deal, provide long-term savings in exchange for an increase in immediate spending. Although households with limited financial resources stand to benefit the most from these strategies, they are less likely to make use of them. The authors provide causal evidence that liquidity constraints impede low-income households’ ability to use these strategies, above and beyond the impact of other constraints. Exploiting recurring variation in household liquidity, this study shows that when low-income households have more liquidity, they partially catch up to higher-income households’ ability to use intertemporal savings strategies. The findings provide guidance to marketing managers and researchers regarding targeted promotional design and measurement of deal-proneness. For policy makers, they suggest a new path for decreasing the higher prices low-income households have been documented to pay for everyday goods. Policies have traditionally focused on increasing financial literacy or access to supermarkets.

Yesim Orhun,How Price Dispersion Changes when Upgrades are Introduced: Theory and Empirical Evidence from the Airline Industry,"This paper studies the effect of introducing a new vertical differentiation strategy, paying for an upgrade to a premium product after purchasing the base product, on the price dispersion of the base product arising from existing price discrimination strategies. In particular, we examine how a major U.S. airline’s price dispersion in the coach cabin changes after introducing the option to upgrade to a new type of premium economy seating within the coach cabin. We first provide a theoretical analysis that highlights two competing pressures that the new premium economy seating upgrades created on coach class prices. On the one hand, the airline benefits from lowering its prices because by allowing more customers to purchase in the first place, it increases the probability of selling upgrades (admission effect). On the other hand, for some customers, the value of flying with the airline increases because of the upgrade availability, therefore the airline may find it optimal to increase its prices (valuation effect). In the second part of the paper, we conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of upgrade introduction on coach class prices, based on a proprietary transaction-level data set from a major U.S. airline company. The empirical analysis tests the main predictions of our theoretical model and examines further nuances. The results show that the introduction of the premium economy seating upgrades is associated with an increase in the price dispersion and revenues in the coach class, the admission effect is stronger than the valuation effect on the low end of the price distribution, and the opposite is true on the high end of the price distribution. Finally, we discuss implications of our results for firm revenues and consumer welfare.

Yesim Orhun,Impact of Competition on Product Decisions: Movie Choices of Exhibitors,"We empirically study the impact of the entry of a new theater on two important product decisions that incumbents in the movie exhibition industry face: (1) whether to invest in screening movies that are expected to be popular, and (2) when to adopt new releases. For theaters, both of these decisions feature a cost-demand trade-off inherent in quality decisions: Although screening popular and recent movies brings more patrons to the theater, distributors take a higher share of the revenue for such movies. The impact of competitive entry on the incumbent’s quality decisions is ambiguous, as it may simultaneously increase the competitive pressure to invest more in these dimensions of quality and also change the demand conditions that incumbents face. We find that incumbent theaters do not increase the provision of popular and recent movies in response to rival entry. To identify the role of competitive incentives, we study the differential impact of entry based on whether the entrant belongs to the same parent firm as the incumbent theaters. This comparison reveals that competitive incentives push incumbents to screen movies with high expected success more frequently and to adopt movies sooner. The product responses we document have important implications for the revenue impact of entry and the conclusions that researchers can draw from this impact. Ignoring the provision of these quality dimensions suggests cannibalization to exceed business stealing, a conclusion that is reversed when we account for endogenous product responses. We also show that our findings on popularity and recency cannot be explained by concomitant changes in theaters’ other product decisions, such as the variety of movies screened.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/mksc.2015.0909,https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0909,2016.0,Marketing Science,ok,CR-title:Impact of Competition on Product Decisions: Movie Choices of Exhibitors,Impact of Competition on Product Decisions: Movie Choices of Exhibitors,10.1287/mksc.2015.0909,,Goal 8,0.006803414225694158,False,

Opens a new window","Policy makers and international institutions have long maintained that the global business environment is best supported when countries harmonize by adopting substantially uniform legal structures. This is particularly true in the context of intellectual property rights. When such national systems are similar, we believe that investment is undergirded and market participation is facilitated. However, this assumption may be incorrect in some cases. Marginal disharmony in certain intellectual property rights may provide countries space for experimentation while not impeding effective management of global intellectual property portfolios at the firm level. As evidence, we look to the utility model. This long‐standing form of invention right is conspicuously and surprisingly unstandardized across the world, yet our analysis, using PATSTAT data, reveals that firms are able to negotiate this disharmony effectively. We employ a novel empirical method that tracks U.S.‐priority patents to establish that firms use utility models to optimize their overall appropriability needs by region. Our study finds evidence that a firm may choose standard patent protection in one region and utility model protection in another, even though standard patent protection is available in both settings. We propose that a “zone of appropriability preference” exists when utility models and standard patents overlap, and this zone provides important strategic opportunities to firms with global intellectual property portfolios. Our study thus provides an important counter‐case for harmonization of national intellectual property laws. As a result, we suggest that such efforts be undertaken with more caution; in some cases, harmonization may do more harm than good.",Crossref,90.07633587786259,10.1111/ablj.12190,https://doi.org/10.1111/ablj.12190,2021.0,American Business Law Journal,ok,CR-title:Is Legal Harmonization Always Better?

This design allows us to identify the direction of any behavioral spillover. Our results show that participants exhibit both behavioral spillover and cognitive load effects. First, for pairs of Prisoners’ Dilemma and Alternation games, we find that subjects apply strategies from the historical game when playing the new game. Second, we find that those who participate in a Self Interest game as either their historical or new game achieve Pareto efficient outcomes more often in the Prisoners’ Dilemma and Alternation games compared to their control counterparts.

In our framework, tools differ in their likelihood of solving the problem at hand; agents, who may be of different types, vary in their skill at using tools. We establish baseline hiring rules when a manager can dictate tool choice and then derive results for strategic tool choice by team members. We highlight three main findings: First, that cognitively diverse teams are more likely to solve problems in both settings. Second, that teams consisting of types that master diverse tools have an indirect strategic advantage because tool diversity facilitates coordination. Third, that strategic tool choice creates counterintuitive optimal hiring practices. For example, optimal teams may exclude the highest ability types and can include dominated types. In addition, optimal groups need not increase setwise. Our framework extends to cover teamwork on decomposable problems, to cases where individuals apply multiple tools, and to teams facing a flow or set of problems.",Crossref,80.0,10.1111/jems.12295,https://doi.org/10.1111/jems.12295,2018.0,Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy,ok,CR-title:Optimal Team Composition for Tool Based Problem Solving,Optimal team composition for tool‐based problem solving,10.1111/jems.12295,,Goal 15,0.007885710431367411,False,

62e0b5f3c373d3086983ab60dfc3a130017ad218,Uday Rajan,Signaling Quality via Long Lines and Uninformative Prices,"Problem definition: We study the following puzzle: why do firms sometimes nurture long wait lines, rather than raising prices (to eliminate these lines)? Academic/practical relevance: In economic theory, prices are studied as a signal of quality, in absence of congestion (wait lines). We study price signaling when customers not only infer quality information from the price, but also from wait lines. Methodology: We developed a stylized model based on queuing and price signaling theory. The firm, privately informed about its quality (high or low), first determines its price. Next, customers arrive according to a Poisson process, observe the price and the wait line upon arrival, and decide whether to purchase. Results: When the proportion of informed consumers is low, to separate on price a high-quality firm must raise its price above the monopoly price. We show that there exist pooling equilibria in which firms instead charge a price lower than the monopoly price. We characterize two pooling equilibria. In both equilibria, a high-quality firm on average has a longer queue than a low-quality one, and long lines signal high quality. In the first one, the price is sufficiently low that short lines in turn signal low quality, so that the queue length almost perfectly reveals the type of the firm. In the second one, the price is in an intermediate range (but remains lower than the monopoly price), and short lines are an imperfect signal of quality. In each of the pooling equilibria, the high-quality firm earns a higher profit than in the separating equilibrium, despite the longer lines. Managerial implications: An empirical implication of our model is that, over time, when more customers become informed about the quality, the price of a new high-quality good should increase and the expected waiting lines should decrease. Our model integrates elements of price signaling in economics and equilibrium queueing in operations research. We hope that our research stimulates further interest in signaling games in service operations environments.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2018.0753,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2018.0753,2020.0,Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management,ok,CR-title:Signaling Quality via Long Lines and Uninformative Prices,Signaling Quality via Long Lines and Uninformative Prices,10.1287/msom.2018.0753,,Goal 17,0.0175807656140812,False,

Typically, individuals engage with a retail DIP offering in their particular contexts of interactions with apps or similar components. By delving deeper into the nature of the individual interactions, hidden and untapped sources of value can be revealed. Shoppers get more engaged, and retail managers gain more insights and can design ecosystems that allow a more effective creation of “all-win more” outcomes in more profitable ways. To be successful, retailers need to incorporate a broader view of value creation into their operations.

Opens a new window","Abstract When a romantic relationship becomes serious, partners often confront a foundational decision about how to organize their personal finances: pool money together or keep things separate? In a six-wave longitudinal experiment, we investigated whether randomly assigning engaged or newlywed couples to merge their money in a joint bank account increases relationship quality over time. Whereas couples assigned to keep their money in separate accounts or to a no-intervention condition exhibited the normative decline in relationship quality across the first 2 years of marriage, couples assigned to merge money in a joint account sustained strong relationship quality throughout. The effect of bank account structure on relationship quality is multiply determined. We examine—and find support for—three potential mechanisms using both experimental and correlational methods: merging finances (1) improves how partners feel about how they handle money, (2) promotes financial goal alignment, and (3) sustains communal norm adherence (e.g., responding to each other’s needs without expectations of reciprocity). While prior research has documented a correlation between financial interdependence and relationship quality, our research offers the first experimental evidence that increasing financial interdependence helps newlyweds preserve stronger relationship quality throughout the newlywed period and potentially beyond.",Crossref,100.0,10.1093/jcr/ucad020,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucad020,2023.0,Journal of Consumer Research,ok,CR-title:Common Cents: Bank Account Structure and Couples’ Relationship Dynamics Opens a ,Common Cents: Bank Account Structure and Couples’ Relationship Dynamics,10.1093/jcr/ucad020,,Goal 17,0.01600624573548252,False,financial commitments

Intuitively, one might expect the partner with greater financial knowledge to have greater influence. However, unless partners are routinely quizzing each other, they are unlikely to have a precise understanding of each other’s objective financial knowledge (OFK). We document that partner A’s understanding of partner B’s OFK is colored by partner B’s self-perceived OFK (subjective financial knowledge [SFK]). Accordingly, SFK plays an important role in financial decisions that romantic partners jointly navigate. In a survey and an incentive-compatible lab experiment (both with couples), we find that partners’ SFK differences reliably predict their relative influence over shared financial decisions. Partners’ OFK differences generally played a more modest role in those shared decisions. However, when romantic partners individually make financial decisions, OFK plays a more prominent role.

Opens a new window","Abstract Adults differ in the extent to which they find spending money to be distressing; “tightwads” find spending money painful, and “spendthrifts” do not find spending painful enough. This affective dimension has been reliably measured in adults and predicts a variety of important financial behaviors and outcomes (e.g., saving behavior and credit scores). Although children's financial behavior has also received attention, feelings about spending have not been studied in children, as they have in adults. We measured the spendthrift–tightwad (ST–TW) construct in children for the first time, with a sample of 5‐ to 10‐year‐old children ( N = 225). Children across the entire age range were able to reliably report on their affective responses to spending and saving, and children's ST–TW scores were related to parent reports of children's temperament and financial behavior. Further, children's ST–TW scores were predictive of whether they chose to save or spend money in the lab, even after controlling for age and how much they liked the offered items. Our novel findings—that children's feelings about spending and saving can be measured from an early age and relate to their behavior with money—are discussed with regard to theoretical and practical implications.

We propose observing opportunities in market exchanges and characterizing their profitability potential based on a component that is common to all observers and one that is specific to individual observers who vary in access to market information. Analysis of an online platform for freelance labor demonstrates our contributions in theory, measurement, and inference. In this context, discovery and exploitation mechanisms shape individuals' entrepreneurial transitions from freelancer to founder. We discuss applications of our framework across settings, extensions to other types of entrepreneurship, and the viability of opportunity as an orienting construct for entrepreneurship research. Managerial Summary Entrepreneurial opportunities are present in all markets but there is no systematic way of observing or valuing such opportunities, much less predicting where and when they become the basis for new businesses. We propose doing this with data commonly collected and archived by online platforms. We acknowledge that new businesses are often founded if one is in the right place at the right time; if one can distinguish a great opportunity from a good (or bad) one; or if one is capable of making a market.

Analyzing career history data for over 1,300 National Football League coaches from 1985 to 2015, the authors find that white assistant coaches were promoted at higher rates than Black coaches—holding constant many factors including unit and individual performance—both before and after a league-wide intervention explicitly implemented to close the racial gap in leadership representation.

Departing from the retention imperative of strategic human capital management, we propose that certain employee departures can enhance a firm's competitiveness in the labor market.

Characterizing advancement based on subsequent employers and positions, we analyze data on U.S. law firm hiring and industry surveys of perceived firm status between 2004 and 2013. We find that increased rates of employee departures lead to increases in a firm's prestige when these departures are for promotions with high‐status competitors . Managerial summary : Firms often emphasize employee retention.

This in turns leads to efficient corporate governance in Islamic financial institutions, structured to fulfill the requirements and regulations of sharia. Purpose: The purpose of the research is to determine Islamic Banking’s perception on corporate governance. Method: This paper presents a descriptive analysis on cooperate governance of Islamic Backing. The study reviewed articles on corporate banking systems, the Islamic banking system, the underlying structures that exist in both systems, their rules and regulations, and the relationship between both systems of banking. Result: The study found that Islamic banking has well-structured corporate governance guided by different bodies, including a multi-layered organization comprising the Sharia Supervisory Board (SSB), board of directors, investors, and commissioners. The SSB sits at the top of the corporate governance ladder; it offers oversight of all the transactional operations and compliance of the Islamic banking system based on sharia law (rule and regulations) known as Super Authority. This has accelerated the growth of Islamic banks. Conclusion: Islamic banking runs a multi-layered corporate governance whose primary transactional operation is guided by Sharia principles. This sole technique has contributed to the extensive growth on its corporate governance.",Crossref,87.91208791208791,10.33425/2770-2928.1024,https://doi.org/10.33425/2770-2928.1024,2024.0,International Journal of Agriculture and Technology,ok,CR-title:Corporate Governance and Isomorphic Legitimacy in the Banking System: An Institu,Islamic Banking Perspective on Corporate Governance,10.33425/2770-2928.1024,,Goal 16,0.03213857643793099,False,

Although the number of women in the highest legislative offices increased, their numbers are still significantly lower than those of men. Fewer than 100 women hold office in both houses of Congress. Corporate America similarly reflects significantly low female leadership numbers. For example, ""fewer than 20% of finance industry directors and executives are women, and [there are] no women leading the 20 biggest U.S. banks and securities firms."" Women make up nearly half the workforce and hold 60% of bachelor degrees, yet they hold only 14% of senior executive positions at Fortune 500 companies and 40% of managerial positions overall. These figures have persisted unchanged since 2005. Subtle yet entrenched forms of gender discrimination have clearly stalled women's career progress, and more must be done to rectify these disparities. The differences in gender outcome may be a function of demand-side (work-related) and supply-side (worker-related) characteristics. These include personal characteristics, human and social capital, and developmental, interpersonal, and situational factors. Gender overlaps with multiple group memberships based on family status, race, religion, national origin, and disability. These group memberships also influence women's status and power dynamics in the family, the workplace, and in other communities. The interplay of these factors makes gender-based discrimination an interesting phenomenon to explore. Having dependents is an important family status variable in the larger scheme of social differentiators that account for sex differences in career-related outcomes. In this study, we are interested in whether men or women benefit more from having access to networks when they have dependents. Prior studies have shown that mentoring and networking are major components of professional development that lead to career advancement.

This means that experimenters may not be learning what they think they are learning from ad A/B tests. The authors document these “divergent delivery” patterns during an online experiment for the first time. They explain how algorithmic targeting, user heterogeneity, and data aggregation conspire to confound the magnitude, and even the sign, of ad A/B test results. Analytically, the authors extend the potential outcomes model of causal inference to treat random assignment of ads and user exposure to ads as separate experimental design elements. Managerially, the authors explain why platforms lack incentives to allow experimenters to untangle the effects of ad content from proprietary algorithmic selection of users when running A/B tests.

In practice, the choice between display and in-feed native advertising presents brand advertisers and online news publishers with conflicting objectives. Advertisers face a trade-off between ad clicks and brand recognition, whereas publishers need to strike a balance between ad clicks and the platform’s trustworthiness. For policy makers, concerns that native advertising confuses customers prompted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to issue guidelines for disclosing native ads. This research aims to understand how consumers respond to native ads versus display ads and to different styles of native ad disclosures, using randomized online and field experiments combining behavioral clickstream, eye movement, and survey response data.

The city government published the results of these tests, creating a valuable dataset that is key to understanding the causes and extent of the lead contamination event in Flint. This is the nation's largest dataset on lead in a municipal water system. In this paper, we predict the lead contamination for each household's water supply, and we study several related aspects of Flint's water troubles, many of which generalize well beyond this one city. For example, we show that elevated lead risks can be (weakly) predicted from observable home attributes. Then we explore the factors associated with elevated lead. These risk assessments were developed in part via a crowd sourced prediction challenge at the University of Michigan.

a03d13cfdef7d986d65ff6e865aef96415c254ce,Eric Schwartz,Customer Acquisition via Display Advertising Using Multi-Armed Bandit Experiments,"Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the well-known “learn-and-earn” trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods. The online advertiser’s MAB problem, however, contains particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel.

Panel analysis using rare corporate bribery and charity donations panel data from South Korea reveals that as political competition increases, corporate bribery decreases, whereas corporate contributions to politically connected charities increase. Subsequent panel analysis uncovers that amid increased political competition, firms that made larger bribes in the prior year contribute more to politically connected charities in the subsequent year, and that this form of rechanneling is more pronounced for smaller business groups. Implications are discussed.This study argues that the field of strategy needs to do more to analyze firms' illegal strategic behavior, both to gain a deeper understanding of business practices in the corporate world and to develop recommendations for policymakers on how to curb such behavior over time. Using comprehensive and rare firm‐level data on bribery of high‐level government officials and donations to politically connected charities from South Korea, this study analyzes how businesses rechannel their bribery of senior‐level politicians to contributions to politically connected charities as the country's level of political competition becomes stronger.

In this study, we propose a new theory, that in corporate lobbying within the nonmarket strategy context, the liability of foreignness is driven in no small part by a values-based ideological conflict stemming from the divide between democracy and autocracy. Private-sector firms from autocratic countries face costs of illegitimacy in Washington, D.C., and professional corporate lobbyists charge such firms a fee premium, in effect, to pay for legitimacy. We conduct an empirical study of the lobbying fees charged by professional corporate lobbyists in Washington, D.C., to their domestic and foreign firm clients, and the results strongly support the predictions of our theory. We also show that the liability of foreignness in this context endures for foreign firms from autocratic countries over the 15-year length of our sample period.

However, when foreign MNEs adopt practices that resemble those of their local counterparts, whether and why foreign MNEs still face a LOF is unclear. This study explores why foreign MNEs that implement a compensation practice used by local counterparts – collective bonuses – may not experience the same performance benefits. Our data consists of interviews and longitudinal survey data of the organizational practices of MNEs in France, a country where commitment to egalitarian resource distribution is culturally strong. We find that foreign MNEs, especially those from countries where egalitarian commitment is relatively low, benefit significantly less in terms of productivity when implementing collective bonuses than do their French counterparts. We show how even when foreign MNEs adopt local practices, they can subtly transfer the cultures of their home countries. In other words, they transfer informal, elusive norms (e.g., non‐egalitarian attitudes of top management) that can be problematic. Tension persists between the informal requirements to facilitate the practice in the host country and the MNE’s home‐country culture, a core part of their tacit knowledge. It is one of the first pieces to show that imitating local practices may not suffice to reduce LOF because cultural conflicts make such imitation ineffective.

Using two data sets from South Korea, we show that multinationals improve profitability and productivity by aggressively hiring an excluded group, women, in the local managerial labor market. We predict and find that foreign multinationals in South Korea are in a unique position to identify social schisms, implement practices designed to support and enhance the hiring and promotion of female managers, hire and promote members of the socially excluded group to positions of managerial leadership, and enjoy a net profitability benefit from doing so despite the real risk of backlash from some regulators, customers, suppliers, and employees from the socially dominant group in society. Many multinationals, even those whose home markets discriminate against women, appear to have recognized the strategic opportunity of what we call the outsider’s network advantage.

Prior theory is incomplete, however, and prior studies have lacked comprehensive and reliable data on firm‐level bribery decisions. We offer a new theoretical prediction and a novel data set on high‐level corruption in South Korea, where the accounting records of two presidents in the 1987–1992 era were exposed to after‐the‐fact legal and public scrutiny. We find that, controlling for a range of alternative explanations, the threat of falling high status—that is, the combination of longstanding high social status with current‐period mediocre economic performance relative to that of industry peers—is a statistically and economically meaningful predictor of increases in the amount of large‐scale corporate bribery. Managerial Summary : What leads companies to engage in large‐scale bribery of senior politicians? Our concept of “threat of falling high status” refers to a circumstance where companies that have historically enjoyed high status through their owner families’ elite marriage networks experience mediocre economic performance relative to their peers. We show that this threat of falling high status is a notable determinant of large‐scale corporate bribery of senior politicians, using court data on corporate bribery of two South Korean presidents during 1987–1992. The implication of our study is twofold. Companies can strengthen internal control systems to avoid any large‐scale illegal activities at a higher level.

Opens a new window","Firm growth and its underlying modes are rarely examined on their own, which impedes our understanding of their relative importance, correlations among them and their associations with competition and future performance. We address these using a comprehensive seven‐mode decomposition of employment growth in all US firms (2004–2013). We find that organic modes such as opening or closing plants contribute more than transactional modes such as acquisitions and selloffs, and that growth modes exhibit age‐size differences and are generally positively correlated within firms. Trade competition in manufacturing increased closures and decreased acquisitions but had no effect on new units. Transactional growth positively correlates with future survival, unlike organic growth. Together, our findings expand our understanding of firm growth as a composite of multiple growth modes.Managers have many ways to grow a firm, but studies typically emphasize transactional modes such as acquisitions and selloffs. Using data on all US firms over 2004–2013, we study seven growth modes in an integrated and comprehensive model. We find that organic modes contribute more to growth than transactional modes, that young, large firms grow less relative to old, large firms, that when firms grow (shrink), they tend to grow (shrink) using multiple modes simultaneously and that growth modes vary in their association with competition. Importantly, transactional growth positively correlates with future survival, unlike organic growth. Together, these findings not only suggest that growth modes vary in their contribution to firm growth but also that they may differently influence subsequent performance.",Semantic Scholar,79.43262411347519,10.1002/smj.3641,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0553114731b7c12e0abe4f0c5cf2687328bb2fdc,2024.0,Strategic Management Journal,ok,CR-title:How Do US Firms Grow?

Opens a new window","Abstract Research Summary Being able to sell a business not only allows a firm to exit an industry but is also a motivation for entrepreneurial entry. Therefore, factors that make acquisitions less desirable for potential acquirers could not only affect the rate of acquisitions, but also entry and exit. We test this in the context of judicial adoptions of product line exceptions, which increased acquirer exposure to potential accumulated liabilities. We find that after adoption, and relative to nonmanufacturing establishments, acquisitions of manufacturing establishments decrease, while exits through closure increase. Relative entry of manufacturing establishments declines. These effects are higher in industries where resalability of physical capital is lower and for smaller entrants. Interestingly, while the likelihood of acquisitions declines for older establishments, it increases for younger ones. Managerial Summary Making it harder to sell a business not only hinders business transfers but also affects business entry and exit. This is because entrepreneurs and businesses often exit by selling to other firms, not just through closures. Based on comprehensive data on US establishments, we provide evidence supporting this thesis. We find that after judicial adoption of a legal principle that holds acquirers accountable for the acquired firm's product line liabilities, the probability of manufacturing establishments (which are more likely to have such liabilities) being acquired decreases more than that of other establishments. Simultaneously, closures as a form of exit increase, and the relative entry of manufacturing establishments declines. These findings underscore the strategic importance of acquisition‐driven exits for businesses and entrepreneurs.",Crossref,100.0,10.1002/smj.3584,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3584,2024.0,Strategic Management Journal,ok,CR-title:Caveat emptor as an obstacle to business transfers: Effect of product line liabi,"Caveat emptor as an obstacle to business transfers: Effect of product line liability exceptions on acquisitions, entry, and exit",10.1002/smj.3584,,Goal 9,0.02835219236237099,False,employment in manufacturing

Using a difference‐in‐differences approach that exploits the staggered introduction of reforms, we find that prices for ‘Basic’ service declined systematically by about 5.5 to 6.8 per cent following the reforms, but we find no statistically significant effect on average price for the more popular ‘Expanded Basic’ service. We also find that the reforms led to increased actual entry in reformed states, by about 11.6% relative to non‐reformed states. Our analysis shows that the decline in price for ‘Basic’ service holds for markets that did not experience actual entry, consistent with limit pricing by incumbents. To control for potential state‐level shocks correlated with the reforms, we undertake a sample‐split test that finds larger declines in prices for both ‘Basic’ and ‘Expanded Basic’ services in local markets which faced a greater threat of entry (because they were close to a prominent second entrant). Our results are consistent with limit pricing models that predict incumbents respond to increased threat of entry, and suggest that the reforms facilitated entry and modestly benefited consumers in reformed states.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/joie.12152,https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12152,2017.0,The Journal of Industrial Economics,ok,CR-title:Barriers to Entry and Competitive Behavior: Evidence from Reforms of Cable Franc,Barriers to Entry and Competitive Behavior: Evidence from Reforms of Cable Franchising Regulations,10.1111/joie.12152,,Goal 1,0.0374025744817582,False,

Using a repeated cross‐sectional design, 1554 Soldiers completed surveys before (T1), during (T2), and after (T3) deployment. Perceptions of organizational affect were conceptualised along two theoretically grounded dimensions: ambiance (emotional tone) and vigour (motivational energy), and measured using a novel validated scale. Factor analyses identified four distinct perceptions: suffering (negative ambiance, low vigour), contentment (positive ambiance, low vigour), restlessness (negative ambiance, high vigour), and zeal (positive ambiance, high vigour). General linear models showed that perceptions of organizational affect at T2 and T3 were significantly associated with psychological distress, hedonic happiness, and eudaimonic thriving at those time points, controlling for pre‐deployment (T1) holistic mental health. Perceptions of suffering were linked to increased distress, perceptions of contentment to greater happiness, and perceptions of both zeal and restlessness to greater thriving. Perceptions of organizational affect accounted for 5%–15% of the variance in holistic mental health outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of both perceptions of organizational ambiance and vigour in shaping mental health and well‐being and suggest opportunities for targeted interventions in high‐stakes occupational environments like military deployments.",Crossref,100.0,10.1002/smi.70097,https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.70097,2025.0,Stress and Health,ok,CR-title:Perceptions of Organizational Affect and Holistic Mental Health in United States,Perceptions of Organizational Affect and Holistic Mental Health in United States Army Soldiers During and After Deployment,10.1002/smi.70097,,Goal 3,0.07118111245919262,True,mental well-being

Opens a new window","ABSTRACT Introduction Military personnel frequently experience stressful, morally challenging situations that can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The relationships between moral identity, transgressive acts, and symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms; PTSS) among U.S. Army Soldiers were assessed. Materials and Methods A convenience cohort of 1,547 soldiers completed a survey assessing moral identity and PTSS before deployment. A subset of 505 soldiers completed another survey assessing transgressive acts and PTSS during deployment. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to determine the underlying factor structure of the measures of moral identity and transgressive acts. Generalized linear modeling, robustness checks, and sensitivity analysis were used to evaluate the predictive relationships. Results Moral identity did not directly predict PTSS during deployment. However, self-attributed and betrayal-based transgressive acts were significant predictors. Specifically, self-attributed transgressive acts and PTSS were moderated by internalized moral identity; individuals with a higher internalized moral identity experienced more severe PTSS following self-attributed transgressive acts. These findings were consistent across various model checks, including covariate adjustments, data imputation, and the application of a data quality filter. Conclusions The study highlights the significant role of self-attributed moral transgressions during deployment in the development of PTSS among military service members—especially in those with a strong internalized moral identity. This finding suggests a “target of opportunity” for the development of intervention strategies that mitigate PTSS by addressing the moral dimensions of military service.",Crossref,83.33333333333333,10.1093/milmed/usae064,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usae064,2024.0,Military Medicine,ok,CR-title:Amplified PTSD symptoms from self-attributed moral transgressions are linked to ,Amplified PTSD Symptoms From Self-Attributed Moral Transgressions Are Linked to Internalized Moral Identity During Military Deployment,10.1093/milmed/usae064,,Goal 17,0.01324508568067056,False,

We also broaden the emotional culture domain by investigating an action-oriented positive emotional culture of optimism and a negative emotional culture of anger. During a high-stakes international military training exercise, 55 U.S. Army tank crews (N = 175) completed a pre-qualification performance event, a final qualification performance event, and surveys at baseline and after both events. The positive emotional culture of optimism predicted a pattern of resilient performance defined as a rebound from poor pre-qualification performance. Emotional cultures of joy and optimism also directly predicted final performance, but neither the emotional culture of companionate love, nor the emotional culture of anger was a significant predictor. Results demonstrate the distinct nature of each of these emotional culture variables, and show that these variables differ from group trait affectivity and cohesion. Teams with a strong emotional culture of optimism were better positioned to rebound in the face of poor performance, suggesting that organizations that promote an optimistic culture develop more resilient teams.

Additionally, research in military samples supports decreased SI in Soldiers who endorse that their leaders convey a sense of purpose and meaning in their shared mission. However, no work has investigated whether these leadership styles relate to a sense of felt purpose and perceived cohesion in Soldiers and thus the indirect effect of these leadership styles on SI. Active duty Army Soldiers (n = 1,160) completed self-report measures of purpose in life (PiL), perceived cohesion, ethical leadership, loneliness, and SI. Indirect effect analyses were conducted to determine how leadership behaviors indirectly relate to SI through PiL and perceived cohesion. Indirect effect analyses revealed that ethical leadership had an indirect effect on reduced SI through increased PiL. In the same parallel indirect effect analysis, ethical leadership was related to less SI through increased perceived cohesion and decreased loneliness sequentially. Enhanced leadership training that effectively increases Soldier purpose may be an important primary prevention tool to mitigate the effect of suicide risk factors.

Opens a new window","Background US military service members have characteristically poor sleep, even when ‘ in garrison ’ or at one’s home base. The physical sleeping environment, which is often poor in military-provided housing or barracks, may contribute to poor sleep quality in soldiers. The current study aimed to assess whether the sleeping environment in garrison is related to sleep quality, insomnia risk and military readiness. Methods Seventy-four US army special operations soldiers participated in a cross-sectional study. Soldiers were queried on their sleeping surface comfort and the frequency of being awakened at night by excess light, abnormal temperatures and noise. Subjective sleep quality and insomnia symptoms were also queried, via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Lastly, measures of soldier readiness, including morale, motivation, fatigue, mood and bodily pain, were assessed. Results Soldiers reporting temperature-related and light-related awakenings had poorer sleep quality higher fatigue and higher bodily pain than soldiers without those disturbances. Lower ratings of sleeping surface comfort were associated with poorer sleep quality and lower motivation, lower morale, higher fatigue and higher bodily pain.

Opens a new window","INTRODUCTION Sleep is a fundamental human need. Obtaining adequate sleep quantity and quality is necessary for physical, emotional and cognitive functioning, as well as positive healthrelated outcomes—all of which support US military personnel readiness and lethality. When sleep is compromised, often in the form of shortened sleep, awakenings or difficultly falling/staying asleep, there is an increased risk for sickness, injury and death. Additionally, the negative effects of sleep loss on performance are well known. Those who fail to get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep are more likely to have impaired higherorder executive functioning, including decreased cognitive flexibility, reaction time, working memory, rapid decisionmaking, selfregulation and complex problem solving. 3 Additionally, both shortened and fragmented sleep are strongly linked to daytime sleepiness, drowsy driving accidents, riskseeking behaviour and risk of injury. 5 These robust findings establish sleep loss as a significant risk factor for poor mental, physical and cognitive health, decreased performance, and compromised safety. 7",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),92.51700680272108,10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001731,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8af22ead4ef42c92144f6b0bbde757bebe59d7fd,2021.0,BMJ Military Health,ok,CR-title:Sleep tactics for multidomain operations in US Army military personnel: optimizi,Sleep tactics for multidomain operations in US Army military personnel: optimising sleep opportunities to support readiness and lethality,10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001731,,Goal 3,0.02901150164477963,False,

Opens a new window","Military medical research is critical for enhancing overall wellbeing and readiness of military service members. Recently, in the USA, military research budget allocation has shifted from basic research to more translational research and rapid development of fieldable products. To meet this shift in priorities, applied research in the operational context— rather than in a laboratory—will need to increase but be high quality as well. Although field research provides several distinct advantages over lab research (eg, higher external validity), field research also comes with unique challenges. For example, in instances of largescale data collection, which often entails testing many service members at a time, participant engagement can be low. A lack of participant engagement is not without consequence, as poor engagement may lead to a less representative (and thus, less accurate) snapshot of a military unit, thereby limiting the utility of the findings, and increasing the likelihood of having poorer data quality. Poor quality research—especially in the face of the Coronavirus Disease 19 pandemic—can be financially costly and potentially deadly, both in the USA and internationally. In 2015, the RAND Corporation published a report attempting to identify predictors of low survey response rate among US military service members. The report concluded ‘lack of interest or time’ and ‘poor attitudes towards sponsoring organisation’ were linked to lower participation rate. Anecdotally, throughout several research projects, our team at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research observed the presence of the same factors cited by RAND as well as additional situational factors—including day of week, time of day and place of testing—that seem to also predict research participant engagement (ie, consent rate, participant effort). To this end, we explored our previously collected data to determine whether anecdotal predictors of participation matched objective participation and effort rates. This Editorial is intended to share these preliminary findings so that other teams who conduct similar military field research can maximise research success and value. In 2017, our team administered roughly 2000 surveys to US Army soldiers in an Armored Brigade Combat Team to assess the unit’s culture, performance and health. Over the course of 5 days, approximately 30 groups of 50–500 soldiers were asked to voluntarily complete a~45 min survey. Unit leadership dictated when and where soldiers were tested. The following data represent how time and place of testing were related to participant consent rate and participant effort during testing. There were two outcome measures of interest. The first was consent rate (number of individuals who consented ‘yes’ for use of their data divided by the number of surveys administered for that testing group). The second was each group’s proportion of individuals putting effort into the survey (‘careful responders’). Careful responders were identified based on the ‘long string’ analysis method, which differentiates careful responders from careless responders based on consistency of responses. An example of a careful responder is a participant with varied responses on a 20item survey. An example of a noncareful responder is a participant who completes a 20item survey with the same response for each item. Long string analysis was conducted only in individuals who completed all survey items. There were several metrics used for prediction of participant engagement: day of the week (Monday through Friday), time of survey administration (06:00–08:00, 08:00–10:00, 10:00–12:00, 12:00–14:00, 14:00–16:00 hours), and whether the survey was administered in the unit’s area (eg, Company Operations Facility) versus a centralised, shared location, such as a classroom. χ2 tests were used to compare the proportion of careful responders to careless responders between predictors. Analysis of variance tests were used to compare and rates of consent between predictors. Results that reached the threshold of statistical significance are presented below. As shown in Figure 1, there was a relationship between day of the week and consent rate. The consent rate was relatively high and stable Monday through Thursday, but the consent rate dropped considerably on Friday. It is possible that participants had work duties to complete before the weekend, and they chose to complete those duties rather than completing the survey. This notion is consistent with findings from the RAND report, which stated participants felt they did not have time to complete the survey. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the proportion of careful responders in each testing group and the time of survey administration. The proportion of careful responders was highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of careful responding was also more variable",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),83.63636363636364,10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001673,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b175d33dc289cb3e0c4d2961040fa697eac5360,2020.0,BMJ Military Health,ok,CR-title:Maximizing military field research participant engagement: The “when” and “where,Maximising military field research participant engagement: the ‘when’ and ‘where’ may make a difference,10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001673,,Goal 17,0.01547891803050829,False,

Opens a new window","Abstract Background The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Operational Research Kit-Actigraphy (WORK-A) is a set of unique practice parameters and actigraphy-derived measures for the analysis of operational military sleep patterns. The WORK-A draws on best practices from the literature and comprises 15 additional descriptive variables. Here, we demonstrate the WORK-A with a sample of United States Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) cadets ( n = 286) during a month-long capstone pre-commissioning training exercise. Methods The sleep of ROTC cadets ( n = 286) was measured by Philips Actiwatch devices during the 31-day training exercise. The preliminary effectiveness of the WORK-A was tested by comparing differences in sleep measures collected by Actiwatches as calculated by Philips Actiware software against WORK-A-determined sleep measures and self-report sleep collected from a subset of ROTC cadets ( n = 140). Results Actiware sleep summary statistics were significantly different from WORK-A measures and self-report sleep (all P ≤ 0.001). Bedtimes and waketimes as determined by WORK-A major sleep intervals showed the best agreement with self-report bedtime (22:21 ± 1:30 vs. 22:13 ± 0:40, P = 0.21) and waketime (04:30 ± 2:17 vs. 04:31 ± 0:47, P = 0.68). Though still significantly different, the discrepancy was smaller between the WORK-A measure of time in bed (TIB) for major sleep intervals (352 ± 29 min) and self-report nightly sleep duration (337 ± 57 min, P = 0.006) than that between the WORK-A major TIB and Actiware TIB (177 ± 42, P ≤ 0.001). Conclusions Default actigraphy methods are not the most accurate methods for characterizing soldier sleep, but reliable methods for characterizing operational sleep patterns is a necessary first step in developing strategies to improve soldier readiness. The WORK-A addresses this knowledge gap by providing practice parameters and a robust variety of measures with which to profile sleep behavior in service members.",Crossref,94.15584415584415,10.1186/s40779-020-00255-7,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-020-00255-7,2020.0,Military Medical Research,ok,CR-title:Practice parameters for the use of actigraphy in the military operational contex,Practice parameters for the use of actigraphy in the military operational context: the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Operational Research Kit-Actigraphy (WORK-A),10.1186/s40779-020-00255-7,,Goal 8,0.01107932586794715,False,

What happens when these tendencies collide—do people punish or protect close others who behave immorally? Across 10 studies ( N = 2,847), we show that people consistently anticipate protecting close others who commit moral infractions, particularly highly severe acts of theft and sexual harassment. This tendency emerged regardless of gender, political orientation, moral foundations, and disgust sensitivity and was driven by concerns about self-interest, loyalty, and harm. We further find that people justify this tendency by planning to discipline close others on their own. We also identify a psychological mechanism that mitigates the tendency to protect close others who have committed severe (but not mild) moral infractions: self-distancing.

Opens a new window","Abstract Experimental sleep restriction and deprivation lead to risky decision-making. Further, in naturalistic settings, short sleep duration and poor sleep quality have been linked to real-world high-risk behaviors (HRB), such as reckless driving or substance use. Military populations, in general, tend to sleep less and have poorer sleep quality than nonmilitary populations due to a number of occupational, cultural, and psychosocial factors (e.g. continuous operations, stress, and trauma). Consequently, it is possible that insufficient sleep in this population is linked to HRB. To investigate this question, we combined data from four diverse United States Army samples and conducted a mega-analysis by aggregating raw, individual-level data (n = 2,296, age 24.7 ± 5.3). A negative binomial regression and a logistic regression were used to determine whether subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and duration [h]) predicted instances of military-specific HRB and the commission of any HRB (yes/no), respectively. Poor sleep quality slightly elevated the risk for committing HRBs (PSQI Exp(B): 1.12 and ISI Exp(B): 1.07), and longer duration reduced the risk for HRBs to a greater extent (Exp(B): 0.78), even when controlling for a number of relevant demographic factors. Longer sleep duration also predicted a decreased risk for commission of any HRB behaviors (Exp(B): 0.71). These findings demonstrate that sleep quality and duration (the latter factor, in particular) could be targets for reducing excessive HRB in military populations. These findings could therefore lead to unit-wide or military-wide policy changes regarding sleep and HRB.",Crossref,97.05882352941177,10.1093/sleep/zsaa221,https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa221,2020.0,Sleep,ok,CR-title:Sleep and high-risk behavior in military service members: a mega-analysis of fou,Sleep and high-risk behavior in military service members: a mega-analysis of four diverse U.S. Army units,10.1093/sleep/zsaa221,,Goal 1,0.01417652402721945,False,

Opens a new window","Background: U.S. Army Rangers must maintain a high level of physical fitness in order to be successful during training and deployment missions. The hormone testosterone increases muscle growth and strength, which leads to better physical fitness and performance. Therefore, maintaining high testosterone levels is of critical importance to this unit. However, many Ranger missions require sleep deprivation, which, in non-military populations, has been shown to decrease testosterone. The purpose of the study was to test the impact of sleep deprivation during military training on U.S. Army Ranger testosterone levels. Methods: In two studies surrounding Ranger training missions, salivary testosterone was measured within subjects during a rested condition and following sleep loss in male participants (Study 1 n = 76 males; Study 2 n = 44 males). Testosterone levels were compared using paired-sample t-tests. Additionally, given the diurnal secretion of testosterone, we compared testosterone levels assessed after sleep deprivation to historical data measured at the same time of day in participants who were well-rested. Results: In Study 1, testosterone significantly decreased from 105.91 ± 35.35 to 79.87 ± 35.65 pg/mL (a 28% reduction) after sleep deprivation (t (75) = 5.85, p = 0.001). Similarly, in Study 2, following sleep deprivation, testosterone significantly decreased from 115.31 ± 28.44 to 89.29 ± 29.00 pg/mL (a 25.4% reduction; t (43) = 4.81, p = 0.001). In addition, Ranger testosterone was roughly 90% lower than historical data sampled at the same time of day. Conclusion: These data add to the growing body of literature showing that loss of sleep decreases testosterone, which may ultimately have a negative impact on physical training and performance in physically elite populations like the U.S. Army Rangers.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),83.01886792452831,10.23937/2469-5718/1510169,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1dc0bad629b096081c54987c85526c973d36e91c,2020.0,International Journal of Sports and Exercise Medicine,ok,CR-title:Sleep loss during military training reduces testosterone in U.S. Army Rangers: a,Sleep Loss during Military Training Reduces Testosterone in U.S. Army Rangers: A Two-Study Series,10.23937/2469-5718/1510169,,Goal 1,0.01669653339500018,False,

Opens a new window","Abstract Introduction Sleep loss is ubiquitous in military settings, and it can be deleterious to cognitive, physiological, and operational functioning. This is especially true in the military operational context (e.g., training, garrison, combat) where continuous operations prevent adequate time for rest and recuperation. Furthermore, even when servicemembers do have opportunities for sleep, environmental disruptors in the military operational context make it difficult to obtain restorative sleep. Such environmental disruptors are potentially preventable or reversible, yet there is little public awareness of how to minimize or eliminate these sleep disruptors. Therefore, the goal of this review was to outline prominent environmental sleep disruptors, describe how they occur in the military operational context, and also discuss feasible strategies to mitigate these disruptors. Materials and Methods We discuss four factors – light, noise, temperature, and air pollution – that have previously been identified as prominent sleep disruptors in non-military settings. Additionally, we extracted publicly-available yearly temperature and pollution data, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and the Environmental Protection Agency, respectively, for major prominent military installations in the continental US in order to identify the sites at which servicemembers are at the greatest risk for environmental sleep disruptions. Results Based on previous literature, we concluded light and noise are the most easily mitigatable sleep-disrupting environmental factors. Air pollution and temperature, on the other hand, are more difficult to mitigate. We also propose that harsh/uncomfortable sleeping surface is a fifth critical, previously unexplored sleep disruptor in the military operational context. Furthermore, we identified several problematic military sites for air pollution for temperature. Specifically, each branch has major installations located in regions with extreme heat (especially the Army), and each branch has at least one major installation in a high air pollution region. These findings show that even when in training or garrison in the US, military servicemembers are at risk for having sleep disruption due to environmental factors. Conclusions Environmental disruptors, such as light, noise, temperature, and air pollution, can negatively impact sleep in the military operational context. Simple, feasible steps can be taken to reduce sleep disruptions that are caused by light and noise. Yet there is a need for research and development on tools to mitigate air pollution, extreme temperatures, and inhospitable sleeping surfaces. Leadership at the discussed military bases and training facilities should focus on improving the sleep environment for individuals under their command. Such interventions could ultimately improve warfighter health, wellness, and operational performance, leading to greater warfighter readiness and lethality.",Crossref,82.4074074074074,10.1093/milmed/usz029,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usz029,2019.0,Military Medicine,ok,CR-title:A review of environmental barriers to obtaining adequate sleep in the military o,A Review of Environmental Barriers to Obtaining Adequate Sleep in the Military Operational Context,10.1093/milmed/usz029,,Goal 12,0.04821052679425372,False,

Integrating the notion of workday design with event system theory, we examine two prominent types of work activities for knowledge workers-meetings and individual work-to investigate how time allocation and pressure complementarity between them influence workday energy. We conducted two experience sampling studies, one with 245 knowledge workers from diverse organizations and the other with 167 employees from two technology companies. We found a time allocation effect, such that for a given period of the workday (i.e., the morning or the afternoon), the greater the proportion of time a knowledge worker spent in meetings relative to individual work, the less this person engaged in microbreak activities for replenishment during that period. The reduction in microbreak activities, in turn, harmed energy. We also found a pressure complementarity effect in the morning (though not in the afternoon), such that when a meeting involved low pressure in the presence of high-pressure individual work or vice versa, when a meeting involved high pressure in the presence of low-pressure individual work, such complementarity benefited energy. Overall, this research advances our understanding of how everyday work activities relate to knowledge workers' energy and sheds new light on the issue of work and workday designs.

The SEMT is inherently multilevel, yet there are two unarticulated but critical multilevel issues in existing scholarship: a paucity of research reflecting these multilevel features of the SEMT and an incipient multilevel conceptualization of thriving that has little theoretical justification. As a catalyst for progress, we present an integrative review drawing from the SEMT and other supplementary theoretical perspectives to define a multilevel conceptualization of thriving at work. Through this lens, we organize, synthesize, and evaluate the body of evidence, integrating the multilevel view of thriving within established scholarship. To substantiate our framework theoretically, we articulate how lower level processes unfold to develop higher level collective manifestations of thriving at work. We identify opportunities for theoretical and empirical advancement, coupled with specific, actionable recommendations, to deepen a multilevel conceptualization of thriving.

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively.

a7afe070c4fc013da84e5a615db08f7efbcc1862,S Sriram,The Effect of Information Disclosure on Industry Payments to Physicians,"In 2019, U.S. pharmaceutical companies paid $3.6 billion to physicians in the form of gifts to promote their drugs. To curb inappropriate financial relationships between health care providers and firms, several state laws require firms to publicly declare the payments they make to physicians. In 2013, this disclosure law was rolled out to all 50 states. The authors investigate the causal impact of this increased transparency on subsequent payments between firms and physicians. While firms and physicians were informed of the disclosure regulation at data collection, complete transparency did not occur until the data were published online. The authors estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of the online data disclosure exploiting the phased rollout of the disclosure laws across states, facilitated by recent advances in machine learning methods. Using a 29-month national panel covering $100 million in payments between 16 antidiabetic brands and 50,000 physicians, the authors find that the monthly payments changed insignificantly, on average, due to disclosure. However, the average null effect masks some unintended consequences of disclosure, wherein payments may have increased for more expensive drugs and among physicians who prescribed more heavily.

While the premise behind paywalls is that the subscription revenue can be a new source of income, the externalities that might arise from this pricing change are unclear. The authors study two potential externalities of newspaper paywalls: (1) the effect of a paywall on the engagement of its online reader base and (2) the spillover effect on the print version of the newspaper. The engagement effect considers how the paywall altered the various engagement metrics among light and heavy readers of online news. The spillover effect is likely to arise if readers view print and online versions of a newspaper as substitutes, implying that increasing the price of the latter is likely to increase the demand for the former. Moreover, many newspaper paywalls offer bundles wherein print subscribers are provided free access to the online newspaper. Therefore, the value that a reader derives from the print subscription could be higher after the erection of the paywall. As a result, paywalls are likely to have a positive spillover effect on print subscription and, consequently, circulation.

We posit that managers of matrix firms’ greater familiarity with coordination, knowledge sharing, and conflict management challenges in intraorganizational collaboration gives them greater confidence in their ability to manage similar challenges in complex alliances.

We combine empirical analyses of existing interorganizational networks in six industries with an agent-based simulation model of network emergence. Using data on technology partnerships from 1983 to 1999 between firms in the automotive, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, microelectronics, new materials, and telecommunications industries, we find that differences in technological dynamism across industries and the concomitant demands for value creation engender variations in firms’ collaborative behaviors. On average, firms in technologically dynamic industries pursue more-open ego networks, which fosters access to new and diverse resources that help sustain continuous innovation. In contrast, firms in technologically stable industries on average pursue more-closed ego networks, which fosters reliable collaboration and helps preserve existing resources. We show that because of the observed cross-industry differences in firms’ collaborative behaviors, the emergent industry-wide networks take on distinct structural forms.

Opens a new window","A recent wave of expressive accounts of corporate criminal law operate on the promise that corporate punishment can express a unique form of condemnation not capturable through civil enforcement. Unfortunately, the realities of corporate sentencing have thus far failed to make good on this expressive promise. Viewed in light of existing conventions that imbue meaning into our practices of punishment, corporate sentences rarely impose hard treatment in a manner or degree that these conventions seem to require. Accordingly, standard corporate sanctions turn out to be ill-suited to deliver—and, often, will likely undermine—the stigmatic punch upon which expressive defenses of corporate criminal law depend. A common response to this conventional problem with corporate sentencing has been to propose more, and harsher, corporate punishments. However, this approach overlooks the extent to which corporate punishment derives its stigmatic force from preexisting norms and conventions concerning individual punishment. If trying to improve corporate punishment, then, expressivists might instead seek either to leverage or to dismantle the underlying conventions that give existing sanctions meaning. An example of the former strategy would be to revitalize long-neglected proposals for corporate shaming by adopting a criminal convention currently absent from the corporate space—namely, the pervasive, stigmatic application of epithets like “thief” or “felon.” An example of the latter would be to join criminal justice reformers in targeting conventions that, in recent decades, have enabled increasingly draconian sentencing practices.

Thus, we define corporate purpose, at both the organizational and societal levels, as an institutionalized ideal, a historical, value-based aspiration guiding strategic decision making and practices. We interpret the current societal movement on corporate purpose as one rejecting the logic of shareholder capitalism and proposing sustainable capitalism in its place: an ideal for corporate purpose based on sustainable prosperity for society and its population. At the organizational level, corporate purpose can thus be articulated as a distinctive and meaningful intent to enhance the lives of people. We identify four strategic issues to consider in reconstituting a corporation’s purpose: corporate governance, strategic leadership, stakeholder engagement, and implementation.

To create value from an entrepreneurial orientation, firms need to possess necessary resources and capabilities, which new ventures often lack due to their liability of newness. We posit that legitimation helps overcome these constraints by enabling new ventures to acquire necessary resources and develop essential capabilities, and argue that entrepreneurial orientation and legitimation jointly enhance new venture performance. We analyzed data on 149 new ventures and found support for this argument. This study opens new research avenues by extending and incorporating explanations and predictions of entrepreneurial orientation and legitimation, two areas that largely have been considered as independent of each other. Managerial summary I n the absence of a clear connection between legitimacy and economic returns, entrepreneurs and managers may not give strategic priority to legitimation. We find that new ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation as demonstrated by innovative, proactive, and risk‐taking decisions and behaviors can achieve superior performance if they also actively undertake legitimation efforts to meet stakeholders’ cognitive, regulative, and normative expectations. This study suggests that neglecting legitimation as an important competitive tool may be a greater mistake than previously has been realized, especially for new ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation.

As political donations can reflect investors’ views and values, we theorize that the nature of investors’ political donations can shape managerial decision-making in important ways. We test this idea by examining changes in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, an area where managers have a high degree of discretion over how they account for investors’ views and values. Our theory introduces two focal constructs: political position, which captures the average political affiliation of actors within a group, and political dispersion, which captures the variance in political positions across group members. After hypothesizing a positive relationship between liberal-positioned investors and a firm's CSR activities, we argue that political dispersion among investors mitigates this positive effect. To account for between-group dispersion, we also suggest that liberal-positioned investors have a stronger positive effect on CSR in firms with more conservative managers.

Specifically, top management may decide on a strategic option before soliciting input under the program.

We argue that heightened intergroup anxiety related to male–female interactions leads incumbents to seize on social attributes that bolster category‐based trust in the reliability of prospective directors' interpersonal behavior. We predict that in response to #MeToo coverage, incumbents evaluate board candidates more positively when they share demographic characteristics or have prior social connections, and these effects are strengthened when incumbents socially identify with the firm. Empirical analyses using a longitudinal survey of evaluations of director candidates support these predictions. Our findings suggest how social movements can produce unintended consequences by inadvertently triggering psychological processes that partially offset the anticipated benefits of the movement. Managerial Summary Increased coverage of #MeToo has heightened concerns among board members about male–female interactions on the board. Our study finds that as #MeToo coverage increases, incumbent directors evaluate potential board candidates more positively to the extent that they share demographic characteristics, including gender, race, functional background, education and age, or when they are connected through the social network of board appointments. These effects are especially pronounced for incumbents who psychologically identify with the firm, meaning that their self‐concept is aligned with features of the organization.

We theorize that a combination of self-serving attribution biases among executives who gain status and egocentric biases of their prior benefactors cause a systematic difference in perceptions about the relative importance of that help to the beneficiary’s success. This leads to the perception among prior benefactors that the high-status executives have not adequately reciprocated their help. We then extend this argument to explain why perceptions of under-reciprocation are heightened when the high-status executive is a racial minority or a woman but reduced when the prior benefactor is a racial minority or a woman. The final element of our theoretical framework examines the social consequences of perceived under-reciprocation for corporate leaders. We suggest that the high-status leaders’ access to strategic help is reduced, and they may become the target of social undermining that can damage their broader reputation. The findings support our social psychological perspective on social exchange in corporate leadership, revealing how and why executives who have ascended to high-status positions not only may encounter difficulty obtaining assistance from fellow leaders but also may experience adverse reversals in their social exchange ties such that managers who previously aided them engage in socially harmful behavior toward them.",Crossref,80.95238095238095,10.1287/orsc.2020.1422,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.1422,2021.0,Organization Science,ok,"CR-title:From help to harm: Increases in status, perceived under-reciprocation, and the c","From Help to Harm: Increases in Status, Perceived Under-Reciprocation, and the Consequences for Access to Strategic Help and Social Undermining Among Female, Racial Minority, and White Male Top Managers",10.1287/orsc.2020.1422,,Goal 1,0.03774251483390478,False,

Our theory begins by explaining why an organization can improve its power position by acquiring partners that have direct advantages over it. We then propose the construct of indirect disadvantage to explain why an organization is motivated to acquire other partners that have advantages over its powerful partners. We further predict that the organization is motivated to acquire non‐partners to gain two‐step leverage over powerful partners. Finally, we theorize that the total indirect disadvantage of an organization relative to all partners negatively influences its performance. Using an extensive dataset on American businesses (1997–2007), we find strong support for our theory at both industry‐industry and firm‐industry levels. Managerial Summary Powerful buyers and suppliers are major influencers of the bottom line. This study develops a new theory to explain how to deal with them effectively, especially through mergers and acquisitions. In addition to considering powerful exchange partners as acquisition targets, firms can seek to exercise indirect influence over them through others. Acquiring other partners or non‐partners that have control over powerful buyers and suppliers is often feasible and effective in dealing with those organizations and improving the firm's financial position.

While firms face regulatory barriers to the use of board interlock ties as a strategy for reducing competition, we suggest that firms can circumvent these barriers by appointing the friends of competitors' chief executive officers (CEOs) to their boards. Our theoretical framework addresses the antecedents, maintenance, and performance consequences of such “board‐friendship ties” to rivals. Our theory explains (a) why firms form and maintain board‐friendship ties, where maintenance involves the reconstitution of broken ties and (b) how firms form and maintain these ties, by revealing the role of search firms in identifying the friends of rivals' CEOs. Empirical analyses of large‐sample, longitudinal survey and archival data provide substantial support for our theory. Managerial Summary Firms can and do reduce competition and increase performance by appointing the friends of competitors' CEOs to their boards, and search firms (headhunters) play a key role in forming and maintaining these “board‐friendship” ties to competitors. While board interlock ties between close competitors are illegal and direct friendship ties between CEOs of competitors are relatively rare, board‐friendship ties are common, and yet largely unknown to antitrust regulators and external stakeholders.",Crossref,97.65258215962442,10.1002/smj.2966,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2966,2018.0,Strategic Management Journal,ok,CR-title:Under the radar: How firms manage competitive uncertainty by appointing friends ,Under the radar: How firms manage competitive uncertainty by appointing friends of other chief executive officers to their boards,10.1002/smj.2966,,Goal 15,0.003879165735217138,False,

How ingratiation leads to resentment and social undermining of the CEO.,"Using survey data from CEOs and other top managers at large and mid-sized public companies in the U.S., as well as from journalists, we explore how ingratiation, a fundamental means of building and maintaining one’s social capital, may trigger behavior that damages the social capital of the person being ingratiated. Although ingratiation, such as flattery or opinion conformity, may elicit positive affect from its target, we suggest it can also elicit a specific form of negative affect toward the target, which in turn can trigger interpersonal harm-doing. Focusing on ingratiation by top managers toward the CEO, we find that ingratiating managers are likely to develop feelings of resentment toward the CEO and that ingratiation may be especially likely to elicit resentment among top managers when the CEO is a racial minority or a woman. We also find that negative affect from ingratiation can induce interpersonal behavior that has the potential to damage the social capital of the influence target, as feelings of resentment that result from ingratiatory behavior can trigger social undermining of the CEO in the manager’s communications with journalists.",Crossref,90.56603773584905,10.1177/0001839216686053,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839216686053,2017.0,Administrative Science Quarterly,ok,CR-title:Those closest wield the sharpest knife?

Although research suggests that CEO organizational identification can be quite consequential for the firm, little research attention has been paid to its determinants. To predict how the special context of the CEO position might lead to identification, we consider a set of motives that members have for identifying with their organizations and consider how unique features of the CEO position might be relevant to those motives.

Opens a new window","U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) allows banks to offset derivative assets against derivative liabilities with the same counterparty and report only the net amount on the balance sheet. Derivative offsetting under international financial reporting standards (IFRS) is much more restrictive, resulting in the single largest difference in balance sheet presentation between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Two important factors dominate the standard-setting discussion on this issue: (1) whether these derivatives are informative about bank risk and (2) whether disclosing them substitutes for recognition on the balance sheet. Using a hand-collected global sample of banks, we first show that offsetable derivatives are positively associated with bank risk, based on multiple risk measures, suggesting that these derivatives are informative about bank risk. Next, exploiting the differential accounting treatment across U.S. GAAP and IFRS banks, we find that disclosure versus recognition of offsetable derivatives matters for the risk assessment of equity investors but not for that of (more sophisticated) credit default swap investors. Additional tests corroborate the inference that investor sophistication helps explain the differential investor assessment of recognized versus disclosed offsetable derivatives. Collectively, our findings suggest that offsetable derivatives convey information about bank risk and that, for less sophisticated investors, disclosing them may not substitute for recognizing them.

We examine the period over which banking authorities discussed, adopted, and implemented Basel III to understand how firms respond to proposed regulation. We find evidence to suggest that affected banks not only lobbied rule-makers against it but also made strategic financial reporting changes and altered their business models in ways that reduced their exposure to the proposed rule prior to rule-makers finalizing the regulation. Further, our results indicate a sequential response, with banks responding through lobbying and strategic financial reporting prior to making business model changes. These findings highlight the interplay among firms’ financial reporting, business model, and political choices in response to proposed regulation and indicate that the appropriate date for an event study may be the regulation’s announcement date rather than its adoption or implementation dates.

While the prior literature examining reporting quality and capital structure has focused on observed capital structure, research suggests that financing frictions arising from adverse selection concerns can result in differences between observed and optimal capital structures. Using the deviation from a predicted model of optimal capital structure, we find that approximately a third of firms that have more leverage than their industry's median firm are in fact underlevered and more than 15% of firms that have less leverage than their industry's median firm are in fact overlevered.

Opens a new window","ABSTRACT We examine how personal lending relationships between lenders and managers are affected by information and accounting environments of borrowing firms. We address this question by exploring whether, following managerial turnover, lenders migrate with the manager from the firm where a relationship developed (origin firm) to the manager's new firm (destination firm). We find that the opacity of the external information environment of the destination firm significantly increases the probability of lenders' co-migration, while accounting irregularities at both the destination and origin firms decrease it. We also show that co-migration is affected by a lender's monitoring efficiency. A lender's monitoring efficiency increases its co-migration probability when a manager moves to an opaque firm, but not when she moves to a transparent one. When the destination or origin firm experiences accounting irregularities, even lenders with strong monitoring capabilities are mostly reluctant to continue their relationship with a migrating manager.",Crossref,100.0,10.2308/accr-52287,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-52287,2018.0,The Accounting Review,ok,CR-title:The Effect of Information Opacity and Accounting Irregularities on Personal Lend,The Effect of Information Opacity and Accounting Irregularities on Personal Lending Relationships: Evidence from Lender and Manager Co-Migration,10.2308/accr-52287,,Goal 10,0.03221681367229962,False,

Using a new text‐based measure of competition, and an instrumental variables analysis that exploits exogenous variation in bank deregulation, we provide robust evidence that greater competition increases both individual bank risk and a bank's contribution to system‐wide risk. Specifically, we find that higher competition is associated with lower underwriting standards, less timely loan loss recognition, and a shift toward noninterest revenue.

We hypothesize that DELR increases vulnerability to downside risk by creating expected loss overhangs that threaten future capital adequacy and by degrading bank transparency, which increases financing frictions and opportunities for risk‐shifting. We find that DELR is associated with higher correlations between bank‐level illiquidity and both aggregate banking sector illiquidity and market returns (i.e., higher liquidity risks) during recessions, suggesting that high DELR banks as a group may simultaneously face elevated financing frictions and enhanced opportunities for risk‐shifting behavior in crisis periods. With respect to downside risk, we find that during recessions DELR is associated with significantly higher risk of individual banks suffering severe drops in their equity values, where this association is magnified for banks with low capital levels. Consistent with increased systemic risk, we find that DELR is associated with significantly higher codependence between downside risk of individual banks and downside risk of the banking sector. We theorize that downside risk vulnerability at the individual bank level can translate into systemic risk by virtue of DELR creating a common source of risk vulnerability across high DELR banks simultaneously, which leads to risk codependence among banks and systemic effects from banks acting as part of a herd.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12079,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12079,2015.0,Journal of Accounting Research,ok,CR-title:Delayed Expected Loss Recognition and the Risk Profile of Banks,Delayed Expected Loss Recognition and the Risk Profile of Banks,10.1111/1475-679x.12079,,Goal 3,0.01298780216808912,False,

In the midst of this growth, the stigma concept has been criticized as being too vaguely defined and individually focused. In response to these criticisms, we define stigma as the co-occurrence of its components–labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination–and further indicate that for stigmatization to occur, power must be exercised. The stigma concept we construct has implications for understanding several core issues in stigma research, ranging from the definition of the concept to the reasons stigma sometimes represents a very persistent predicament in the lives of persons affected by it. Finally, because there are so many stigmatized circumstances and because stigmatizing processes can affect multiple domains of people's lives, stigmatization probably has a dramatic bearing on the distribution of life chances in such areas as earnings, housing, criminal involvement, health, and life itself. It follows that social scientists who are interested in understanding the distribution of such life chances should also be interested in stigma.",Crossref,100.0,10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363,2001.0,Annual Review of Sociology,ok,CR-title:“The Stigma Turbine: A Theoretical Framework for Conceptualizing and Contextuali,Conceptualizing Stigma,10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363,,Goal 1,0.02499869314267914,False,
58c4a09c59adea77ef8737ddf773bbb289e59b6e,Andrew Wu,Text-Based Measure of Supply Chain Risk Exposure,"Using textual analysis techniques, including seeded word embedding and bag-of-words-based content analysis, I develop a firm-level measure of supply chain risk exposure from a novel source of unstructured data—the discussion between managers and equity analysts on supply chain-related topics during firms’ quarterly earnings conference calls. I validate the measure by showing that (1) the measure exhibits intuitive variations over time and across firms, successfully capturing both routine and systematic supply chain risk events; and (2) the measure is about risk exposure, as it significantly correlates with realized and options-implied stock return volatility, even after controlling for well-known aggregate risk measures. I then demonstrate that the measure is specifically indicative of the supply chain component of risk exposure. (3) Consistent with theoretical predictions, firms facing higher supply chain risks have higher inventory buffers, particularly in raw materials and intermediate inputs, increased cash holdings in lieu of investments, and significantly lower trade credit received from suppliers. Moreover, (4) during unexpected risk episodes, such as the Tohoku earthquake, firms with higher ex ante risk exposure have worse operating and financial performance. These results indicate that the text-based measure provides a credible quantification of firm-level exposure to supply chain risks and can thus be reliably utilized as outcome or explanatory variables in empirical supply chain research.

9f4c507deefe7f5d618a61299ed374c5e224f2f5,Andrew Wu,Can Global Sourcing Strategy Predict Stock Returns?,"Problem definition: Whereas firms are increasingly relying on sourcing globally as a key constituent of their supply chain strategy, there is no empirical evidence on whether investors of these firms adequately reflect firms’ global sourcing strategy (GSS) in their stock-valuation process. In this paper, we empirically test whether stock market participants are efficient in doing so. Methodology/results: Using the empirical asset-pricing framework, we find that information concerning firms’ GSS strongly predicts their future stock returns. We compile a transaction-level imports database for U.S.-listed firms and construct measures for five widely studied GSS aspects in the operations management literature: the extent of global sourcing, supplier relationship strength, supplier concentration, sourcing lead time, and sourcing countries’ logistical efficiency. For each measure, we examine returns of a zero-cost investment strategy of buying from the highest and selling from the lowest quintile of that measure. Collectively, these investment strategies yield an average annual four-factor alpha of 6%–9.6% (6%–13.9%) with value (equal)-weighted portfolios. Their return predictability is incremental over other operations- and cost arbitrage–motivated predictors, such as inventory turnover, cash conversion cycle, and gross profitability; is persistent across different supply chain positions; and is robust to alternate risk models, subsamples, and empirical specifications. Together, our results indicate that the GSS measures embody independent information about firms’ future profitability, and this information is mispriced by market participants, leading to predictable returns. In accordance with this mechanism, we find that the GSS measures strongly predict both firms’ future earnings and the surprise in market reactions around the earnings announcement days. Managerial implications: The robust return predictability of our GSS measures suggests that investors are not fully incorporating GSS-related information in their stock valuation frameworks. Therefore, our results call for greater investor education on global sourcing and better dissemination of global-sourcing information so as to mitigate valuation inefficiency.

However, inclusivity does not necessarily translate into equal treatment on the platform. We investigate whether female and male learners benefit equally from forum discussions—typically the only form of interaction available—in online learning platforms. Methodology/results: Utilizing a large-scale, interaction-level data set on 174 courses on Coursera, we uncover an economically sizable and statistically significant disparity between male and female learners in receiving responses to their posts in MOOC discussion forums. On average, female learners’ questions are 3.11 percentage points less likely to receive responses from teaching staff than male learners’ questions, which equals 15.2% of the female group average. We also find significant gender disparity in staff response quality and sentiments. We investigate possible mechanisms behind the gender disparity using new techniques, including textual analysis tools. We show that the disparity is not because of content differences in male and female learners’ posts, nor is it attributable to their linguistic styles or the reputation of the posters. Instead, our results are most consistent with a male-driven gender homophily mechanism; although female staff members are gender neutral in their interactions with learners, male staff members systemically prefer responding to posts from male learners. We additionally show that receiving staff response leads to significant improvement in course passing rates, particularly for female learners. Therefore, the unequal access to information through course forums unfavorably hinders female learners’ performance. Managerial implications: Our results provide operational and organizational suggestions to platforms and content providers, including degendering user identifiers, implementing a content-focused post recommendation system, incorporating a gender-neutral user reputation system, promoting the recruiting of female teaching staff, and providing staff training that highlights the importance of gender-neutral interactions.

Some argue new education technologies (EdTech) can help transform schools for the better. Yet, as large-scale policy reforms have had only limited success, it seems unlikely that small changes from EdTech could have any measurable impact. In this paper, we study DonorsChoose, a nonprofit that operates a teacher crowdfunding platform. We ask whether DonorsChoose improves educational outcomes, specifically at low-income schools. Combining DonorsChoose data with data on student test scores in Pennsylvania from 2012–2013 to 2017–2018, we find that an increase in the number of DonorsChoose projects funded at a school leads to higher student performance, after controlling for selection biases. For a school with zero funded projects, one funded project—of about $400 in value—translates to between two to nine more students scoring basic and above in all subjects in high school and science and language arts in primary and middle school. We find this effect is driven mostly by low-income schools, indicating funded projects help close the gap in educational outcomes between students at low- versus high-income schools. Based on a textual analysis of 20,000 statements from all funded teachers describing how project resources are used, we find two channels of improvement most effective in the lowest income schools. We demonstrate that, although DonorsChoose projects are small, they improve outcomes and reduce inequality because they come directly from frontline workers—teachers—who know most intimately the obstacles their students face and how to help.

Using portfolio regressions and event studies on multiple data sources, including analyst ratings, firm announcements, and realized incidents, we find that highly rated SRI stocks outperform lowly rated SRI stocks during good economic times, for example, periods with high market valuations or aggregate consumption, but underperform during bad times, such as recessions. This variation in abnormal returns of high-SR stocks vis-à-vis low SR stocks is consistent with a wealth-dependent investor preference for SR stocks that leads to an increased (decreased) demand for SRI during good (bad) times.",Crossref,100.0,10.1093/rfs/hhab072,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhab072,2021.0,The Review of Financial Studies,ok,CR-title:Socially Responsible Investing in Good and Bad Times,Socially Responsible Investing in Good and Bad Times,10.1093/rfs/hhab072,,Goal 12,0.01010773778191864,False,

We first document a baseline fact: a significant proportion of tier-2 suppliers are shared by tier-1 suppliers. We then construct two simple metrics to capture the degree of tier-2 sharing and disentangle its effect from tier-2 suppliers’ own risks. We show that the focal firms’ risk levels are significantly related to the proportion of shared tier-2 suppliers in their supply network, and the effect becomes monotonically stronger as their tier-2 suppliers become more highly shared. Finally, we uncover causal relationships behind these associations using a new source of exogenous, idiosyncratic risk events in an event study setting. We show that, as tier-2 suppliers are impacted by these events, focal firms experience negative abnormal returns, the magnitude of which is significantly larger when the impacted tier-2 suppliers are more heavily shared. Overall, our study uncovers the subtier network structure as an important risk source for the focal firm, with the degree of tier-2 sharing as the main moderator. Our results also provide the microfoundation for a common structure in idiosyncratic risks and suggest the importance of incorporating the effect of subtier supply network structure in the portfolio-optimization process.

e209485942772dc5bb146cd9bfefdd0262a09800,Andrew Wu,"Do Corporate Social Responsibility Engagements Lead to Real Environmental, Social and Governance Impact?","We construct an event-based outcome measure of firm-level environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact for public and private firms globally from 2007 to 2015 using data from RepRisk. Then we measure the societal impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagements using participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as a proxy. We demonstrate a robust and striking difference between public and private firms: whereas private firms significantly reduce their negative ESG incident levels after UNGC engagements, public firms fail to do so and are more likely to engage in decoupled CSR actions—actions with no subsequent real impact. We then conduct a series of in-depth analyses to examine possible economic mechanisms. Our results are most consistent with shareholder–stakeholder conflicts of interest being the main moderator of decoupling. The intensity of this conflict is further moderated by three factors: ownership type, proximity to final consumers on the value chain, and specific ESG incident types. Other possible mechanisms, such as selective entry into UNGC and heterogeneities in media exposure, country representation, and entry timing, do not survive our analysis. Our results suggest that existing CSR engagements and one-size-fits-all CSR policy mandates might not necessarily lead to better societal outcomes, and a multi-tiered policy targeting different ownership and industry types might be more efficient at maximizing ex post ESG benefits.

However, a separate question remains as to how corporate actors operate within the space of this economic logic. While prior literature on diversification has tended to highlight the fungibility of resources as a basis for their redeployment, we point to an additional consideration of the complementarity of resources that makes allocation within the firm attractive, what we term a “new best use.” Further, we point to a potential tension as the economic logic suggested by this property of complementarity, and more generally interdependence with the firm’s other resources and activities, may make assessing what constitutes what we term the “new best use” of a resource challenging. The latent fungibility of a resource may differ from the range of reliable assessment of relative value creation. The allocation of resources and capabilities across a firm of any scale or scope is generally guided by the organizational and task structure of the enterprise. Building on these arguments, we consider two classes of factors that might impact the realization of the latent opportunities of resource redeployment. One is the “pipes” of organizational structures and grouping of business units and allocation of decision rights of specific managers to those units, and the other is the “prisms” of the various metrics of performance and value creation that may make resource use across different domains of the business more or less comparable.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/stsc.2022.0105,https://doi.org/10.1287/stsc.2022.0105,2025.0,Strategy Science,ok,CR-title:Resource Redeployment and the Pursuit of the New Best Use: Economic Logic and Or,Resource Redeployment and the Pursuit of the New Best Use: Economic Logic and Organizational Challenges,10.1287/stsc.2022.0105,,Goal 8,0.03286627286148892,False,economic diversification

Synergies that complementor acquirers accrue can be entry‐deterring. We develop a two‐by‐two typology of acquisition synergies in a multisided platform based on the two sides of a platform market (user side or complementary‐technology side) and two sources of synergies (economies of scale or economies of scope). We then leverage over 279,000 app developers' entry decisions into product categories in Apple's iOS App Store, over 71 million customer reviews, and over 12,000 unique software development kits to construct measures of synergies. Our paper contributes to the platform literature by demonstrating the entry‐deterring effects of synergies that complementor acquirers can exploit. Managerial Summary We develop the following typology of four types of acquisition synergies by integrating the multisidedness feature of digital platforms with the mainstream strategy research: complementary‐technology‐side economies of scope, complementary‐technology‐side economies of scale, user‐side economies of scope, and user‐side economies of scale. We show that (1) acquisition synergies are entry‐deterring, (2) synergies derived from economies of scope have stronger effects than those derived from economies of scale, and (3) synergies derived from the technology side have stronger effects than those derived from the user side. We highlight the significant competitive and regulatory implications of our findings. For example, one standard‐deviation increase in technology‐side economies of scope is associated with 55 deterred entries in 1 month or a $2.80 million potential loss in annual revenue.

We explain this phenomenon through a theory about how attributes of firms' resource bundles impact their scale and specialization. We posit that highly scalable resource bundles entail significant opportunity costs of integration (vs. outsourcing), which simultaneously drive “hyperspecialization” and “hyperscaling” in digital firms. Using descriptive theory and a formal model, we develop several propositions that align with observed features of digital businesses. We offer a parsimonious modeling framework for resource‐based theorizing about highly scalable digital firms, shed light on the phenomenon of digital scaling, and provide insights into the far‐reaching ways that technology‐enabled resources are reshaping firms in the digital economy. Managerial Summary Why are leading firms in the digital economy simultaneously larger and more specialized than those in the industrial age? Our research explains this phenomenon as being driven by the scalability of digital resources—that is, their capacity to create more value at larger scales when used intensively in a focal activity. We clarify what digital scalability means, and highlight trade‐offs created by the opportunity costs of not employing scalable digital resources intensively. Digital firms should outsource complementary activities to avoid diverting resources away from their scalable core, and to enhance their ability to grow exponentially.

We explore the underlying mechanisms, and show that including a low‐quality creative imitation in the retail choice set increases satisfaction with and choice of the original, while a moderate‐quality creative imitation does the opposite. Moreover, creative imitation affects consumers' satisfaction with the original by influencing whether their experience with the original verifies their expectations. Our paper reveals creative imitation effects to help incumbent firms effectively address them. Managerial Summary When the incumbent is challenged by an entrant using creative imitation, consumers may react differently to the incumbent, and understanding consumers' reactions allows the incumbent to make better strategic decisions about how to address the challenge. Using lab and field experiments, we investigate creative imitations with two quality levels common in our empirical context, low quality and moderate quality, and examine how and why they differentially affect the originals. We find the presence of a low‐quality creative imitation actually increased choice of the original by enhancing consumers' satisfaction with it, while a moderate‐quality creative imitation reduced choice of the original by undermining satisfaction with it.

The time anxiety concept is newly presented to address some uncertain events that may happen meanwhile charging of EVs, affect their charging patterns, and prevent them from meeting their energy demands. The working principle of the concept relies on prioritizing the charging before the event occurrences, and thus changing the EV charging patterns. Based on this concept, four different EV customer behaviors are proposed and their influences are investigated. The EV charging problem is formulated as a generalized nash equilibrium (NE) game, in which each EV minimizes its charging cost given its charging requirements and the charging facility constraints. The solution is developed on the basis of receding horizon optimization and reached iteratively in a distributed manner.

We examine how interactions among a firm’s capabilities influence the extent and direction of firm adaptation under conditions of demand-side change. Our empirical context is the U.S. defense industry, within which we study firms receiving defense-related Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards around September 11, 2001, an event which constituted an exogenous demand-side shock in which technology-related preferences of customers were reshuffled. We find that under demand-side change, pre-existing customer relationships have a double-edged effect: they facilitate “extension-based” adaptation when interacted with technology capabilities experiencing a decline in customer preferences, and they hinder “novelty-based” adaptation when interacted with technology capabilities experiencing an increase in such preferences. We also find that both types of technological capabilities together facilitate adaptation along the extension and novelty paths.<br> <br>Managerial summary. Demand-side change, in which customer preferences for particular technologies are reshuffled, occurs in many industry settings. A deeper understanding of the factors shaping firm adaptation under this form of change can influence managers’ decisions to implement strategies to plan for and react to such change. Using a sample of firms receiving defense-related Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards around September 11, 2001, we show that the customer relationships a firm develops prior to demand-side change can have a double-edged effect on firm adaptation. Such relationships facilitate “extension-based” adaptation when combined with technology capabilities declining in customer preferences and hinder “novelty-based” adaptation when combined with technology capabilities increasing in customer preferences. In addition, the combination of the two technological capability types facilitates adaptation along both paths.<br>",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),98.33333333333333,10.2139/ssrn.3502116,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41bf7e2ff4c88f3a95d40a7401ab89d3c7e7e5d8,2019.0,Social Science Research Network,ok,CR-title:Capability Interactions and Adaptation on Demand-Side Change,Capability Interactions and Adaptation to Demand-Side Change,10.2139/ssrn.3502116,,Goal 9,0.03973616319766509,False,technological support

This shift provides a good opportunity to broaden and deepen our theoretical base of concepts and frameworks because emerging and mature regions differ significantly in their institutional regimes. Hence entrepreneurial resource mobilization in emerging regions could differ significantly because of theoretical differences in actors’ action logics and resource governance. The eight papers in this special issue provide new empirical evidence on antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurial resource mobilization efforts in emerging regions. Here, we briefly summarize the state of the field, introduce the articles by situating them in a novel theoretical framework on entrepreneurial resource mobilization, and finally using our framework, we suggest opportunities for future research on entrepreneurship in emerging regions. 
 
Managerial Summary: Entrepreneurship research has advanced mainly using empirical data from the developed economies of North America and Western Europe. Because emerging economies differ markedly in their institutional development from developed economies, this prior research is less likely to be useful to understand entrepreneurship in emerging regions - which are increasingly crucial components of the global economy. This special issue contains eight articles addressing different aspects of the entrepreneurial resource mobilization process using diverse research methods on empirical data drawn from a broad range of emerging economies. This introduction describes the state of the field prior to the special issue, introduces the special issue articles and identifies topics that still need further investigation.

We argue that incumbents may respond to the threat of entry by either attacking the entrant or trying to learn from it, and that entrants, in turn, may react by either reciprocating the incumbent’s advances or retreating from it. Putting these competitive choices together, we develop a framework of four distinct potential scenarios of Schumpeterian competition. In particular, we emphasize a scenario we term creative divergence, wherein incumbents try to learn from entrants and build on their technologies, but their investments to do so cause entrants to retreat, resulting in diminishing returns to learning investments by incumbents. Exploratory analyses of the U.S. cardiovascular medical device industry find patterns consistent with the creative divergence scenario, with incumbent knowledge investments helping them to learn from entrants, but these learning benefits being undermined as entrants move away from incumbents.

This shock entailed not only an increase in aggregate demand but, more importantly, a shift in the relative attractiveness of individual product areas, resulting in the need for firms to reshuffle their product portfolios in response to changing demand conditions. The exogenous nature of the shock allows us to empirically identify the effect of preshock interdependence structures on postshock adaptation outcomes. We find that the locus of coordination inside a firm can explain differential postshock adaptation performance: because interdependencies spanning organizational boundaries are more difficult to manage than those contained within such boundaries, coordination across product areas creates greater adaptation challenges compared with coordination within product areas. We further investigate the moderating effects of product complementarity and organizational grouping, finding results consistent with our hypothesized mechanisms. As one of the first studies to empirically link a firm’s locus of coordination with its adaptation performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of interdependence and organization design in dynamic environments.",Crossref,98.34254143646409,10.1287/orsc.2014.0929,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2014.0929,2015.0,Organization Science,ok,CR-title:Organizational Constraints to Adaptation: Intra-Firm Asymmetry in the Locus of C,Organizational Constraints to Adaptation: Intrafirm Asymmetry in the Locus of Coordination,10.1287/orsc.2014.0929,,Goal 13,0.01692161793786346,False,

However, a critical challenge that undermines the utility of digital interventions is the suboptimal engagement of participants, where participant engagement is defined as the investment of physical, cognitive, and affective energies in a focal stimulus or task. Research aiming to understand how to increase engagement with digital interventions has grown substantially in recent years. This article highlights several limitations of the existing evidence that restrict its scientific and practical utility and discusses opportunities for advancing the science of engagement with digital interventions. Synthesizing the current body of evidence, we call for conceptualizing digital interventions as a collection of stimuli (e.g., notifications, reminders) and tasks (e.g., open the mobile app, practice a relaxation technique) and considering engagement with digital interventions as a process rather than a state (i.e., momentary conditions/experiences) or trait (i.e., a relatively stable disposition).

People who carry the 7- or 2-repeat (7/2-R) allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) are more sensitive to environmental influences, including cultural influences. Therefore, if the difference in brain structure is due to cultural influences, it should be moderated by DRD4. We recruited 132 young adults (both European Americans and Asian-born East Asians). Voxel-based morphometry showed that gray matter (GM) volume of the medial prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex was significantly greater among European Americans than among East Asians. Moreover, the difference in GM volume was significantly more pronounced among carriers of the 7/2-R allele of DRD4 than among non-carriers. This pattern was robust in an alternative measure assessing cortical thickness. A further exploratory analysis showed that among East Asian carriers, the number of years spent in the U.S. predicted increased GM volume in the orbitofrontal cortex.

And what is the impact of this tendency on consumption? This research investigates the malleability of older consumers’ feel-age and the underlying mechanisms by focusing on the influence of contextual social cues and the downstream effects on consumption behavior. Five studies provide evidence that the mere presence of young social cues triggers an identity threat for older consumers; and feeling younger is a way to protect the self from negative stereotypes associated with aging. By contrast, young consumers are relatively immune to age-related social cues. Whereas the presence of young social cues magnifies older consumers’ tendency to feel younger, this effect is attenuated when the young social cues are less desirable or when the older consumers possess higher self-esteem. The greater tendency to feel younger in the presence of young social cues increases older consumers’ choice of contemporary over traditional products, especially among those with lower self-esteem.

Crowdfunding represents a significant and growing platform for funding new and unique projects, causes, and products. To test whether neural activity could forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes weeks later, 30 human subjects (14 female) decided whether to fund proposed projects described on an Internet crowdfunding website while undergoing scanning with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although activity in both the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted individual choices to fund on a trial-to-trial basis in the neuroimaging sample, only NAcc activity generalized to forecast market funding outcomes weeks later on the Internet. Behavioral measures from the neuroimaging sample, however, did not forecast market funding outcomes. This pattern of associations was replicated in a second study. These findings demonstrate that a subset of the neural predictors of individual choice can generalize to forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes—even better than choice itself. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Forecasting aggregate behavior with individual neural data has proven elusive; even when successful, neural forecasts have not historically supplanted behavioral forecasts. In the current research, we find that neural responses can forecast market-level choice and outperform behavioral measures in a novel Internet crowdfunding context.

Using Chinese firms, we show that firms with more connected analysts have more accurate consensus forecasts and lower forecast dispersion. When a connected analyst departs and stops covering a firm, the accuracy and informativeness of the unconnected analysts' forecasts decrease, suggesting that information spills over from the connected analyst to analysts outside the network. We find a potential mechanism for this information spillover: communication through common institutional clients, which suggests that embedded financial analysts—those sharing close connections with firms and analysts—serve as a channel for disseminating proprietary, hard-to-verify information.

Using earnings conference calls with executives from 42 countries, we find that managers from ethnic groups that have a more individualistic culture use a more optimistic tone and exhibit greater self-reference. Managers' ethnic culture has a lasting effect and persists for executives whose work experience later exposes them to different ethnic cultures. The effect of ethnic heritage is observed in dialogues that reflect real-time interactions (i.e., Q&A ) and is less pronounced in the scripted, less spontaneous portion of the calls (i.e., management discussion). Analysts respond positively to optimistic tone, but only those who share the manager's ethnic background adjust their earnings forecasts for the cultural component of managerial tone.

We find that the restatement rate of U.S.-listed foreign firms is significantly lower than that of comparable U.S. firms and that the difference depends on the firm's home country characteristics. Foreign firms from countries with a weak rule of law are less likely to restate than are firms from strong rule of law countries. While the lower rate of restatements can represent an absence of errors, it can also indicate a lack of detection and disclosure of errors and irregularities. We infer the effect of detection and disclosure by associating the frequency of restatements with the quality of the firm's internal control system. We find that only U.S. firms and foreign firms from strong rule of law countries show a positive association between restatement frequency and internal control weaknesses. Firms from weak rule of law countries show no significant association. We interpret these findings as home country enforcement affecting firms' likelihood of detecting and reporting existing accounting misstatements. This suggests that for U.S.-listed foreign firms, less frequent restatements can be a signal of opportunistic reporting rather than a lack of accounting errors and irregularities.",Crossref,83.09859154929578,10.2308/accr-50887,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-50887,2014.0,The Accounting Review,ok,CR-title:Admitting Mistakes: Home Country Characteristics and Reliability of Restatement ,Admitting Mistakes: Home Country Effect on the Reliability of Restatement Reporting,10.2308/accr-50887,,Goal 16,0.02472779310209352,False,

Opens a new window","Existing studies suggest that platform access restriction may cause restricted complementors to switch to competing platforms, which will increase complement quantity on competing platforms. We re-examine this prediction by accounting for the impact of economies of scope on complementor responses to platform access restriction. We argue that restricting a complementor’s access on a platform may prevent it from achieving economies of scope from multi-homing, thereby incentivizing it to abandon both the restricted and (unrestricted) competing platforms. Using rideshare data in New York City, we compare the numbers of trips made by Lyft and Uber drivers, respectively, before and after Lyft restricted drivers’ access on its platform. We find that Lyft’s access restriction reduced trip numbers not only on Lyft but also on Uber. In addition, both Lyft’s and Uber’s trip numbers decreased not only during the restricted low-demand periods (e.g., non-rush hours) but also during the unrestricted high-demand periods (e.g., rush hours). In contrast, after a substantial number of multi-homing drivers left both platforms following Lyft’s access restriction, a subsequent access restriction by Uber led to an increase in trip numbers on Lyft. These results highlight the importance of accounting for interdependencies across complementor activities when designing platform governance policies.

Opens a new window","Abstract Research Summary This paper examines how incumbent firms' market positions and interdependencies across their submarkets influence their responses to entry threats. We adapt a model of capacity deterrence to show that because premium and low‐cost incumbents face different demand functions and operating costs, they experience different tradeoffs between ignoring, deterring, and accommodating threatened entry. In addition, the interdependencies within and between a premium incumbent's submarkets influence its responses. Using data on incumbent responses to entry threats from Southwest Airlines between 2003 and 2012, we find that (a) full‐service incumbents expanded capacity while low‐cost incumbents did not respond significantly, and (b) full‐service incumbents expanded capacity less aggressively in submarkets that had less substitutable customer segments and submarkets that were more complementary with their unthreatened submarkets. Managerial Summary An immutable market position is a core competitive advantage. Using data on incumbent responses to entry threats from Southwest Airlines between 2003 and 2012, we find that (a) full‐service (FSC) incumbents expanded capacity while low‐cost (LCC) incumbents did not respond significantly, and (b) FSCs expanded capacity less aggressively on routes that were expected to have a large number of business passengers and routes that connected to their international hubs.

Opens a new window","Abstract 
We examine the effect of firm ownership status on three environmentally relevant variables: energy efficiency, toxic emissions, and spending on pollution abatement. Prior research has demonstrated that public firms invest less than private firms and suggests this difference is due pressure from investors to strongly favor short over long-term earnings. We extend this logic to other firm behavior, examining whether publicly owned facilities invest in energy efficiency and pollution reduction differently than privately owned facilities. Using data from the US Census of Manufactures from 1980 to 2009, information on pollution from the Environmental Protection Agency Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and pollution abatement spending from the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures survey, we find that facilities switching to public ownership are less energy efficient and spend less on pollution abatement than their privately owned counterparts. However, we also find that facilities switching to public ownership have lower toxic emissions than other facilities. We also examine how different sources of external pressures alter these results and find that increased regulatory scrutiny is correlated with increased energy efficiency, toxic emissions, and abatement spending. More concentrated institutional ownership in public firms is associated with lower energy efficiency as is a greater brand focus. These latter results are broadly consistent with the idea that publicly owned firms respond to pressures from investors with a reduced focus on environmentally relevant variables. However, since facilities switching to public ownership have lower toxic emissions, this suggests that there are two competing pressures in publicly owned facilities: cost pressures, consistent with lowered energy efficiency, and public perceptions, consistent with lower toxic emissions, particularly since TRI data became available. In this sense, the combination of ownership and transparency of information appears to influence how firms prioritize different stakeholders.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),84.32432432432432,10.2139/ssrn.3125155,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e4b9532853a397089a27b589c3bd7487f924085,2018.0,Advances in Strategic Management,ok,"CR-title:Public vs. Private Firms: Energy efficiency, toxic emissions and abatement spend","Public vs. Private Firms: Energy Efficiency, Toxic Emissions and Abatement Spending",10.2139/ssrn.3125155,,Goal 7,0.1808888512671153,True,carbon emissions; energy-related emissions

Arbitraging across institutional contexts is an important function of MNCs, but it also creates coordination challenges. The choice of organization structure, such as the differential assignment of supervisory responsibilities, is an important tool for managing these coordination challenges. Using data on the business activities and supervision relationships within U.S. multinational manufacturers in 1996–2008, I find that frontline subsidiaries in countries with weaker institutions are more likely to be supervised by foreign rather than domestic supervisory units. Foreign supervision is even more likely when subsidiaries in weak-institution countries conduct activities that are more central to or interdependent with their parents’ global operations. These findings confirm that MNCs use differential supervision to enhance global coordination.

Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how these fields are structured and the implications of structural variation on how issues are addressed over time. We advance theory in this area by arguing that issue fields are characterized by varying settlement constellations that structure these fields. We develop a typology of three settlement constellations—unified, fragmented, and bifurcated—and describe their impact on field structure and the challenges they raise for addressing field-defining issues.

By overlooking caste, scholars risk conforming subaltern empirics to imperialist knowledge and miss the nuance and complexity that caste can bring to organization studies. We argue that the caste system is an institution that affects the workplace, yet it is difficult to dismantle because of its rooting in bodies and the sacred, which strips away agency. As an institution that is deeply embodied, caste has implications for institutional work, precarious work and modern slavery. We conclude with a call for scholarly engagement with caste to study its implications in the pursuit of grand challenges and inclusive organizations.",Crossref,93.54838709677419,10.1177/0170840620964038,https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840620964038,2020.0,Organization Studies,ok,CR-title:Caste and Organization Studies: Our silence makes us complicit,Caste and Organization Studies: Our Silence Makes Us Complicit,10.1177/0170840620964038,,Goal 8,0.02169479874612248,False,

While researchers have focused on whether incumbents can successfully adapt, we know little about how potentially disruptive innovation may be avoided. Studying clean technology in Canada, we examine incumbent resistance when potentially disruptive technologies are seen as socially beneficial. We identify actions taken by incumbents and other socio‐technical regime actors to respond to the issue while simultaneously enacting legitimate stabilizing mechanisms within the regime’s institutional infrastructure. Specifically, temporal and resource‐based actions led to temporal complexity for disruptive cleantech entrepreneurs, and evaluation structuring work led to latent control of the cleantech category, privileging incumbents and resulting in unobtrusive maintenance . Our findings contribute to the disruptive innovation and institutional theory literatures by showing how disruption may be stalled by the enactment of legitimate elements of the institutional infrastructure rather than direct institutional defence.",Crossref,92.17391304347827,10.1111/joms.12350,https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.12350,2018.0,Journal of Management Studies,ok,"CR-title:Unobtrusive maintenance: Temporal complexity, latent category control and the st","Unobtrusive Maintenance: Temporal Complexity, Latent Category Control and the Stalled Emergence of the Cleantech Sector",10.1111/joms.12350,,Goal 9,0.08208790443862692,True,clean technologies

Consistent with the theoretical premise that markets and value chains are social orders, we found that the NGO’s success relied on building the social structure of a market wherein market participants could negotiate relationships and norms of production and exchange and embed them in practices and technologies. To establish social structure among participants as a means of market building, the NGO acquired relevant knowledge, then used contextual bridging (transferring new meanings, practices and structures into a given context in a way that is sensitive to the norms, practices, knowledge and relationships that exist in that context), brokering relationships along the value chain (facilitating introductions and exchanges between value chain members) and funding experimentation (providing resources to test ideas and assumptions about new market practices). Market participants themselves also contributed to the development of the market’s social structure by means of social embedding (building relationships and negotiating norms of exchange and coordination), and material embedding (implementing technologies and practices and integrating market norms into technology). Increased productivity and equity and reduced costs of transactions resulted from the creation of a social structure that, in this case, preceded and enabled the economic structuring of a market rather than the other way around.",Crossref,92.6829268292683,10.1177/0170840615580011,https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615580011,2015.0,Organization Studies,ok,CR-title:Building the social structure of a market,Building the Social Structure of a Market,10.1177/0170840615580011,,Goal 9,0.05724476917541082,True,industrial value chains

These behavioral responses mitigated the mortality impact of air pollution. Conservative estimates indicate that the program’s health benefits outweigh the costs by an order of magnitude. The findings highlight the benefits of improving public access to pollution information in developing countries which often experience severe air pollution but lack pollution data collection and dissemination.

Opens a new window","Many human activities can be strategically timed around forecastable natural hazards to mute their impacts. We study air pollution shock mitigation in a high-stakes healthcare setting: hospital surgery scheduling. Using newly available inpatient surgery records from a major city in China, we track post-surgery survival for over 1 million patients, and document a significant increase of hospital mortality among those who underwent surgeries on days with high particulate matter pollution. This effect has two special features. First, pollution on the surgery day, rather than exposure prior to hospitalization, before or after the surgery, is primarily explanatory of the excess mortality. Second, a small but high-risk group – elderly patients undergoing respiratory or cancer operations – bears a majority of pollution’s damages. Based on these empirical findings, we build and analyze a model of hospital surgery scheduling. For over a third of the high-risk surgeries, there exists an alternative, lower-pollution day within three days such that moving the surgery may lead to a Pareto improvement in survival.

This effect is explained by short-term suppression of pollution on monitored days, especially during high-pollution periods when the city’s noncompliance risk is high.
