Despite this, no systematic reviews have been conducted examining the COVID©\19 and ED peer©\reviewed literature. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize the impact of the COVID©\19 pandemic on individuals with EDs. Method Database searches of the peer©\reviewed literature were completed in the subsequent databases: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO (from November 2019 to October 20, 2021). All research reporting on the relationship between the COVID©\19 pandemic on individuals with EDs were included. Results Fifty©\three studies met the inclusion criteria, including 36,485 individuals with EDs. The pooled hospital admissions across the studies demonstrated on average a 48% (pre = 591, post = 876, n =?10 studies) increase in admissions during the pandemic compared to previous pre©\pandemic timepoints. In this review, 36% of studies (n =?19) documented increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic, this increase in eating disorder symptoms were documented in AN, BED, BN, and OFSED patients. Studies also demonstrated increases in anxiety (n =?9) and depression (n =?8), however patterns of change appeared to be diagnostic and timing specific (e.g., lockdowns). Discussion We found a large increase in the number of hospitalizations and an increase in ED symptoms, anxiety, depression, and changes to BMI in ED patients during the pandemic. However, these changes appeared to be diagnostic and timing specific. Many qualitative studies described deterioration in ED symptomatology due to decreased access to care and treatment, changes to routine and loss of structure, negative influence of the media, and social isolation. Future studies are needed to focus on pediatric populations, new ED diagnoses, and severity of illness at presentation. Public Significance The scientific literature suggests that individuals with eating disorders have experienced deteriorating symptoms, increased isolation, and an increase in hospital admissions as a result of the COVID©\19 pandemic. This study synthesized 53 articles and explored the impact of the COVID©\19 pandemic on patients with eating disorders. We found increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic; this increase in eating disorder symptoms was documented in patients with common eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, binge©\eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and other specified feeding and eating disorders. This review also demonstrated changes in body mass index (an index used to classify underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults) and increases in anxiety and depression during the pandemic compared to previous timepoints; patterns of change appeared to be related to timing of lockdowns. This review provides important information on the impact of COVID©\19 on the physical and mental health of individuals with eating disorders.",Semantic Scholar,11.9047619,10.1002/eat.23704,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a348766886dd97df947bcd6082866ed2340497af,2022,International Journal of Eating Disorders,ok,"CR-biblio:DeVoe, S.

Tumor-treating fields, delivering low-intensity alternating electric fields, can also be given concurrently with adjuvant temozolomide. At recurrence, there is no standard of care; however, surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy with chemotherapy or bevacizumab are all potential options, depending on the patient's circumstances. Supportive and palliative care remain important considerations throughout the disease course in the multimodality approach to management. The recently revised classification of glioblastoma based on molecular profiling, notably isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, is a result of enhanced understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of disease.

CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration causes severe early-onset vision loss due to pathogenic variants in CEP290. EDIT-101 is a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene-editing complex designed to treat inherited retinal degeneration caused by a specific damaging variant in intron 26 of CEP290 (IVS26 variant).


METHODS
We performed a phase 1-2, open-label, single-ascending-dose study in which persons 3 years of age or older with CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration caused by a homozygous or compound heterozygous IVS26 variant received a subretinal injection of EDIT-101 in the worse (study) eye. The primary outcome was safety, which included adverse events and dose-limiting toxic effects. Key secondary efficacy outcomes were the change from baseline in the best corrected visual acuity, the retinal sensitivity detected with the use of full-field stimulus testing (FST), the score on the Ora-Visual Navigation Challenge mobility test, and the vision-related quality-of-life score on the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (in adults) or the Children's Visual Function Questionnaire (in children).


RESULTS
EDIT-101 was injected in 12 adults 17 to 63 years of age (median, 37 years) at a low dose (in 2 participants), an intermediate dose (in 5), or a high dose (in 5) and in 2 children 9 and 14 years of age at the intermediate dose. At baseline, the median best corrected visual acuity in the study eye was 2.4 log10 of the minimum angle of resolution (range, 3.9 to 0.6). No serious adverse events related to the treatment or procedure and no dose-limiting toxic effects were recorded. Six participants had a meaningful improvement from baseline in cone-mediated vision as assessed with the use of FST, of whom 5 had improvement in at least one other key secondary outcome. Nine participants (64%) had a meaningful improvement from baseline in the best corrected visual acuity, the sensitivity to red light as measured with FST, or the score on the mobility test. Six participants had a meaningful improvement from baseline in the vision-related quality-of-life score.


CONCLUSIONS
The safety profile and improvements in photoreceptor function after EDIT-101 treatment in this small phase 1-2 study support further research of in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to treat inherited retinal degenerations due to the IVS26 variant of CEP290 and other genetic causes.

Significant positive associations (effect sizes <0.05%) were observed between the extraversion polygenic score and wellbeing measures, and a negative association was observed between the polygenic neuroticism score and life satisfaction. Furthermore, using GWA data, genetic correlations of -0.49 and -0.55 were estimated between neuroticism with life satisfaction and positive affect, respectively. The moderate genetic correlation between neuroticism and wellbeing is in line with twin research showing that genetic influences on wellbeing are also shared with other independent personality domains.",Semantic Scholar,22.5,10.1017/thg.2016.65,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d28e47fa2a05bf35faa3f26567a7b52fd9093cc2,2016,Twin Research and Human Genetics,ok,"CR-biblio:Okbay 2016 Okbay, Aysu, Bart M",,10.1017/thg.2016.65,,Goal 15,0.008769926,FALSE,

When either $W_0 \not\equiv 0$ or $J_0 \not\equiv 0$, by normalization of certain two group parameters ${\sf c}$ and ${\sf e}$, an invariant coframe can be built on $M^5$, showing that the dimension of the CR automorphism group drops from $10$ to $5$.

The requester is the primary caregiver responsible for managing the health of a population of patients. When a patient requires advanced care outside of the requester¡¯s expertise, the requester refers the patient to a provider and pays for the referral services. Treatment may succeed or fail, and in the case of failure, the requester incurs further follow-up costs. The requester may exert preventive effort to reduce the volume of referrals. The provider may exert nonreimbursable effort to reduce the chance of treatment failure. We analyze payment contracts between the two firms.

Operations Research , 2021.",2021,"Francisco Castro, Omar Besbes and Ilan Lobel","We consider the pricing problem faced by a revenue-maximizing platform matching price-sensitive customers to flexible supply units within a geographic area. This can be interpreted as the problem faced in the short term by a ride-hailing platform. We propose a two-dimensional framework in which a platform selects prices for different locations and drivers respond by choosing where to relocate, in equilibrium, based on prices, travel costs, and driver congestion levels. The platform¡¯s problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem with equilibrium constraints. We elucidate structural properties of supply equilibria and the corresponding utilities that emerge and establish a form of spatial decomposition, which allows us to localize the analysis to regions of movement. In turn, uncovering an appropriate knapsack structure to the platform¡¯s problem, we establish a crisp local characterization of the optimal prices and the corresponding supply response. In the optimal solution, the platform applies different treatments to different locations. In some locations, prices are set so that supply and demand are perfectly matched; overcongestion is induced in other locations, and some less profitable locations are indirectly priced out. To obtain insights on the global structure of an optimal solution, we derive in quasi-closed form the optimal solution for a family of models characterized by a demand shock. The optimal solution, although better balancing supply and demand around the shock, quite interestingly also ends up inducing movement away from it.

From 1915 the family spent summers at a rented cottage in Gloucester, Massachusetts, a small city that would become central to Olson¡¯s later life and work. At Wesleyan University, Olson earned his BA in 1932 and his MA, with a thesis on Melville, in 1933. Between 1936 and 1939 Olson completed the coursework for a PhD in Harvard¡¯s new program in American civilization, but not the dissertation. In 1938 Olson published his first important essay, ¡°Lear and Moby Dick,¡± based on his discovery of Melville¡¯s annotated copies of Shakespeare. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1939 for a book on Melville, but his interests shifted toward politics, and between 1941 and 1945 he worked for the American Civil Liberties Union, the Common Council for American Unity, the Foreign Language Division of the Office of War Information, and the Democratic National Committee.

We determined the chemical and B isotope composition of tourmaline as well as S isotope ratios of anhydrite and sulfide minerals to shed light on the composition and origin of mineralizing fluids. Also, the utility of tourmaline as an indicator mineral was tested by comparing mineralized and barren breccias. Tourmaline in mineralized samples has a narrow Mg range (1.5¨C2 apfu) and variable, generally low Al contents (4¨C6.5 apfu). A strong negative correlation of Al with Fe indicates monovalent substitution of Al and Fe3+, implying relatively oxidizing fluids. In contrast, tourmaline from barren breccias has a narrower Al range (6¨C7 apfu), lower and more variable Mg (0.2¨C2.5 apfu), and a strong negative Mg-Fe correlation, suggesting more reduced fluids with a dominance of Fe2+. These features and the implications of redox contrast may have exploration significance. Tourmaline from all breccia samples yielded ¦Ä11B values from 1.8 to 7.9¡ë. A magmatic source of boron is concluded from the identical B isotope values of granite-hosted tourmaline in the district (1.2¨C7.7¡ë) and from the similar range of regional volcanic and porphyry rocks in the Central Andes. The ¦Ä34S values of coexisting anhydrite (11.6¨C14.5¡ë) and chalcopyrite (¨C1.5 to ¨C0.2¡ë) in mineralized breccia give S isotope exchange temperatures of 377¡ã to 437¡ãC, consistent with fluid inclusion temperatures. Total sulfur ¦Ä34Sfluid estimates between 1.4 ¡À 3.9 and 8.8 ¡À 1.3¡ë are broadly consistent with a magmatic source but not well constrained. However, published O and H isotope ratios of quartz and tourmaline from the R¨ªo Blanco-Los Bronces breccias have a clear magmatic signature, so this is the preferred scenario. Mass balance simulations of the boron budget show that typical magma flux rates, water contents, and boron concentration for the Central Andes can produce the estimated 107 tons of boron in the R¨ªo Blanco-Los Bronces breccias within the 4-m.y. duration of porphyry intrusions if (1) magma accumulated and evolved at midcrustal levels before emplacement and (2) boron partitioned strongly to the fluid phase (DBfluid/melt> 3).",Semantic Scholar,9.756097561,10.5382/econgeo.4991,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48b0fc8ba7244ce079124328c2a16431e9951a81,2023,Economic Geology,ok,"CR-biblio:Blanco, C.C., Caro, F., Corbett, C.J.

Here we show that neuromedin U (NMU) in mice is a fast and potent regulator of type 2 innate immunity in the context of a functional neuron¨CILC2 unit. We found that ILC2s selectively express neuromedin U receptor 1 (Nmur1), and mucosal neurons express NMU. Cell-autonomous activation of ILC2s with NMU resulted in immediate and strong NMUR1-dependent production of innate inflammatory and tissue repair cytokines. NMU controls ILC2s downstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and calcium-influx-dependent activation of both calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). NMU treatment in vivo resulted in immediate protective type 2 responses. Accordingly, ILC2-autonomous ablation of Nmur1 led to impaired type 2 responses and poor control of worm infection. Notably, mucosal neurons were found adjacent to ILC2s, and these neurons directly sensed worm products and alarmins to induce NMU and to control innate type 2 cytokines.

Members of the F subfamily of ABC ATPases (ABCFs) have been long hypothesised to promote translation of such problematic motifs. In this study we have applied genetics and reporter-based assays to characterise the four housekeeping ABCF ATPases of Bacillus subtilis: YdiF, YfmM, YfmR/Uup and YkpA/YbiT. We show that YfmR cooperates with the translation factor EF-P that promotes translation of Pro-rich motifs. Simultaneous loss of both YfmR and EF-P results in a dramatic growth defect. Surprisingly, this growth defect can be largely suppressed though overexpression of an EF-P variant lacking the otherwise crucial 5-amino-pentanolylated residue K32. Using in vivo reporter assays, we show that overexpression of YfmR can alleviate ribosomal stalling on Asp-Pro motifs. Finally, we demonstrate that YkpA/YbiT promotes translation of positively and negatively charged motifs but is inactive in resolving ribosomal stalls on proline-rich stretches.

State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy¡¯s action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the class of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases but that, computationally, even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances using real Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index data.

In this work, we propose the concept of virtual stake which measures the truthfulness of witness voting throughout the round.

The airlift planning problem faced by the air component of USTRANSCOM is to decide how requirements (passengers and cargo) will be assigned to the available aircraft fleet and the sequence of pickups and drop-offs that each aircraft will perform to ensure that the requirements are delivered with minimal delay and with maximum utilization of the available aircraft. This problem is of significant interest to USTRANSCOM because of the highly time-sensitive nature of the requirements that are typically designated for delivery by airlift, as well as the very high cost of airlift operations. At the same time, the airlift planning problem is extremely difficult to solve because of the combinatorial nature of the problem and the numerous constraints present in the problem (such as weight restrictions and crew rest requirements). In this paper, we propose an approach for solving the airlift planning problem faced by USTRANSCOM based on modern, large-scale optimization. Our approach relies on solving a large-scale mixed-integer programming model that disentangles the assignment decision (which aircraft will pickup and deliver which requirement) from the sequencing decision (in what order the aircraft will pickup and deliver its assigned requirements), using a combination of heuristics and column generation. Through computational experiments with both a simulated data set and a planning data set provided by USTRANSCOM, we show that our approach leads to high-quality solutions for realistic instances (e.g., 100 aircraft and 100 requirements) within operationally feasible time frames.

Forthcoming in Operations Research .",2016,Robust product line design,"The majority of approaches to product line design that have been proposed by marketing scientists assume that the underlying choice model that describes how the customer population will respond to a new product line is known precisely. In reality, however, marketers do not precisely know how the customer population will respond and can only obtain an estimate of the choice model from limited conjoint data. In this paper, we propose a new type of optimization approach for product line design under uncertainty. Our approach is based on the paradigm of robust optimization where, rather than optimizing the expected revenue with respect to a single model, one optimizes the worst-case expected revenue with respect to an uncertainty set of models. This framework allows us to account for parameter uncertainty, when we may be confident about the type of model structure but not about the values of the parameters, and structural uncertainty, when we may not even be confident about the right model structure to use to describe the customer population. Through computational experiments with a real conjoint data set, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach in addressing parameter and structural uncertainty. With regard to parameter uncertainty, we show that product lines designed without accounting for parameter uncertainty are fragile and can experience worst-case revenue losses as high as 23%, and that the robust product line can significantly outperform the nominal product line in the worst case, with relative improvements of up to 14%. With regard to structural uncertainty, we similarly show that product lines that are designed for a single model structure can be highly suboptimal under other structures (worst-case losses of up to 37%), while a product line that optimizes against the worst of a set of structurally distinct models can outperform single model product lines by as much as 55% in the worst case and can guarantee good aggregate performance over structurally distinct models.",Crossref,88.46153846,10.1287/opre.2016.1546,https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1546,2017,Operations Research,ok,"CR-biblio:Robust product line design.

We use this technique to estimate the utility functions of players in a game from their observed actions and to estimate the congestion function on a road network from traffic count data. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that it supports both parametric and nonparametric estimation by leveraging ideas from statistical learning (kernel methods and regularization operators).

Using a three-period model, we determine the optimal reusability level, trade-in and refurbishment policies, trade-in fee, and the prices of new and refurbished units. Our analysis provides a useful framework to understand the interaction between a firm's choice of product reusability and the possibility of supply disruptions. First, we establish a threshold refurbishment policy: the firm refurbishes more as reusability increases but avoids refurbishment at low reusability. When both consumer valuation of used units and supply disruption probability are high, the firm builds a safety-stock of traded-in units, which it refrains from refurbishing when there is no supply disruption, unless the product reusability level is sufficiently high. Second, we find that it benefits to increase product reusability as the supply disruption risk increases until a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold, it is advantageous for the firm to reduce reusability and save on design costs to be profitable, contrary to popular belief. Our numerical examples reveal that the firm reduces reusability when production cost is high due to narrow margins. Finally, we demonstrate that the firm shares the benefits of higher product reusability with its consumers through higher trade-in fees and lower refurbished unit prices. This results in a ¡°Pareto-efficient¡± win for the firm, its trade-in customers, and purchasers of refurbished units.

To address this problem, we develop a two-stage, mixed-integer stochastic dynamic programming model with recourse. The first stage allocates these resources across multiple surgeries with uncertain durations and prescribes the sequence of surgeries to these resources. The second stage determines actual start times to surgeries based on realized durations of preceding surgeries and assigns overtime to resources to ensure all surgeries are completed using the allocation and sequence determined in the first stage. We develop a data-driven robust optimization method that solves large-scale real-sized versions of this model close to optimality. We validate and implement this model as a decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. This system effectively incorporates the flexibility in the resources and uncertainty in surgical durations, and explicitly trades off resource usage and overtime costs. This has increased the average daily utilization of the anesthesiologists by 3.5% and of the operating rooms by 3.8%. This has led to an average daily cost savings of around 7% or estimated to be $2.2 million on an annual basis.

December 2017.",2017,Managing Limited Retail Space for Basic Products: Space Sharing vs,"In this paper, we study the problem of managing limited retail shelf or storage space for basic products by considering two inventory management strategies: space dedication and space sharing. When space is dedicated to each product, there is more flexibility in planning as different products can be replenished independently. In contrast, when space is shared across different products, there is potential for saving space; however, replenishment has to be coordinated across products and this leads to additional costs due to the lack of flexibility in replenishing each product individually. We model this problem as a non-linear mixed integer program and develop an effective heuristic and an upper bound for each strategy.

We modeled this problem as a nonlinear mixed integer programming program comprising disease progression (the transition of the patients across health states), system dynamics (the flow of patients in different health states across various parts of the healthcare delivery system), and budgetary and capacity constraints. We applied the model to the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) station in the Veterans Health Administration system. We found that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine screening policy in which all patients visiting the system are screened for HIV irrespective of risk factors may not be feasible because of budgetary constraints. Consequently, we used the model to develop and evaluate managerially relevant policies within existent capacity and budgetary constraints to improve upon the current risk based screening policy of screening only high risk patients. Our computational analysis showed that the GLA station can achieve substantial increase (20% to 300%) in the QALYs gained by using these policies over risk based screening. The GLA station has already adapted two of these policies that could yield better patient health outcomes over the next few years.

In preparation.",,"Disintermediation in Online Platforms: Price and Reputation Effects, with Shreyas Sekar","Online platforms that rely on commission fees are vulnerable to disintermediation, where buyers and sellers transact off-platform to avoid fees. This phenomenon can significantly reduce platform revenue and, in extreme cases, threaten the platform's viability. For sellers, disintermediation involves giving up the platform's protections against risky buyers (e.g., payment delays or fraud). Sellers must therefore weigh the benefits of avoiding commissions against exposure to potentially risky buyers, with their decision primarily influenced by the quality (or accuracy) of buyer information provided by the platform (e.g., through a reputation system). This paper examines how the threat of disintermediation impacts the platform's optimal pricing strategy, revenue, and information quality. In our model, sellers transact with buyers either on the platform - for a fixed commission - or bypass the platform completely and negotiate an off-platform price. Buyer types are private information; in particular, ""risky"" buyers impose higher transaction costs on sellers in both channels, and additionally withhold payment in the offline channel. To capture information quality, we assume the platform has a technology that generates, with varying degrees of accuracy, a noisy signal of the buyer's type. Our results are summarized as follows. First, in the absence of the offline channel, platform revenue weakly increases in information quality under any fixed commission rate as established in previous works. However, the threat of disintermediation can reverse this effect---the presence of the offline channel can make platform revenue strictly decrease in information quality, due to sellers' improved ability to screen risky buyers. Second, one might assume naively that the prospect of disintermediation would compel the platform to lower its commission rate. In some cases, however, it may be in the platform's interest to ""double down"" and increase its commission rate in response to users transacting offline. Third, although charging sellers upfront to access the platform is robust to disintermediation, this strategy can fall short of the revenue attainable under commissions. This suggests that upfront pricing alone cannot fully recoup revenue losses from disintermediation. Conventional wisdom suggests that an open and information-rich environment can boost on-platform transactions by fostering trust. Our work adds nuance to this view by showing how high information quality can hurt the platform by encouraging buyers and sellers to disintermediate, and in the process alter the platform's pricing strategy.

Major revision, Management Science.",,"Planning Bike Lanes with Data: Ridership, Congestion, and Path Selection, with Sheng Liu and Jingwei Zhang","Urban infrastructure is vital for sustainable cities. In recent years, municipal governments have invested heavily in the expansion of bike lane networks to meet growing demand, promote ridership, and reduce emissions. However, reallocating road capacity to cycling is often contentious because of the risk of amplifying traffic congestion. In this paper, we develop a method for planning bike lanes that accounts for ridership and congestion effects. We first present a procedure for estimating parameters of a traffic equilibrium model, which combines an inverse optimization method for predicting driving times with an instrumental variables method for estimating a commuter mode choice model. We then formulate a prescriptive model that selects paths in a road network for bike lane installation while endogenizing cycling demand and driving travel times. We conduct an empirical study on the City of Chicago that brings together several data sets that describe the urban environment¡ªincluding the road and bike lane networks, vehicle flows, commuter mode choices, bike share trips, driving and cycling routes, demographic features, and points of interest¡ªwith the goal of estimating the impact of expanding Chicago¡¯s bike lane network. We estimate that adding 25 miles of bike lanes as prescribed by our model can lift cycling ridership from 3.6% to 6.1%, with at most a 9.4% increase in driving times. We also find that three intuitive heuristics for bike lane planning can lead to lower ridership and worse congestion outcomes, highlighting the value of a holistic and data-driven approach to urban infrastructure planning.

In this setting, a key input to the principal¡¯s optimal contracting problem is the agent¡¯s production function: the dependence of agent output on effort. Although agent production is classically assumed to be known to the principal, this is unlikely to be the case in practice. Motivated by the design of performance-based incentives, we present a method for estimating a principal-agent model from data on incentive contracts and associated outcomes, with a focus on estimating agent production. The proposed estimator is statistically consistent and can be expressed as a mathematical program. To circumvent computational challenges with solving the estimation problem exactly, we approximate it as an integer program, which we solve through a column generation algorithm that uses hypothesis tests to select variables. We show that our approximation scheme and solution technique both preserve the estimator¡¯s consistency and combine to dramatically reduce the computational time required to obtain sound estimates. To demonstrate our method, we conducted an experiment on a crowdwork platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk) by randomly assigning incentive contracts with varying pay rates among a pool of workers completing the same task.

In response, many domestic suppliers pivoted to producing PPE, such as masks and face shields, made possible by low material costs and simple designs. A key challenge that remained was the lack of an established marketplace for nontraditional suppliers of PPE to connect with healthcare facilities in need. To address this inefficiency, we launched an online platform, Shield-Net, to match requests for face shields with new suppliers of PPE. Our platform was based on an optimization model that produced supplier-requester pairs and took into account request urgency, request size, production capacity, location, and product type. During the period of March to September 2020, Shield-Net produced 390 matches, resulting in the shipment of more than 50,000 face shields to 68 unique requesting organizations.

To entice commuters to travel by public transit instead of driving personal vehicles, municipal governments must address the ¡°last-mile¡± problem by providing convenient and affordable transportation between a commuter¡¯s home and a transit station. This challenge raises an important question: Is there a cost-effective mechanism that can improve public transit adoption by solving the last-mile problem? Academic/practical relevance: In this paper, we present and analyze two incentive mechanisms for increasing commuter adoption of public transit. In a direct mechanism, the government provides a subsidy to commuters who adopt a ¡°mixed mode,¡± which involves combining public transit with hailing rides to/from a transit station. The government funds the subsidy by imposing congestion fees on personal vehicles entering the city center. In an indirect mechanism, instead of levying congestion fees, the government secures funding for the subsidy from the private sector. We examine the implications of both mechanisms on relevant stakeholders. These two mechanisms are especially relevant because several jurisdictions in the United States have begun piloting incentive programs, in which commuters receive subsidies for ride-hailing trips that begin or end at a transit station. Methodology: We present a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions among five self-interested stakeholders (commuters, public transit agency, ride-hailing platform, municipal government, and local private enterprises). Results: By examining equilibrium outcomes, we obtain three key findings. First, we characterize how the optimal interventions associated with the direct or the indirect mechanism depend on: (a) the coverage level of the public transit network; (b) the public transit adoption target; and (c) the relative strength of commuter preferences between driving and taking public transit. Second, we show that the direct mechanism cannot be budget-neutral without undermining commuter welfare. However, when the public transit adoption target is not too aggressive, we find that the indirect mechanism can increase both commuter welfare and sales to the private-sector partner while remaining budget-neutral. Finally, we show that, although the indirect mechanism restricts the scope of government intervention (by eliminating the congestion fee), it can dominate the direct mechanism by leaving all stakeholders better off, especially when the adoption target is modest.

[PDF]",2019,"Data-Driven Incentive Design in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, with Anil Aswani and Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen","The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) was created under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to control escalating Medicare spending by incentivizing providers to deliver healthcare more efficiently. Providers that enroll in the MSSP earn bonus payments for reducing spending to below a risk-adjusted financial benchmark that depends on the provider's historical spending. To generate savings, a provider must invest to improve efficiency, which is a cost that is absorbed entirely by the provider under the current contract. This has proven to be challenging for the MSSP, with a majority of participating providers unable to generate savings due to the associated costs. In this paper, we formulate the MSSP as a principal-agent model and take a data-driven approach to redesigning the MSSP contract. We propose a new type of contract that includes a performance-based subsidy that partially reimburses the provider's investment. We prove that there exists a subsidized contract that dominates the current MSSP contract by producing a strictly higher expected payoff for both Medicare and the provider. We then present a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the parameters of the principal-agent model, using a dataset containing the financial performance of providers enrolled in the MSSP. Based on the estimated model, we find that introducing performance-based subsidies to the MSSP can increase Medicare savings and provider payments over the current contract by 24% and 21%, respectively. Our estimation also reveals that providers with high benchmarks are more likely to generate savings and receive bonus payments, suggesting that the existing MSSP contract may be inadvertently penalizing historically efficient providers through the assignment of lower financial benchmarks.",Semantic Scholar,93.65079365,10.2139/ssrn.2808211,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72810e4f467ef0217eb2c366f628f6e18956c874,2018,Operational Research,ok,"CR-biblio:Data-Driven Incentive Design in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, with Anil Aswani and Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen.

We first provide a formulation for inverse optimization and prove it to be NP-hard. In contrast to existing methods, we show that the parameter estimates produced by our formulation are statistically consistent. Our approach involves combining a new duality-based reformulation for bilevel programs with a regularization scheme that smooths discontinuities in the formulation. Using epi-convergence theory, we show the regularization parameter can be adjusted to approximate the original inverse optimization problem to arbitrary accuracy, which we use to prove our consistency results. Next, we propose two solution algorithms based on our duality-based formulation. The first is an enumeration algorithm that is applicable to settings where the dimensionality of the parameter space is modest, and the second is a semiparametric approach that combines nonparametric statistics with a modified version of our formulation. These numerical algorithms are shown to maintain the statistical consistency of the underlying formulation.

Successful treatment of cardiac arrest is extremely time sensitive, and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) where possible significantly increases the probability of survival. Placement of AEDs in public locations can improve survival by enabling bystanders to treat victims of cardiac arrest prior to the arrival of emergency medical responders, thus shortening the time between collapse and treatment. However, since the exact locations of future cardiac arrests cannot be known a priori, AEDs must be placed strategically in public locations to ensure their accessibility in the event of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest emergency. In this paper, we propose a data-driven optimization model for deploying AEDs in public spaces while accounting for uncertainty in future cardiac arrest locations. Our approach involves discretizing a continuous service area into a large set of scenarios, where the probability of cardiac arrest at each location is itself uncertain. We model uncertainty in the spatial risk of cardiac arrest using a polyhedral uncertainty set that we calibrate using historical cardiac arrest data. We propose a solution technique based on row-and-column generation that exploits the structure of the uncertainty set, allowing the algorithm to scale gracefully with the total number of scenarios. Using real cardiac arrest data from the City of Toronto, we conduct an extensive numerical study on AED deployment public locations. We find that hedging against cardiac arrest location uncertainty can produce AED deployments that outperform an intuitive sample average approximation by 9%¨C15% and cuts the performance gap with respect to an ex post model by half. Our findings suggest that accounting for cardiac arrest location uncertainty can lead to improved accessibility of AEDs during cardiac arrest emergencies and the potential for improved survival outcomes.

However, despite these advances, patient survival rates have not significantly improved. Hence, there is a critical need to develop minimally invasive tools with high sensitivity and specificity to improve patient survival and quality of life. Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive, real-time method for predicting cancer status and potentially serves as a biomarker source for treatment response. Liquid biopsy includes rich biologically relevant components, such as circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are particularly intriguing due to their relatively high abundance in most biofluids, with the potential to identify specific cargo derived from circulating tumor EVs. Moreover, normal cells in lymph nodes can uptake EVs, fostering a pre-metastatic microenvironment that facilitates lymph node metastases - a common occurrence in oral cancers. This review encompasses English language publications over the last twenty years, focusing on methods for isolating EVs from saliva, blood, and lymphatic fluids, as well as the collection methods employed. Seventeen cases met the inclusion criteria according to ISEV guidelines, including 10 saliva cases, 6 blood cases, and 1 lymphatic fluid case.

Next a relative Rota¨CBaxter operator on a group naturally splits the group structure to a post-group structure.

The service sector is at an inflection point with regard to productivity gains and service industrialization similar to the industrial revolution in manufacturing that started in the eighteenth century. Robotics in combination with rapidly improving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, cloud, big data and biometrics will bring opportunities for a wide range of innovations that have the potential to dramatically change service industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential role service robots will play in the future and to advance a research agenda for service researchers.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service, robotics and AI literature.


Findings
The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a definition of service robots, describes their key attributes, contrasts their features and capabilities with those of frontline employees, and provides an understanding for which types of service tasks robots will dominate and where humans will dominate. Second, this paper examines consumer perceptions, beliefs and behaviors as related to service robots, and advances the service robot acceptance model. Third, it provides an overview of the ethical questions surrounding robot-delivered services at the individual, market and societal level.


Practical implications
This paper helps service organizations and their management, service robot innovators, programmers and developers, and policymakers better understand the implications of a ubiquitous deployment of service robots.

As LHC results continue to constrain the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the low pTmiss regime is increasingly valuable to explore. To estimate the backgrounds due to standard model processes in such events, we apply corrections derived from simulation to an estimate based on a control selection in data. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified stealth supersymmetry models with gluino and squark pair production.

Bartram), 2021 Journal of Financial Economics , 139, 2021 (1), 234-259.",2021,"¡°Global Market Inefficiencies,¡± (with S","The pharmaceutical industry plays a crucial role in global healthcare by developing and manufacturing life-saving medications. However, the industry faces several critical challenges that hinder its efficiency and sustainability. One of the foremost challenges is high production costs, which stem from the extensive research, clinical trials, and regulatory approvals required for drug development. Additionally, inefficiencies in drug discovery contribute to prolonged development cycles, as traditional methodologies rely on labor-intensive experimental testing and trial-and-error processes. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions; including delays in raw material procurement, logistical inefficiencies, and unpredictable market demands; impact the accessibility and affordability of essential medications for patients worldwide. These obstacles not only increase financial burdens on pharmaceutical companies but also delay the availability of innovative treatments, potentially affecting public health outcomes.?
In response to these challenges, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative solution capable of optimizing various pharmaceutical processes. AI technologies, particularly Machine Learning (ML), Predictive Analytics, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), offer advanced capabilities in data processing, automation, and decision-making. Machine learning algorithms enable pharmaceutical companies to analyze vast datasets efficiently, identify promising drug candidates with higher accuracy, and streamline clinical trial design. Predictive analytics facilitates data-driven decision-making by forecasting market demand, optimizing production schedules, and reducing wastage in supply chains. Additionally, robotic process automation (RPA) enhances manufacturing operations by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring precision in dosage formulation, and minimizing human errors in quality control processes.?
This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AI¡¯s role in the pharmaceutical sector by exploring its applications in drug discovery, pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and supply chain management. In drug discovery, AI accelerates the identification of novel drug candidates by analyzing molecular structures, biological interactions, and genetic data. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, AI-driven automation improves efficiency, ensures consistency in production, and enhances process optimization. For quality control, AI-integrated systems such as machine vision and deep learning algorithms enable real-time defect detection, contamination identification, and predictive maintenance of equipment, ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory standards. In supply chain management, AI enhances logistics, improves demand forecasting, and mitigates the risks of stock shortages or overproduction by leveraging real-time data insights.? Beyond its numerous benefits, the implementation of AI in pharmaceuticals raises ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure responsible adoption. One major concern is data privacy and security, as AI-driven systems require access to vast amounts of sensitive patient and proprietary pharmaceutical data. Ensuring compliance with regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is crucial to maintaining patient confidentiality and preventing unauthorized access to data. Another significant challenge is bias in AI models, where incomplete or non-representative datasets can lead to disparities in drug recommendations and accessibility, particularly for underrepresented populations. Establishing rigorous data governance policies, algorithm validation techniques, and ethical AI frameworks is essential to mitigate bias and promote fairness in AI-driven pharmaceutical applications. Lastly, accountability and regulatory oversight play a pivotal role in ensuring that AI-generated decisions align with ethical standards and public safety. Clear accountability frameworks must be established to define the responsibilities of AI developers, regulatory bodies, and pharmaceutical companies in overseeing AI-driven processes.?
This research ultimately aims to highlight AI¡¯s potential in revolutionizing pharmaceutical operations while ensuring compliance with ethical, legal, and regulatory standards. By adopting AI-driven innovations responsibly, the pharmaceutical industry can significantly reduce drug development timelines, lower production costs, enhance product quality, and improve patient access to essential medications. The study also identifies areas for future research, including AI-powered generative drug design, personalized medicine, and AI-enabled clinical trials, which could further reshape the pharmaceutical landscape. This paper contributes to the growing discourse on AI¡¯s transformative impact on the pharmaceutical industry and underscores the need for balanced integration that maximizes benefits while addressing ethical and regulatory challenges.",Semantic Scholar,33.02752294,10.18535/cmhrj.v5i1.447,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c98f55d63fdccaae9204143d61e93c09c0a56416,2025,Clinical Medicine And Health Research Journal,ok,"CR-biblio:¡°Global Market Inefficiencies,¡± (with S.

I find that when CLOs are subject to idiosyncratic shocks that push them closer to their covenant constraints, they fire-sell unrelated loans in the secondary loan market to alleviate these constraints. The ex-post, secondary market spread becomes the effective cost of capital for these innocent bystanders, as the expected rate of return across debt instruments is equalized in market equilibrium.

It provides precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strange B meson () and the B0 meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (¦Ì+ and ¦Ì?) are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the standard model. The standard model predicts that the and decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B0 mesons. A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN started operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model predictions. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from proton¨Cproton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts. Here we report the first observation of the ¦Ì+¦Ì? decay, with a statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement so far of its branching fraction. Furthermore, we obtained evidence for the ¦Ì+¦Ì? decay with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. Both measurements are statistically compatible with standard model predictions and allow stringent constraints to be placed on theories beyond the standard model. The LHC experiments will resume taking data in 2015, recording proton¨Cproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 teraelectronvolts, which will approximately double the production rates of and B0 mesons and lead to further improvements in the precision of these crucial tests of the standard model.",Semantic Scholar,45.45454545,10.1038/nature14474,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bb3cff588226c5a50823dc33653e8d72f9490a5,2014,Nature,ok,"CR-biblio:Intermediaries and Asset Prices: Evidence from the U.S., U.K., and Japan, 1870-2016 (with Matt Baron).

In recent decades, those have been considered as possibilities to pretreat recalcitrant wood lignocellulosics for the enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides and the subsequent fermentation of obtained sugars to valuable bioproducts. Current work compares chemistry and technological features of two different cooking processes in the preparation of polysaccharide substrates for deep saccharification with P. verruculosum glycosyl hydrolases. Bleached kraft and sulfite pulps were subjected to hydrolysis with enzyme mixture of high xylanase, cellobiohydrolase, and ¦Â-glucosidase activities at a dosage of 10 FPU/g of dry pulp and fiber concentration of 2.5, 5, and 10%. HPLC was used to analyze soluble sugars after hydrolysis and additional acid inversion of oligomers to monosaccharides. Kraft pulp demonstrated higher pulp conversion after 48 h (74¨C99%), which mostly resulted from deep xylan hydrolysis. Sulfite-pulp hydrolysates, obtained in similar conditions due to higher hexose concentration (more than 50 g/L), had higher fermentability for industrial strains producing alcohols, microbial protein, or organic acids. Along with saccharification, enzymatic modification of non-hydrolyzed residues occurred, which led to decreased degree of polymerization and composition changes in two industrial pulps. As a result, crystallinity of kraft pulp increased by 1.3%, which opens possibilities for obtaining new types of cellulosic products in the pulp and paper industry.

In cold cores and in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks, gas-phase water comes from photodesorption of water ice. We present fitting formulae for implementation in astrochemical models using photodesorption efficiencies for all water ice isotopologues obtained using classical molecular dynamics simulations. We investigate if the gas-phase HDO/H2O ratio reflects that present in the ice or whether fractionation can occur during photodesorption. Probabilities for the top four monolayers are presented for photodesorption of X (X=H,D) atoms, OX radicals, and X2O and HDO molecules following photodissociation of H2O, D2O, and HDO in H2O amorphous ice at temperatures from 10-100 K. Isotope effects are found for all products: (1) H atom photodesorption probabilities from H2O ice are larger than those for D atom photodesorption from D2O ice by a factor of 1.1; the ratio of H and D photodesorbed upon HDO photodissociation is a factor of 2. This process will enrich the ice in deuterium atoms over time; (2) the OD/OH photodesorption ratio upon D2O and H2O photodissociation is on average a factor of 2, but the ratio upon HDO photodissociation is almost constant at unity for all temperatures; (3) D atoms are more effective in kicking out neighbouring water molecules than H atoms. However, the ratio of the photodesorbed HDO and H2O molecules is equal to the HDO/H2O ratio in the ice, therefore, there is no isotope fractionation upon HDO and H2O photodesorption. Nevertheless, the enrichment of the ice in D atoms due to photodesorption can over time lead to an enhanced HDO/H2O ratio in the ice, and, when photodesorbed, also in the gas. The extent to which the ortho/para ratio of H2O can be modified by the photodesorption process is also discussed.

In order to propose suitable solutions to administrate exchange rate policy effectively, this article employs the VAR model, in which the relationship between exchange rate and three objectives of exchange rate policy (including prices, output and trade balance) are tested. The data used in this model is quarterly, in the period 2001q1-2017q3. Based on the results of the VAR model, a number of policy implications has been proposed, including: (i) continuing to apply currency basket pegged exchange rate regime; (ii) in stead of choosing to devaluate VND, the SBV should use other exchange rate management tools; (iii) speeding up the development of derivative exchange rate market is necessary to reduce the level of ERPT to the import price index so that helps to control inflation in Vietnam and (iv) the SBV should prioritize the exchange rate policy administration towards price stability through adopting the inflation-targeting monetary policy.

It examines economic shocks such as recessions, inflation, and trade shocks, alongside noneconomic shocks like migrations, wars, terrorist attacks, pandemics, and natural disasters. Key conclusions emerge: aggregate shocks influence political preferences, risk attitudes, and institutional trust; experiences during young adulthood have stronger, enduring impacts; and economic shocks generally shift preferences toward the political right, while noneconomic yield more varied outcomes depending on the context. The review also evaluates empirical methodologies, their limitations, and mechanisms underlying these effects. By analyzing how shocks alter societal values and behaviors across generations, this work provides insights into the long-term consequences of major disruptions on individual and collective decision-making.

Our analysis focuses on the use of the plough in traditional agriculture. In societies that did not use the plough, women tended to participate in agriculture as actively as men. By contrast, in societies that used the plough, men specialized in agricultural work, due to the physical strength needed to pull the plough or control the animal that pulls it. We hypothesize that this difference caused plough-using societies to value boys more than girls. Today, this belief is reflected in male-biased sex ratios, which arise due to sex-selective abortion or infanticide, or gender-differences in access to family resources, which results in higher mortality rates for girls.

The coronation of King Charles III was steeped in the tradition of magic and ritual that has characterised English, and later British, coronations. The very idea of a coronation leverages belief in divinity; however, the coronation of Charles III occurred in a very different social environment than those of monarchs a millennium ago. Today, belief in the divine right of Kings is dramatically reduced. In this context, magic can also be thought of as a stage performance that relies on a tacit understanding between audience and actor, where disbelief is suspended in order to achieve the effect. This paper will examine the use of ritual and magic in the coronation ceremony. It will discuss how the British royal family has positioned its image in relation to the concept of magic and how social changes have brought the very idea of monarchy into question.
One way to think about magic, according to Leddington (253), is that it has ¡°long had an uneasy relationship with two thoroughly disreputable worlds: the world of the supposedly supernatural ¨C the world of psychics, mediums and other charlatans ¨C and the world of the con ¨C the world of cheats, hustlers and swindlers¡±. While it may be that a magician aims to fool the audience, the act also requires audiences to willingly suspend disbelief. Once the audience suspends disbelief in the theatrical event, they enter the realm of fantasy. The ¡°willingness of the audience to play along and indulge in the fantasy¡± means magic is not just about performances of fiction, but it is about illusion (Leddington 256).
Magic is also grounded in its social practices: the occult, sorcery, and witchcraft, particularly when linked to the Medieval Euro-American witch-hunts of the fifteenth to seventeenth century (Ginzburg). Religion scorned magic as a threat to the idea that only God had ¡°sovereignty over the unseen¡± (Benussi). By the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, intellectuals like Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Max Weber argued that ¡°increases in literacy, better living conditions, and growing acquaintance with modern science, would make people gradually forget their consolatory but false beliefs in spirits, gods, witches, and magical forces¡± (Casanova). Recent booms in Wicca and neopaganism show that modernity has not dismissed supernatural inquiry. Today, ¡®occulture¡¯ ¨C ¡°an eclectic milieu mixing esotericism, pop culture, and urban mysticism¡± ¨C is treated as a ¡°valuable resource to address existential predicaments, foster resilience in the face of the negative, expand their cognitive resources, work on their spiritual selves, explore fantasy and creativity, and generally improve their relationship with the world¡± (Benussi). Indeed, Durkheim¡¯s judgement of magic as a quintessentially personal spiritual endeavour has some resonance. It also helps to explain why societies are still able to suspend belief and accept the ¡®illusion¡¯ that King Charles III is appointed by God. And this is what happened on 6 May 2023 when

millions of people looked on, and as with all magic mirrors, saw what they wanted to see. Some saw a ¡­ victory for the visibility of older women, as if we did not recently bury a 96-year-old queen, and happiness at last. Others saw a victory for diversity, as people of colour and non-Christian faiths, and women, were allowed to perform homage ¡ª and near the front, too, close to the god. (Gold 2023)

¡®We must not let in daylight upon magic¡¯
In 1867, English essayist Walter Bagehot (1826-1877) wrote ¡°above all things our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about it, you cannot reverence it ¡­ . Its mystery is its life. We must not let in daylight upon magic¡± (cited in Ratcliffe). Perhaps, one may argue sardonically, somebody forgot to tell Prince Harry. In the 2022 six-part Netflix special Harry and Meghan, it was reported that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have ¡°shone not just daylight but a blinding floodlight on the private affairs of the royal family¡± (Holden). Queen Elizabeth II had already learnt the lesson of not letting the light in. In June 1969, BBC1 and ITV in Britain aired a documentary titled Royal Family, which was watched by 38 million viewers in the UK and an estimated 350 million globally. The documentary was developed by William Heseltine, the Queen¡¯s press secretary, and John Brabourne, who was the son-in-law of Lord Mountbatten, to show the daily life of the royal family. The recent show The Crown also shows the role of Prince Phillip in its development. The 110-minute documentary covered one year of the royal¡¯s private lives. Queen Elizabeth was shown the documentary before it aired. The following dialogue amongst the royals in The Crown (episode 3, season 4 ¡®Bubbikins¡¯) posits one reason for its production.

It¡¯s a documentary film ¡­ . It means, um ... no acting. No artifice. Just the real thing. Like one of those wildlife films. Yes, except this time, we are the endangered species. Yes, exactly. It will follow all of us in our daily lives to prove to everyone out there what we in here already know. What¡¯s that? Well, how hard we all work. And what good value we represent. How much we deserve the taxpayer¡¯s money. So, we¡¯ll all have to get used to cameras being here all the time? Not all the time. They will follow us on and off over the next few months. So, all of you are on your best behaviour.

As filming begins, Queen Elizabeth says of the camera lights, ¡°it¡¯s jolly powerful that light, isn¡¯t it?¡± In 1977 Queen Elizabeth banned the documentary from being shown in Britain. The full-length version is currently available on YouTube. Released at a time of social change in Britain, the film focusses on tradition, duty, and family life, revealing a very conservative royal family largely out of step with modern Britain. Perhaps Queen Elizabeth II realised too much ¡®light¡¯ had been let in.
Historian David Cannadine argues that, during most of the nineteenth century, the British monarchy was struggling to maintain its image and status, and

as the population was becoming better educated, royal ritual would soon be exposed as nothing more than primitive magic, a hollow sham ... the pageantry centred on the monarchy was conspicuous for its ineptitude rather than for its grandeur. (Cannadine, ""Context"" 102)

By the 1980s, Cannadine goes on to posit, despite the increased level of education there remained a ¡°liking for the secular magic of monarchy¡± (Cannadine, ""Context"" 102). This could be found in the way the monarchy had ¡®reinvented¡¯ their rituals ¨C coronations, weddings, openings of parliament, and so on ¨C in the late Victorian era and through to the Second World War. By the time of Queen Elizabeth¡¯s coronation in 1953, aided by television, ¡°the British persuaded themselves that they were good at ceremonial because they always had been¡± (Cannadine, ""Context"" 108). However, Queen Elizabeth II¡¯s coronation was very much an example of the curating of illusion precisely because it was televised. Initially, there was opposition to the televising of the coronation from both within the royal family and within the parliament, with television considered the ¡°same as the gutter press¡± and only likely to show the ¡°coronation blunders¡± experienced by her father (Hardman 123).
Queen Elizabeth II appointed her husband Prince Phillip as Chair of the Coronation Committee. The Queen was opposed to the coronation being televised; the Prince was in favour of it, wanting to open the ¡°most significant royal ceremony to the common man using the new technology of the day¡± (Morton 134). The Prince argued that opening the coronation to the people via television was the ¡°simplest and surest way of maintaining the monarchy¡± and that the ¡°light should be let in on the magic¡± (Morton 135). Queen Elizabeth II considered the coronation a ¡°profound and sacred moment in history, when an ordinary mortal is transformed into a potent symbol in accordance with centuries-old tradition¡± (Morton 125). For the Queen, the cameras would be too revealing and remind audiences that she was in fact mortal. The press celebrated the idea to televise the coronation, arguing the people should not be ¡°denied the climax of a wonderful and magnificent occasion in British history¡± (Morton 135). The only compromise was that the cameras could film the ceremony ¡°but would avert their gaze during the Anointing and Holy Communion¡± (Hardman 123). Today, royal events are extensively planned, from the clothing of the monarch (Hackett and Coghlan) to managing the death of the monarch (Knight). Royal tours are also extensively planned, with elaborate visits designed to show off ¡°royal symbols, vividly and vitally¡± (Cannadine 115). As such, their public appearances became more akin to ¡°theatrical shows¡± (Reed 4).
History of the ¡®Magicalisation¡¯ of Coronations
British coronations originated as a ¡°Christian compromise with earlier pagan rites of royal investiture¡± and in time it would become a ¡°Protestant compromise with Britain¡¯s Catholic past, while also referencing Britain¡¯s growing role as an imperial power¡± (Young). The first English coronation was at Bath Abbey where the Archbishop of Canterbury crowned King Edgar in 973. When Edward the Confessor came to the throne in 1043, he commissioned the construction of Westminster Abbey on the site of a Benedictine monk church. The first documented coronation to take place at Westminster Abbey was for William the Conqueror in 1066 (Brain).
Coronations were considered ¡°essential to convince England¡¯s kings that they held their authority from God¡± (Young). Following William the Conqueror¡¯s coronation cementing Westminster Abbey¡¯s status as the site for all subsequent coronation ceremonies, Henry III (1207-1272) realised the need for the Abbey to be a religious site that reflects the ceremonial status of that which authorises the monarch¡¯s authority from God. It was under the influence of Henry III that it was rebuilt in a Gothic style, cr",Semantic Scholar,24.65753425,10.5204/mcj.2986,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5ef98a7942726619180f46e0091f3fbc088ce40,2023,M/C Journal,ok,"CR-biblio:Laws, Beliefs, and Backlash Current Version: June 2022",,10.5204/mcj.2986,,Goal 1,0.01491486,FALSE,

C-corporate form confers benefits from perpetual existence, limited liability, potential for public trading of shares, and ability to retain earnings. However, legal changes especially since the 1980s have improved the status of pass-throughs. The C-corporate form has typically been subject to a tax wedge, which has diminished since the 1960s. In our formal model, the tax wedge determines the fraction of firms opting for C-corporate form, the level of output (business productivity), and the C-corporate share of output. This framework underlies our empirical analysis, wherein long-difference regressions for 1978¨C2013 show that a higher tax wedge reduces the C-corporate share of net capital stock and gross assets. A calibrated model, fit to observed total factor productivity (TFP) and C-corporate share of economic activity, implies that, for 1958¨C2013, the declining tax wedge and gap between C-corporate and pass-through productivity contributed 0.37% per year out of a total TFP growth rate of 1.09% per year. From 1994 to 2004, the TFP growth rate was unusually high at 2.00% per year, and the estimated contribution from the falling productivity gap between C-corporate and pass-through status was particularly large at 0.77% per year. The last channel lines up with legal changes related especially to limited liability companies.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100,10.1086/708171,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a86f368d41d3fe472bfa8167086168fb82eefd7,2019,Tax Policy and the Economy,ok,"CR-biblio:Taxes, Incorporation, and Productivity (with Robert Barro), Tax Policy and the Economy , Vol. 34 (2022)","Taxes, Incorporation, and Productivity",10.1086/708171,,Goal 8,0.022629929,FALSE,

In three preregistered experiments ( N = 4,649), participants were exposed to one of a number of money manipulations before completing self-report measures of money activation (Study 1); engaging in a behavioral-persistence task (Study 3); completing self-report measures of subjective wealth, self-sufficiency, and communion-agency (Studies 1¨C3); and completing demographic questions (Studies 1¨C3).

It is estimated that 70 to 100% of all diabetic patients will develop some if not all, diabetic complications over the course of the disease. Despite different symptoms, mechanisms underlying the development of diabetic complications are similar, likely stemming from deficits in both neuronal and vascular components supplying hyperglycaemia©\susceptible tissues and organs.

Both Diaph1 and RAGE are also a part of the RhoA signalling cascade, playing a significant role in the development of neurovascular disturbances underlying diabetes©\related complications.

We also argue that the information processing capabilities of the board moderate this effect: diverse boards and boards with Human Resources committees decrease the employment barriers for foreign workers, whereas shareholder meetings during periods of heightened political risk increase these employment barriers.",Semantic Scholar,22.85714286,10.1177/01492063241300311,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/903e3d696e1cb7761b452b6fc5c88a8d4bee39c3,2024,Journal of Management,ok,"CR-biblio:Norlander  Norlander, P","Norlander, n.1",10.1093/oed/3582409238,,Goal 8,0.076537363,TRUE,migrant workers

Effective strategies are needed to curtail overuse that may lead to harm.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effects of clinician decision support redirecting attention to harms and engaging social and reputational concerns on overuse in older primary care patients.


DESIGN
18-month, single-blind, pragmatic, cluster randomized trial, constrained randomization. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04289753).


SETTING
60 primary care internal medicine, family medicine and geriatrics practices within a health system from 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2022.


PARTICIPANTS
371 primary care clinicians and their older adult patients from participating practices.


INTERVENTION
Behavioral science-informed, point-of-care, clinical decision support tools plus brief case-based education addressing the 3 primary clinical outcomes (187 clinicians from 30 clinics) were compared with brief case-based education alone (187 clinicians from 30 clinics). Decision support was designed to increase salience of potential harms, convey social norms, and promote accountability.


MEASUREMENTS
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men aged 76 years and older without previous prostate cancer, urine testing for nonspecific reasons in women aged 65 years and older, and overtreatment of diabetes with hypoglycemic agents in patients aged 75 years and older and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 7%.


RESULTS
At randomization, mean clinic annual PSA testing, unspecified urine testing, and diabetes overtreatment rates were 24.9, 23.9, and 16.8 per 100 patients, respectively. After 18 months of intervention, the intervention group had lower adjusted difference-in-differences in annual rates of PSA testing (-8.7 [95% CI, -10.2 to -7.1]), unspecified urine testing (-5.5 [CI, -7.0 to -3.6]), and diabetes overtreatment (-1.4 [CI, -2.9 to -0.03]) compared with education only. Safety measures did not show increased emergency care related to urinary tract infections or hyperglycemia. An HbA1c greater than 9.0% was more common with the intervention among previously overtreated diabetes patients (adjusted difference-in-differences, 0.47 per 100 patients [95% CI, 0.04 to 1.20]).


LIMITATION
A single health system limits generalizability; electronic health data limit ability to differentiate between overtesting and underdocumentation.


CONCLUSION
Decision support designed to increase clinicians' attention to possible harms, social norms, and reputational concerns reduced unspecified testing compared with offering traditional case-based education alone. Small decreases in diabetes overtreatment may also result in higher rates of uncontrolled diabetes.

The model is built upon the Normal distribution tolerance interval and tolerance limit theories and methods. The paper discusses several unification features of the model including the unification of the model with literature surveyed sample size determination methods and formulas, the unification with tolerance limits, the unification with variable sampling plans for lot quality level monitoring with hypothesis testing.

Email feedback based on social norms may reduce the number of pills prescribed. Objective To assess the effectiveness of 2 social norm-based interventions on reducing guideline-discordant opioid prescribing after surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants This cluster randomized clinical trial conducted at a large health care delivery system in northern California between October 2021 and October 2022 included general, obstetric/gynecologic, and orthopedic surgeons with patients aged 18 years or older discharged to home with an oral opioid prescription. Interventions In 19 hospitals, 3 surgical specialties (general, orthopedic, and obstetric/gynecologic) were randomly assigned to a control group or 1 of 2 interventions. The guidelines intervention provided email feedback to surgeons on opioid prescribing relative to institutionally endorsed guidelines; the peer comparison intervention provided email feedback on opioid prescribing relative to that of peer surgeons. Emails were sent to surgeons with at least 2 guideline-discordant prescriptions in the previous month. The control group had no intervention. Main Outcome and Measures The probability that a discharged patient was prescribed a quantity of opioids above the guideline for the respective procedure during the 12 intervention months. Results There were 38 235 patients discharged from 640 surgeons during the 12-month intervention period. Control-group surgeons prescribed above guidelines 36.8% of the time during the intervention period compared with 27.5% and 25.4% among surgeons in the peer comparison and guidelines arms, respectively. In adjusted models, the peer comparison intervention reduced guideline-discordant prescribing by 5.8 percentage points (95% CI, ?10.5 to ?1.1; P = .03) and the guidelines intervention reduced it by 4.7 percentage points (95% CI, ?9.4 to ?0.1; P = .05). Effects were driven by surgeons who performed more surgeries and had more guideline-discordant prescribing at baseline. There was no significant difference between interventions. Conclusions and Relevance In this cluster randomized clinical trial, email feedback based on either guidelines or peer comparison reduced opioid prescribing after surgery. Guideline-based feedback was as effective as peer comparison-based feedback. These interventions are simple, low-cost, and scalable, and may reduce downstream opioid misuse.

We relied on our collective experience, an extensive body of literature about community health workers (CHWs), and the other papers in this supplement to identify the most pressing challenges facing CHW programmes and approaches for strengthening CHW programmes. CHWs are increasingly being recognized as a critical resource for achieving national and global health goals. These goals include achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals of Universal Health Coverage, ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and making a major contribution to the control of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and noncommunicable diseases. CHWs can also play a critical role in responding to current and future pandemics. For these reasons, we argue that CHWs are now at the dawn of a new era. While CHW programmes have long been an underfunded afterthought, they are now front and centre as the emerging foundation of health systems. Despite this increased attention, CHW programmes continue to face the same pressing challenges: inadequate financing, lack of supplies and commodities, low compensation of CHWs, and inadequate supervision. We outline approaches for strengthening CHW programmes, arguing that their enormous potential will only be realized when investment and health system support matches rhetoric. Rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and implementation research are also needed to enable CHW programmes to continuously improve their quality and effectiveness. A marked increase in sustainable funding for CHW programmes is needed, and this will require increased domestic political support for prioritizing CHW programmes as economies grow and additional health-related funding becomes available.

Although high vaccine coverage was achieved in Canada by fall 2021, the Omicron variant caused unprecedented numbers of infections, overwhelming testing capacity and making it difficult to quantify the trajectory of population immunity. Methods: Using a time-series approach and data from more than 900 000 samples collected by 7 research studies collaborating with the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (CITF), we estimated trends in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence owing to infection and vaccination for the Canadian population over 3 intervals: prevaccination (March to November 2020), vaccine roll-out (December 2020 to November 2021), and the arrival of the Omicron variant (December 2021 to March 2023).

Although high vaccine coverage was achieved in Canada by fall 2021, the Omicron variant caused unprecedented numbers of infections, overwhelming testing capacity and making it difficult to quantify the trajectory of population immunity. Methods: Using a time-series approach and data from more than 900 000 samples collected by 7 research studies collaborating with the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (CITF), we estimated trends in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence owing to infection and vaccination for the Canadian population over 3 intervals: prevaccination (March to November 2020), vaccine roll-out (December 2020 to November 2021), and the arrival of the Omicron variant (December 2021 to March 2023).

We report the incorporation of a formal nitrene insertion process into the Suzuki¨CMiyaura reaction, altering the products from C¨CC¨Clinked biaryls to C¨CN¨CC¨Clinked diaryl amines and thereby joining the Suzuki¨CMiyaura and Buchwald¨CHartwig coupling pathways to the same starting-material classes. A combination of a bulky ancillary phosphine ligand on palladium and a commercially available amination reagent enables efficient reactivity across aryl halides and pseudohalides, boronic acids and esters, and many functional groups and heterocycles. Mechanistic insights reveal flexibility on the order of bond-forming events, suggesting potential for expansion of the aminative cross-coupling concept to encompass diverse nucleophiles and electrophiles as well as four-component variants. Editor¡¯s summary Two of the most common reactions in pharmaceutical chemistry entail the Pd-catalyzed formation of C¨CC and C¨CN bonds. Onnuch et al. report that conditions under which the two reactants primed to form C¨CC bonds through Suzuki coupling can instead both be coupled to a common N center to form an amine (see the Perspective by Shaughnessy). The intervention, which hinges on a bulky phosphine ligand on Pd and a P-based electrophilic N source, offers a simple means of diversifying existing Suzuki reactant libraries. ¡ªJake S.

Against the backdrop of rapid technological advancement and societal structural transformation, old age has increasingly been associated with negative meanings, especially in so-called Eastern countries, where the tradition of respect for older adults has been eroding. Under such circumstances, younger adults are likely to struggle and be dissatisfied in their communication with older adults, who consider communication with the latter to be rather problematic. Turning to the workplace, which has more recently garnered scholastic attention from intergenerational scholars, older adults tend to suffer from negative age stereotypes and discrimination in this context too.

Less commonly considered are explorations of relationally based negative workplace behaviors-how NWB from Party A is related to reciprocation of NWB from Party B. Based on 2 competing conceptualizations in the literature, that behavior is reciprocated ""in-kind"" in an eye for an eye exchange or that behavior tends to escalate or spiral over time, we develop a framework for negative reciprocity that considers NWB in terms of severity, activity, and target. This framework addresses (a) whether Party A's NWB is associated with behavior of a similar or greater level (i.e., activity and severity) from Party B; and (b) whether Party B's reciprocating behavior is directed back at Party A (i.e., direct) or transferred onto others (i.e., displaced). We meta-analytically test these relationships with 246 independent samples (N = 96,930) and find strongest support for relationships indicating that NWB from Party A is largely returned in-kind, followed closely by relationships indicative of escalation. We also found that as the frequency of Party A's NWB increases, so too does the frequency of reciprocity behavior of equal levels. Surprisingly, differences related to the target of the behavior as well as differences based on whether the data were cross-sectional or longitudinal were generally negligible.

Experiment 1 found that group identification increased self©\labeling with a stigmatizing group label. In Experiment 2, individuals who self©\labeled with a stigmatizing group label felt more identified with their group, which reduced the label's perceived negativity; they also persisted longer on an in©\group helping task, an effect that was partially mediated by group identification. In Experiment 3, observers perceived self©\labelers as more identified with their group and as viewing the label less negatively; perceived group identification mediated the relationship.

But is having limited discretionary time actually detrimental? And can there be downsides of having too much discretionary time? In two large-scale data sets spanning 35,375 Americans and two experiments, we explore the relationship between the amount of discretionary time individuals have and their subjective well-being. We find and internally replicate a negative quadratic relationship between discretionary time and subjective well-being. These results show that whereas having too little time is indeed linked to lower subjective well-being caused by stress, having more time does not continually translate to greater subjective well-being. Having an abundance of discretionary time is sometimes even linked to lower subjective well-being because of a lacking sense of productivity. In such cases, the negative effect of having too much discretionary time can be attenuated when people spend this time on productive activities.

Journal of Consumer Research.",2021,Beliefs about whether spending implies wealth,"Abstract Spending is influenced by many factors. One that has received little attention is the meaning that people give to the act of spending. Spending money might imply that someone is relatively wealthy¡ªsince they have money to spend¡ªor relatively poor¡ªsince spending can deplete assets. We show that people differ in the extent to which they believe that spending implies wealth (SIW beliefs). We develop a scale to measure these beliefs and find that people who more strongly believe that SIW spend their own money relatively lavishly and are, on average, more financially vulnerable. We find correlational evidence for these relationships using objective financial-transaction data, including over 2 million transaction records from the bank accounts of over 2,000 users of a money management app, as well as self-reported financial well-being. We also find experimental evidence by manipulating SIW beliefs and observing causal effects on spending intentions. These results show how underlying beliefs about the link between spending and wealth play a role in consumption decisions, and point to beliefs about the meaning of spending as a fruitful direction for further research.",Crossref,91.11111111,10.1093/jcr/ucaa060,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucaa060,2020,Journal of Consumer Research,ok,"CR-biblio:Kappes, H.

Journal of Consumer Research.",2021,Consumers make different inferences and choices when product uncertainty is attributed to forgetting rather than ignorance,"Abstract When a consumer realizes that information relevant to a consumption decision is missing, such uncertainty can be attributed to ignorance (i.e., the information has never been observed and is unknown) or to memory failure (i.e., the information has been observed and is forgotten). Although research has examined inferences about unknown attributes, no prior work has examined inferences about forgotten attributes. Across six experiments in the lab and in the field, we find that when uncertainty is attributed to ignorance, consumers often make inferences about unknown attributes based on existing correlational evidence (e.g., a brand comparison sheet that could indicate a positive or negative correlation between the unknown attribute and observable attributes). However, when uncertainty is attributed to memory failure, consumers tend to ignore such existing correlational evidence and instead make inferences about forgotten attributes that tend to be positively correlated with known attributes. This process occurs partly because when consumers believe that an attribute was forgotten, they falsely retrieve an impression about the attribute that tends to be consistent with their overall product evaluation. Overall, believing that an attribute is forgotten and believing that it is unknown can lead to opposite inferences and choices.",Crossref,90.16393443,10.1093/jcr/ucz053,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucz053,2019,Journal of Consumer Research,ok,CR-biblio:Walters 2021 Consumers make different inferences and choices when product uncertainty is attributed to forgetting rather,Consumers Make Different Inferences and Choices When Product Uncertainty Is Attributed to Forgetting Rather than Ignorance,10.1093/jcr/ucz053,,Goal 12,0.005112964,FALSE,

First, 2 behavioral studies establish that creative experts indeed succeed at engaging in vivid distal simulations, compared to less creative individuals. Performance on a traditional measure of creativity (Study 1) and real-world success in creative pursuits (Study 2) corresponded with more vivid distal simulations across temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical domains. Study 3 used neuroimaging to identify the neural mechanism supporting creative experts¡¯ simulation success. Whereas creative experts and controls recruit the same neural mechanism (the medial prefrontal cortex) while simulating common or proximal events, creative experts preferentially engage a distinct neural mechanism (the dorsomedial subsystem of the default network) while simulating distal events. Moreover, creative experts showed greater functional connectivity within this network at rest, suggesting they may be prepared to engage this mechanism, by default.

Policy Insights from the Brain and Behavioral Sciences.",2018,"Hershfield, H","In a relatively short period of time, understanding of the fundamental causes of androgen insensitivity syndromes has improved dramatically. This has been brought about by the combination of several disciplines, including endocrinology, genetics, developmental and molecular biology. Mutations can be identified in the androgen receptor gene in suspected cases of AIS, and their functional consequences examined in various in-vitro systems. This information can then be correlated with the clinical presentation of the patient, and is beginning to provide an explanation for the highly variable clinical presentation of AIS. It is to be hoped that this information will also help to predict the likely outcome of androgen therapy in infants with PAIS and an intersex phenotype. More speculatively, functional studies may also lead to novel strategies for the treatment of patients. This would then be of enormous benefit to both patient and parents. Furthermore, the identification of a mutation allows precise information for genetic counselling of families affected by AIS. However, many questions still remain to challenge clinicians and scientists alike. These include the risk of testicular malignancy in patients with AIS and currently there is no worldwide consensus on the stage at which testes should be removed from patients reared as female. There are also significant challenges in patient counselling. Although there is greater understanding of the molecular defects that cause AIS, there are several examples of patients with a similar degree of receptor dysfunction, or even the same mutation, but whose phenotypes are widely different. Other factors must therefore contribute to the clinical presentation of AIS, although these have not been identified. Finally, there are the mutations in patients with Kennedy's disease. The consequences of the mutations are unexplained and are a clear indication that there is still a great deal to discover about the function and biology of androgen receptors.",Semantic Scholar,22.22222222,10.1007/978-1-60327-161-5_10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b7270f8f74527c3a95594c1262e6d8196e84258,2019,Bailli¨¨re's Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,ok,"CR-biblio:Hershfield, H.E., John, E.M., Reiff, J.S.

We also determined quantile-specific age of steepest growth and growth rates. A key goal was to establish age-specific benchmarks for single-word and multiword intelligibility. Method This cross-sectional study involved collection of in-person speech samples from 538 typically developing children (282 girls and 256 boys) who passed speech, language, and hearing screening measures. One thousand seventy-six normal-hearing na?ve adult listeners (280 men and 796 women) orthographically transcribed children's speech. Speech intelligibility was measured as the percentage of words transcribed correctly by naive adults, with single-word and multiword intelligibility outcomes modeled separately. Results The age range for 50% single-word intelligibility was 31¨C47 months (50th¨C5th percentiles), the age range for 75% single-word intelligibility was 49¨C87 months, and the age range for 90% intelligibility for single words was 83¨C120+ months. The same milestones were attained for multiword intelligibility at 34¨C46, 46¨C61, and 62¨C87 months, respectively. The age of steepest growth for the 50th percentile was 30¨C31 months for both single-word and multiword intelligibility and was later for children in lower percentiles. The maximum growth rate was 1.7 intelligibility percentage points per month for single words and 2.5 intelligibility percentage points per month for multiword intelligibility. Conclusions There was considerable variability in intelligibility development among typical children. For children in median and lower percentiles, intelligibility growth continues through 9 years. Children should be at least 50% intelligible by 48 months.

I develop a framework to study this question in a dynamic oligopoly model where firms endogenously engage in investment, entry, exit and mergers. Firms produce vertically differentiated goods, compete by innovating on product quality, and can acquire rival firms to gain market power. In a benchmark model, mergers are modeled to be exclusively harmful to consumers in the short run by reducing competition and increasing prices. Despite this, under standard industry settings it is possible to show that the prospect of a buyout creates a powerful incentive for firms to preemptively enter the industry and invest to make themselves an attractive merger partner. The result is significantly higher rate of innovation with mergers than without and significantly higher long-run consumer welfare as well. Further results explore the circumstances under which this result is likely to hold. In order for the long run increase in innovation to outweigh the short run harm to consumers caused by mergers, entry costs must be low, entrants and incumbents must both have the ability to innovate rapidly, and the degree of horizontal product differentiation must be low.

It represents the third article in a series of papers by the authors (with co-authors; Barseghyan, Molinari, and Thirkettle 2021, Barseghyan et al. 2021) in which they incorporate consumers¡¯ limited consideration when making decisions under risk. In this paper, the authors allow for rich unobserved heterogeneity across consumers: (i) consumers can vary in their preference type, i.e., make decisions according to expected utility theory (EU) and Yaari (1987)¡¯s dual theory (DT); (ii) consumers can vary within each type, i.e., have different coefficients of absolute risk aversion in EU or different coefficients for the parameter guiding the probability distortion function in DT; and (iii) consumers can have different considerations sets, i.e., the sets of alternatives consumers consider before making purchase decisions. Using this set-up, the authors lay out sufficient conditions for semi-parametric point identification in the EU and DT decision frameworks. From an empirical perspective, the most important requirements for the applicability of their findings is access to data on consumer choices in two distinct contexts, e.g., data on consumers¡¯ choices of two different deductibles within the insurance context, and access to all prices for both contexts, i.e., data on prices of chosen and not chosen deductibles for both contexts.

Marketing Science 42(1), 110 - 136.",2023,"R Ursu, Q Zhang, E Honka","Do consumers search the brands they know more or less frequently than the brands with which they are unfamiliar? In this paper, we attempt to answer this question using data from an experiment with two novel features: (i) survey information on consumers¡¯ prior brand ownership, familiarity with each brand, and prior experience using different product features and (ii) eye-tracking data capturing search behavior at a very granular level. We find that consumers are generally more likely to search and buy brands they own and with which they are familiar, highlighting the importance of accounting for prior information. For this reason, we develop a search model in which both the information obtained during the search process and the information possessed by consumers prior to search are allowed to influence search and purchase decisions. Our model contributes to prior work by modeling search at the brand and attribute levels within a Bayesian learning framework. Using this model, we then quantify the impact of prior information on consumer choices as well as document the estimation bias arising when prior information is absent from the model. Finally, through a series of counterfactuals, we explore the managerial value of prior information data. This paper was accepted by Matt Shum, marketing. Funding: Q.

The underlying mechanisms continue being explored.
 Objective: To examine the effect of hyperketonemia on myocardial blood flow (MBF) in patients with HF and T2DM.
 Methods: Subjects with T2DM and HF (EF <50%) received a 6-hr BOHB infusion or a HCO3 infusion (control). A cardiac MRI and a PET study with 18FDG and 15O water were performed before and after the infusion.
 Results: Twelve Subjects were studied (Age=60; BMI=32 kg/m2; A1c = 7.7%). Plasma ketone levels reached 1.6¡À0.2mmol/L. MBF significantly increased in six subjects (¡°responders¡± 1.05¡À0.13 to 1.38¡À0.17, p = 0.003) and decrease in six subjects (¡°non-responders¡± 1.44¡À0.07 to 0.95¡À0.08, p = 0.007). With multivariable analysis, only baseline EF was shown to significantly correlate with the increase in MBF.
 Conclusion: These findings suggest that patients with a higher baseline EF might be more responsive to ketones and be able to increase MBF as an additional mechanism of CV improvement. These novel results shed new light on the potential effect of ketones in different populations of patients with HF and needs to be further explored.

We aimed to assess whether presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) at baseline, and T2D remission following bariatric surgery affect the weight loss outcome. Methods Data of 312 consecutive morbidly obese subjects who underwent bariatric surgery were analysed. Patients underwent either RYGB (77%), or sleeve gastrectomy (23%), and their body weight was followed-up for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5?years at regular ambulatory visits ( N ?=?269, 312, 210, 151, 105, at each year, respectively). T2D remission was assessed according to the ADA criteria. Results In the whole dataset, 92 patients were affected by T2D. Patients with T2D were older than patients without T2D (52?¡À?9 vs 45?¡À?11?years, p ?<?0.0001), but there were no differences in baseline BMI, sex, and type of intervention received.

Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% not of European ancestry), including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P?<?5?¡Á?10?8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores5 in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care.

However, how skeletal muscle (SkM) bioenergetics respond to SGLT2i in T2D and HFrEF remains largely unknown.
 Objective: To explore the effects of empagliflozin on SkM bioenergetics (phosphorus metabolites & myocellular lipid content) at rest and post-exercise (31P & 1H MRS) and cardiac function (MRI). Methods: Subjects with T2D & HFrEF (<40%) (n=6) were randomized 2:1 to empagliflozin 25mg (SGLT2i) or placebo for 12 wks (Age=59¡À2.6, BMI=33.3¡À1.1, A1c=7.1¡À0.3, EF 28¡À4%). A cardiac MRI, & static/dynamic 31P & 1H SkM by MRS, were performed before & after treatment.
 Results: In the empagliflozin group, SkM 31P MRS at rest, showed decrease in phosphodiesterase [PDE]. 31P MRS post-exercise, showed significant improvement in Phosphocreatinine (PCr) recovery, expressed by the K value. 1H MRS showed a reduction of saturated intramyocellular lipids (IMCL-CH2:CH3 ratio).
 Conclusion: Empagliflozin in subjects with T2D and HFrEF had beneficial effects in SkM energy utilization and muscle recovery post-exercise as determined by a decrease in PDE and increase in K value. Additionally, empagliflozin decreased saturated IMCL, which could be expected to improve mitochondrial function and energy utilization. If similar findings were to occur in cardiac muscle, this could provide a novel mechanism for the beneficial CV effects of SGLT2i.

A major challenge in burst-denoising is in coping with pixel misalignment, which was so far handled with rather simplistic assumptions of simple motion, or the ability to align in pre-processing. Such assumptions are not realistic in the presence of large motion and high levels of noise. We show that Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), originally suggested for physics-based novel-view rendering, can serve as a powerful framework for burst denoising. NeRFs have an inherent capability of handling noise as they integrate information from multiple images, but they are limited in doing so, mainly since they build on pixel-wise operations which are suitable to ideal imaging conditions. Our approach, termed NAN111Refer to the project website: noise-aware-nerf.github.io, leverages inter-view and spatial information in NeRFs to better deal with noise. It achieves state-of-the-art results in burst denoising and is especially successful in coping with large movement and occlusions, under very high levels of noise.

What are the downstream emotional consequences? Does carrying debt influence consumers' general sense of satisfaction in life? Seven studies examine the relationship between consumers' debt holdings and life satisfaction, showing that the effect depends on the type of debt. Though mortgages tend to comprise consumers' largest debts, and though credit card balances tend to have the highest interest rates, we found among a diverse sample of American adults (N = 5,808) that the type of debt most strongly associated with lower levels of life satisfaction is student loans. We further found that the extent to which consumers mentally label a given debt type as ""debt"" drives the emotional consequences of those debt holdings, and compared to the other debt types, student loans are perceived more as ""debt."" Together the findings suggest that carrying debt can spill over to undermine people's overall subjective well-being, especially when their debt is perceived as such.

UCLA Anderson Blog.,2020,Staying Happy in Unhappy Times,"A happy and healthy workforce delivers better care. That¡¯s the theory, although the evidence may be elusive. We do know, however, that an unhappy and unwell workforce delivers worse care. The pressures on the workforce are myriad and complex, but with COVID-19 cases rising, at the time of writing, we hear only of problems unsolved and neglect unacknowledged. The workforce crisis is political in the sense that the politicians of the day must address it, and if they do not then their motives and decisions are questioned. Whether other governments would do a better job on the health workforce is unknown, but what is known is that the record of the current UK government is a bad one. Therefore, the workforce becomes political and doctors and other health professionals, when pitted against the government, are easily depicted as radicals. One driver for the crisis in workforce wellbeing and retention, however, seems closer to the heart of the problem. In recent weeks, as international conferences have resumed, I¡¯ve heard health professionals from many countries talk openly about the harm being caused by moral distress, the negative impact on health professionals of their inability to offer a minimum standard of care to patients. Moral distress is a universal phenomenon, and it needs to be more widely acknowledged and addressed. Yet the distress being felt by health professionals has many dimensions. For instance, there is the effect of demonstrable bias in appointment of consultants. It might manifest as a failure to stay updated on how to manage health professionals potentially exposed to HIV. Or reveal itself in battles with technological solutions that overpromise and underdeliver. It may arise from difficulties in helping patients in primary care take up lifestyle interventions. And is certainly exposed by the limited options to support patients with long covid. When we find ourselves in times of trouble, one way out of the distress is to begin with the data. Over the past decade, we¡¯ve seen the growth and helpful impact of a sophisticated methodology called network meta-analysis. Read the story of how network meta-analysis originated, how it works, and how it should be used.

Separately, recent research suggests a relationship between time poverty and college outcomes for student parents and online students. However, to date, no studies have empirically explored whether differential access to time as a resource for college may explain differential outcomes by gender or race/ethnicity. To address this, this study explored the relationship between time poverty, gender or race/ethnicity, and college outcomes at a large urban public university with two and four year campuses. Time poverty explained a significant proportion of differential outcomes (retention and credit accumulation) by gender and race/ethnicity. More time-poor groups also dedicated a larger proportion of their (relatively limited) discretionary time to their education, suggesting that inequitable distributions of time may contribute to other negative outcomes (e.g., reduced time for sleep, exercise, healthcare).

Measurement issues in assessing brand choice models and concentration statistics (in progress),,Empirical Bayes Methods in Marketing,"Abstract Statistical design, analysis, and reporting are fundamental to environmental research and assessment; to environmetrics. The variety and complexity of applications rapidly grows with a commensurate growth in statistical design and analysis. Environmental applications include all aspects of design, the analysis of spatially structured information (exposure, health outcomes, and demographics), nonlinear dose¨Cresponse assays, interspecies extrapolation, placement of air or water monitoring stations, remote sensing, and gene¨Cenvironment interactions. Analytic challenges include stabilizing estimates via statistical modeling and otherwise ¡®borrowing information¡¯, integrating information that is misaligned in space and time, dealing with missing data, accounting for measurement error in input information (e.g. exposures), missing data, causal modeling, addressing nonstandard goals and ensuring that statistical evaluations account for the dominant stochastic and modeling uncertainties. In addressing these and other challenges and goals, Bayes and empirical Bayes (EB) designs and analyses have proven valid, efficient, and informative. The beauty of the Bayesian approach is its ability to structure complicated assessments, guide development of appropriate statistical models and inferences, and produce summaries that properly account for uncertainties. Properly structured, these methods can produce objectively valid analyses, commonly more effective than traditional methods. When available, prior information can be integrated into the design and analysis. Computing innovations enable implementation of complex, relevant models and applications burgeon.

Specifically, in six studies, the authors find that, in sequential choice settings, individuals exhibit significant positive state dependence in risk-taking preferences, such that they are more likely to take a risk when it is similar to a previously taken risk than when it is dissimilar. For example, if an individual has previously taken a health/safety risk, that individual is more likely to take a second health/safety risk than a second risk that is in the financial domain. The authors show that because similarity between risks is malleable and can be determined by situational and contextual variables, subsequent risk-taking intentions can be changed in a predictable manner when similarity is manipulated through framing. The authors establish that increased feelings of self-efficacy and self-signaling through the prior risk-taking experience drive state-dependent risk-taking preferences. The authors further show that the effect of similarity on preferences is not moderated by the outcome received in the prior risk and holds when controlling for individual-level and domain-specific heterogeneity.

Behavioural Public Policy.",2018,The Role of Perceived Effectiveness on the Acceptability of Choice Architecture,"Abstract The success of choice architecture, including its adoption in government policy and practice, has prompted questions of whether choice architecture design decisions are sufficiently transparent and publicly acceptable. We examined whether disclosing to decision-makers that a particular choice architecture is in place reduces its effectiveness and whether an understanding of the effectiveness of choice architecture design decisions increases their acceptability. We find that disclosure of the design decision does not reduce its effectiveness and that individuals perceive the effectiveness of specific designs to be higher for others than for themselves. Perceived effectiveness for self increases when individuals have actually experienced the effect of a design decision rather than having it simply described to them. Perceived effectiveness for oneself and others increases the acceptability of the designs. We also find that the intentions of the source matter more than who the source actually is. Important for policy-makers, then, is that disclosure of design decisions does not reduce their effectiveness, and their acceptability depends on their perceived effectiveness and the inferred motivations of the design architect.",Crossref,92.10526316,10.1017/bpp.2018.1,https://doi.org/10.1017/bpp.2018.1,2018,Behavioural Public Policy,ok,"CR-biblio:Bang, H.

We show that broader choice brackets lead to more optimal risk preferences across all risk types, including negative expected value and pure-loss gambles, suggesting that broad decision framing can help individuals make better choices over risks more generally. We also examine the mechanism behind these bracketing effects. We find that bracketing effects work by attenuating (magnifying) the weight placed on potential losses for positive EV (non-positive EV) gambles and by providing aggregated outcomes that might not otherwise be calculated. Thus, decision frames that provide probability distributions or aggregated outcomes can help individuals maximize expected value across different types of risky prospects.",Crossref,89.18918919,10.1017/s1930297500006252,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1930297500006252,2017,Judgment and Decision Making,ok,CR-biblio:Webb 2017 Is Broad Bracketing Always Better?

The authors offer a possible solution to this challenge: the emergency reserve, or slack with a cost. They demonstrate how an explicitly defined emergency reserve not only is preferred over other options for goal-related programs but can also lead to increased persistence. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers prefer programs with emergency reserves to programs that do not have them, and Study 2 further clarifies that consumers' preference for an emergency reserve depends on the presence of a superordinate goal. Study 3 reveals that consumers prefer goals with emergency reserves because they perceive them to have both higher attainability and value than other goals.

As banks strive to meet the evolving expectations of customers and navigate an increasingly complex regulatory landscape, the role of data analytics in enhancing service quality has become paramount. This review explores how data analytics can be leveraged to improve service quality in the banking sector, offering insights into the methods, benefits, and practical applications of this approach. The review begins by outlining the importance of service quality in banking, emphasizing its impact on customer retention and the overall success of financial institutions. Traditional methods of assessing and improving service quality, such as customer surveys and manual audits, are often limited by their reactive nature and the inability to handle large volumes of data effectively. In contrast, data analytics provides a proactive and comprehensive approach, enabling banks to identify patterns, predict trends, and make data-driven decisions that enhance service delivery. Data analytics encompasses various techniques, including descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, each offering unique benefits for service quality improvement. Descriptive analytics allows banks to gain insights from historical data, identifying key areas for improvement. Predictive analytics uses statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future customer behavior, enabling banks to anticipate needs and address potential issues before they escalate. Prescriptive analytics goes a step further by recommending specific actions to optimize service quality, based on the analysis of past and predicted data. Key areas where data analytics can significantly enhance service quality in banking include customer relationship management (CRM), operational efficiency, and risk management. In CRM, data analytics enables banks to personalize services, segment customers effectively, and predict their needs with greater accuracy. This personalized approach not only enhances customer satisfaction but also fosters loyalty and long-term relationships. Operational efficiency is another critical area where data analytics can drive improvements. By analyzing transaction data, banks can optimize processes, reduce waiting times, and improve the overall customer experience. For instance, data-driven insights can help banks streamline branch operations, optimize ATM placements, and manage workforce allocation more effectively. Risk management, particularly in the areas of fraud detection and credit risk assessment, also benefits from data analytics. Advanced analytics techniques can detect unusual patterns and flag potential fraud in real-time, reducing the risk of financial losses and enhancing trust. Similarly, predictive models can assess credit risk more accurately, ensuring that banks make informed lending decisions and maintain a healthy loan portfolio. The adoption of data analytics in banking is not without challenges. Issues such as data privacy, security, and the need for skilled personnel to interpret and act on data insights are significant considerations. However, with the right strategies and technologies in place, these challenges can be effectively managed, paving the way for substantial improvements in service quality. Data analytics offers a powerful toolset for banks aiming to enhance service quality. By leveraging data-driven insights, banks can deliver more personalized, efficient, and secure services, ultimately leading to greater customer satisfaction and competitive advantage. As the banking sector continues to evolve, the integration of data analytics into service quality improvement strategies will be essential for staying ahead in a competitive market.",Semantic Scholar,36.76470588,10.62225/2583049x.2025.5.1.3749,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c95e4bc5b26a9d9f0e7c8bf712980f2b891b5258,2025,International Journal of Advanced Multidisciplinary Research and Studies,ok,CR-biblio:¡°Managing Marketing Risk by Improving Customer Retention¡±,,10.62225/2583049x.2025.5.1.3749,,Goal 17,0.038664736,FALSE,data accountability

Prior research has focused on means (e.g., monetary vs. nonmonetary incentives). Our theory highlights the importance of schemes, with a focus on how they interact with social relationships. It posits that the efficacy of incentives depends largely on whether the scheme fits the relational structure of the persons involved in the activity: participation incentive schemes for communal sharing relations, hierarchy for authority ranking relations, balancing for equality matching relations, and proportional incentive schemes for market pricing relations. We show that these four schemes encompass some of the most prevalent variants of incentives. We then discuss the antecedents and consequences of the use of congruent and incongruent incentive schemes. We argue that congruent incentives can reinforce the relationship. Incongruent incentives disrupt relational motives, which undermines the coordinating relationship and reduces effort. But, importantly, incongruent incentives can also be used intentionally to shift to a new relational model. The theory thus contributes to research on relational models by showing how people constitute and modulate relationships. It adds to the incentives and contracting literatures by offering a framework for analyzing the structural congruence between incentives and relationships, yielding predictions about the effects of incentives across different organizational and individual-level contexts.

Motivation theory and the emerging body of empirical literature suggest that awards can have a significant effect on employee motivation and corporate performance, though not always in the intended direction. Awards can also destroy value. The organizational award literature has so far largely neglected this important issue. We develop a synthesis of the dimensions critical for successful award bestowals, and analyze under which conditions awards generate firm©\specific value that is sustained and difficult for competitors to imitate. The process of value creation and capture is contingent on the given firm's organizational characteristics and nature of production. The article concludes by laying out empirical implications. JEL codes: M52, M54, J24, J30. Managerial summary : Awards are widely used in the corporate sector. They fundamentally differ from monetary incentives, which risk crowding out employees' intrinsic motivation. Among the variety of awards, two general types can be distinguished: confirmatory awards based on explicit, pre©\determined performance criteria, and discretionary awards, which rely on broad performance evaluations and may be used ex post to honor outstanding performance. Appropriately designed and adjusted to the specific firm's characteristics, awards enhance employees' motivation and corporate performance. They express recognition and support their recipients' perceived competence and social status. Awards help to retain valuable employees and to establish role models. However, awards may also backfire, for instance, when they provoke envy among coworkers. We propose when awards risk destroying value and when they are particularly useful .

Findings ¨C Awards have the potential to substantially increase performance, yet they are less frequently used in the Swiss voluntary sector than theory suggests. Research limitations/implications ¨C The focus lies on awards in academia and the voluntary sector. Future research should investigate awards in other fields, e.g. the for-profit or the cultural sector. It should also assess their use in other countries to facilitate cross-country comparisons. The effects on non-recipients and the public at large are another area worth investigating.

By decreasing the potential liability of US-listed foreign firms, particularly due to class action lawsuits, Morrison arguably eroded their legal bonding to compliance with disclosure duties. Nevertheless, we find evidence of an increase or insignificant change in share values. Tests of longer-run effects of the legal event indicate that foreign firms¡¯ disclosure quality and likelihood of facing enforcement actions remained stable, as did investors¡¯ revealed preferences for trading on US markets.

Whether gender differences in self presentation of clinical research exist and may contribute to this gender gap has been challenging to explore empirically. The objective of this study was to analyze whether men and women differ in how positively they frame their research findings and to analyze whether the positive framing of research is associated with higher downstream citations. Design Retrospective observational study. Data sources Titles and abstracts from 101 720 clinical research articles and approximately 6.2 million general life science articles indexed in PubMed and published between 2002 and 2017. Main outcome measures Analysis of article titles and abstracts to determine whether men and women differ in how positively they present their research through use of terms such as ¡°novel¡± or ¡°excellent.¡± For a set of 25 positive terms, we estimated the relative probability of positive framing as a function of the gender composition of the first and last authors, adjusting for scientific journal, year of publication, journal impact, and scientific field. Results Articles in which both the first and last author were women used at least one of the 25 positive terms in 10.9% of titles or abstracts versus 12.2% for articles involving a male first or last author, corresponding to a 12.3% relative difference (95% CI 5.7% to 18.9%). Gender differences in positive presentation were greatest in high impact clinical journals (impact factor >10), in which women were 21.4% less likely to present research positively. Across all clinical journals, positive presentation was associated with 9.4% (6.6% to 12.2%) higher subsequent citations, and in high impact clinical journals 13.0% (9.5% to 16.5%) higher citations. Results were similar when broadened to general life science articles published in journals indexed by PubMed, suggesting that gender differences in positive word use generalize to broader samples. Conclusions Clinical articles involving a male first or last author were more likely to present research findings positively in titles and abstracts compared with articles in which both the first and last author were women, particularly in the highest impact journals.

Introduction:This is a unique case of diabetes insipidus (DI) presenting as a complication of cholestasis of pregnancy. We will review the pathophysiology and treatment of gestational DI. Clinical case:A 37-year-old Caucasian female G2P1 with Dichorionic Diamniotic (DCDA) twins presented to hospital at 33 weeks¡¯ gestation with premature uterine contractions. She complained of sudden onset of increased thirst and urine output over the preceding 24 hours, drinking 5.5 litres. Her past history was significant for diet controlled gestational diabetes, iron deficiency and an uneventful first pregnancy. She was clinically hypovolemic with reduced skin turgor and hypotension. A serum sodium was 139 (135-145) mmol/L, serum osmolality 292 (275-295) mmol/Kg, urine sodium 66 (40-220) mmol/L and urine osmolality 235 (350-1000) mmol/Kg . Her glucose levels were well controlled. Her liver function panel was consistent with cholestasis of pregnancy with elevated bile acids 68umol/L (0-6) and no anatomical obstruction on liver ultrasound. She was commenced on ursofalk 500mg three times daily. A comprehensive assessment of the pituitary axis and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland was unremarkable. A single dose of oral desmopressin (DDAVP) 200mcg was given with rapid improvement in urine output within 1 hour, reducing from 300ml/hr to 75ml/hr. Urine output improved to 1.1L over 24hours. A repeat serum sodium 24hrs after DDAVP was 136mmol/L and serum osmolality 284mmol/kg. Due to worsening liver function, she underwent an emergency caesarean section. The patient and both neonates made a full recovery post-partum. Discussion: Gestational DI or transient DI in pregnancy is rare, occurring in 2-4/100 000 pregnancies. It occurs due to increased placental syncytiotrophoblast production of vasopressinase which rapidly breaks down vasopressin. This is different from central DI and nephrogenic DI; although these conditions can also be exacerbated in pregnancy. Production of vassopressinase increases through pregnancy up to 1000-fold in the 3rd trimester, with greater production in patients with larger placental volume and reduced clearance in patients with liver dysfunction. Gestational DI may be missed as polyuria is often dismissed as a normal part of pregnancy but if untreated can cause severe dehydration and uteroplacental deficiency adversely affecting both mother and baby. Confirming the diagnosis requires monitoring of fluid input and output and paired serum and urine sodium and osmolality. It is best to avoid water deprivation testing due to the risks of dehydration in pregnancy.

We investigate this question by identifying 2 distinct types of daily work planning to explain why and when planning improves employees' daily performance. The first type is time management planning (TMP)-creating task lists, prioritizing tasks, and determining how and when to perform them. We propose that TMP enhances employees' performance by increasing their work engagement, but that these positive effects are weakened when employees face many interruptions in their day. The second type is contingent planning (CP) in which employees anticipate possible interruptions in their work and plan for them. We propose that CP helps employees stay engaged and perform well despite frequent interruptions. We investigate these hypotheses using a 2-week experience-sampling study. Our findings indicate that TMP's positive effects are conditioned upon the amount of interruptions, but CP has positive effects that are not influenced by the level of interruptions. Through this study, we help inform workers of the different planning methods they can use to increase their daily motivation and performance in dynamic work environments.

Competitive intensity is measured by the degree of product substitutability. A tension arises between the incentive to influence the rival&#8217;s pricing or output decision by sharing information on R&amp;D innovations and the incentive to avoid knowledge spillovers that allow the rival to also benefit. We show that either no or partial disclosure equilibrium prevails. In contrast to a commonly held view of an inverse relation between competition and disclosure, we identify conditions on knowledge spillovers, under which more disclosure transpires in equilibrium as competition intensifies. This result holds, irrespective of whether firms engage in price or quantity competition.

Using data in 785,604 individuals of European ancestry, we identify 43 genomic loci associated with either number of children ever born (NEB) or childlessness. These loci span diverse aspects of reproductive biology across the life course, including puberty timing, age at first birth, sex hormone regulation and age at menopause. Missense alleles in ARHGAP27 were associated with increased NEB but reduced reproductive lifespan, suggesting a trade-off between reproductive ageing and intensity. As NEB is one component of evolutionary fitness, our identified associations indicate loci under present-day natural selection. Accordingly, we find that NEB-increasing alleles have increased in frequency over the past two generations. Furthermore, integration with data from ancient selection scans identifies a unique example of an allele¡ª FADS1/2 gene locus¡ªthat has been under selection for thousands of years and remains under selection today.

Working paper.",,"Francisco Castro, Peter Frazier, Hongyao Ma, Hamid Nazerzadeh, Chiwei Yan","Motivated in part by online marketplaces such as ridesharing and freelancing platforms, we study two-sided matching markets where agents are heterogeneous in their compatibility with different types of jobs: flexible agents can fulfill any job, whereas each specialized agent can only be matched to a specific subset of jobs. When the set of jobs compatible with each agent is known, the full-information first-best throughput (i.e. number of matches) can be achieved by prioritizing dispatch of specialized agents as much as possible. When agents are strategic, however, we show that such aggressive reservation of flexible capacity incentivizes flexible agents to pretend to be specialized. The resulting equilibrium throughput could be even lower than the outcome under a baseline policy, which does not reserve flexible capacity, and simply dispatches jobs to agents at random. 
 
To balance matching efficiency with agents' strategic considerations, we introduce a novel robust capacity reservation policy (RCR). The RCR policy retains a similar structure to the first best policy, but offers additional and seemingly incompatible edges along which jobs can be dispatched. We show a Braess' paradox-like result, that offering these additional edges could sometimes lead to worse equilibrium outcomes. Nevertheless, we prove that under any market conditions, and regardless of agents' strategies, the proposed RCR policy always achieves higher throughput than the baseline policy.

Specifically, we examine the two key objectives of this regulation: (1) mitigating climate change by diverting organic waste from landfills, and (2) addressing food insecurity by redistributing recovered food to communities in need. We interviewed 37 stakeholders, including food recovery organizations, jurisdiction representatives, and edible food generators involved in implementation. Additionally, we analyzed the distribution of Local Assistance Grant funds across California counties and between the policy¡¯s dual goals. Our findings indicate a stronger focus on waste diversion than food recovery, and an uneven distribution of funding, with rural areas facing greater challenges in adapting to SB 1383¡¯s requirements.

Existing discussion of ARV allocation is focused on qualitative rules for prioritizing certain socioeconomic and demographic patient segments over others at the national level. However, such prioritization rules are of limited utility in providing quantitative guidance on scaling up of treatment programs at individual clinics. In this study, we take the perspective of a clinic administrator whose objective is to maximize the quality©\adjusted survival of the entire patient population in its service area by allocating scarce and unreliable supply of drugs among two activities: initiating treatment for untreated patients and continuing treatment for previously treated patients. The key trade©\off underlying this allocation decision is between the marginal health benefit obtained by initiating an untreated patient on treatment and that obtained by avoiding treatment interruption of a treated patient. This trade©\off has not been explicitly studied in the clinical literature, which focuses either on the incremental value obtained from initiating treatment (over no treatment) or on the value of providing continuous treatment (over interrupted treatment) but not on the difference of the two. We cast the clinic's problem as a stochastic dynamic program and provide a partial characterization of the optimal policy, which consists of dynamic prioritization of patient segments and is characterized by state©\dependent thresholds. We use this structure of the optimal policy to design a simpler Two©\Period heuristic and show that it substantially outperforms the Safety©\Stock heuristic, which is commonly used in practice. In our numerical experiments based on realistic parameter values, the performance of the Two©\Period heuristic is within 4% of the optimal policy whereas that of the Safety©\Stock heuristic can be as much as 20% lower than that of the optimal policy.

Specifically, we investigate whether water scarcity, which results from environmental conditions, influences manufacturing firms to lower their toxic releases to the environment. We created a data set that spans 2000¨C2016 and includes details on the toxic emissions of 3,092 manufacturing facilities in Texas. Additionally, our data set includes measures of the water scarcity experienced by these facilities. Our econometric analysis shows that manufacturing facilities reduce their toxic releases into the environment when they have experienced drought conditions in the previous year. We examine facilities that release toxics to water as well as facilities with no toxic releases to water. We find that the reduction in total releases (to all media) is driven mainly by those facilities that release toxic chemicals to water. Further investigation at a more granular level indicates that water scarcity compels manufacturing facilities to lower their toxic releases into media other than water (i.e., land or air). The impact of water scarcity on toxic releases to water is more nuanced. A full-sample analysis fails to link water scarcity to lower toxic releases to water, but a further breakdown shows that manufacturing facilities in counties with a higher incidence of drought do lower their toxic releases to water.

Such systems often involve numerous input parameters. It is crucial to understand how susceptible the solutions are to uncontrolled variations or uncertainties within these input parameters. This knowledge helps in identifying critical factors that significantly influence the model¡¯s outcomes and can guide efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions. Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a method used efficiently to assess the sensitivity of the output results from large-scale mathematical models to uncertainties in their input data. By performing SA, we can better manage risks associated with uncertain inputs and make more informed decisions based on the model¡¯s outputs. In recent years, researchers have developed advanced algorithms based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique for computing numerical sensitivity indicators. These methods have also incorporated computationally efficient Monte Carlo integration techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation of Monte Carlo algorithms based on ¡°symmetrized shaking¡± of Sobol¡¯s quasi-random sequences. The theoretical proof demonstrates that these algorithms exhibit an optimal rate of convergence for functions with continuous and bounded first derivatives and for functions with continuous and bounded second derivatives, respectively, both in terms of probability and mean square error. For the purposes of numerical study, these approaches were successfully applied to a particular problem. A specialized software tool for the global sensitivity analysis of an air pollution mathematical model was developed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted regarding some important air pollutant levels, calculated using a large-scale mathematical model describing the long-distance transport of air pollutants¡ªthe Unified Danish Eulerian Model (UNI-DEM). The sensitivity of the model was explored focusing on two distinct categories of key input parameters: chemical reaction rates and input emissions. To validate the theoretical findings and study the applicability of the algorithms across diverse problem classes, extensive numerical experiments were conducted to calculate the main sensitivity indicators¡ªSobol¡¯ global sensitivity indices. Various numerical integration algorithms were employed to meet this goal¡ªMonte Carlo, quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC), scrambled quasi-Monte Carlo methods based on Sobol¡¯s sequences, and a sensitivity analysis approach implemented in the SIMLAB software for sensitivity analysis. During the study, an essential task arose that is small in value sensitivity measures. It required numerical integration approaches with higher accuracy to ensure reliable predictions based on a specific mathematical model, defining a vital role for small sensitivity measures. Both the analysis and numerical results highlight the advantages of one of the proposed approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly for relatively small sensitivity indices.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4409893188,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Data, models and decisions for large-scale stochastic optimization.

ETE is a critical prognostic marker for thyroid tumors, necessitating accurate preoperative assessment. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of computed tomography (CT)-based grading for ETE and tracheal invasion (TI) for preoperative prediction in patients with differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and compare the diagnostic accuracy with ultrasound (US). Materials and methods This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. Preoperative US and CT were performed for 83 patients who underwent surgery for PTC between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2020. The US and CT features of ETE and TI of each case were retrospectively and independently investigated by two radiologists. The diagnostic performances of US and CT, including their specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for ETE, and their accuracy in predicting ETE and TI were analyzed. As per the grading for ETE on USG and CT, lesions were graded into three grades and Mahajan grading was also devised on CT to predict the TI and graded into four grades. Results The accuracy and specificity of CT are relatively good for identifying tumor infiltration into the adjacent structures and range from 82% to 87% and 95% to 98%, respectively. It, however, has a low sensitivity, between 14.3% and 77.78%, when compared to US, which suggests that in case of any doubt regarding CT evidence of tumor infiltration into surrounding structures, additional clinical examination must be performed. CT showed better sensitivity (78%) and specificity (75%) in detecting TI compared to previous studies. The diagnostic accuracy of CT Mahajan grading was 91.5% with p &amp;lt; 0.005 in the prediction of TI. Conclusion Preoperative US should be regarded as a first-line imaging modality for predicting minimal ETE, and CT should be additionally performed for the evaluation of maximal ETE. The specificity and PPV of CT are higher than those of US in detecting overall ETE and TI of PTC.

Global patterns of DNA methylation are drastically reprogrammed in primordial germ cells and early embryonic development in mammals. This reprogramming has been well characterized in mouse embryos, but a detailed understanding of DNA methylation dynamics in human embryos is lacking. Two papers published this week [in this issue of Nature] reveal there is a massive loss of DNA methylation from most of the human genome immediately after fertilization, confirming that this epigenetic reprogramming is an evolutionarily conserved feature of development. Hongshan Guo et al. produced base-resolution maps of DNA methylation for human gametes and at several developmental stages of embryogenesis. Zachary Smith et al. obtained similar maps of DNA methylation at several developmental stages of early human embryogenesis and during derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines. The studies provide insights into differences between mouse and human methylation dynamics and the functional relationship between DNA methylation and the expression of genes and transposable elements. DNA methylation is a crucial element in the epigenetic regulation of mammalian embryonic development1,2,3,4,5. However, its dynamic patterns have not been analysed at the genome scale in human pre-implantation embryos due to technical difficulties and the scarcity of required materials. Here we systematically profile the methylome of human early embryos from the zygotic stage through to post-implantation by reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing. We show that the major wave of genome-wide demethylation is complete at the 2-cell stage, contrary to previous observations in mice. Moreover, the demethylation of the paternal genome is much faster than that of the maternal genome, and by the end of the zygotic stage the genome-wide methylation level in male pronuclei is already lower than that in female pronuclei. The inverse correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression gradually strengthens during early embryonic development, reaching its peak at the post-implantation stage. Furthermore, we show that active genes, with the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) mark at the promoter regions in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells, are essentially devoid of DNA methylation in both mature gametes and throughout pre-implantation development. Finally, we also show that long interspersed nuclear elements or short interspersed nuclear elements that are evolutionarily young are demethylated to a milder extent compared to older elements in the same family and have higher abundance of transcripts, indicating that early embryos tend to retain higher residual methylation at the evolutionarily younger and more active transposable elements. Our work provides insights into the critical features of the methylome of human early embryos, as well as its functional relation to the regulation of gene expression and the repression of transposable elements.",LandingPage(meta/jsonld),0,,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13544,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Guo  , Tang, C",,10.1038/nature13544,,Goal 16,0.025619081,FALSE,

It is unknown whether legacy effects follow a short period of very low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved with statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor. Methods and results In 18,924 patients post-acute coronary syndrome, the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial compared the PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab with placebo, each added to high-intensity or maximum-tolerated statin therapy. Patients with two consecutive LDL-C levels &amp;lt;0.39 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) on alirocumab had blinded placebo substitution for the remainder of the trial with continued statin treatment. In post hoc analyses, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in these patients were compared to MACE in propensity score-matched patients from the placebo group with similar baseline characteristics and study medication adherence. In the alirocumab group, 730 patients had blinded placebo substitution at a median 8.3 months from randomization, after a median 6.0 months with LDL-C &amp;lt; 0.39 mmol/L. They were matched to 1460 placebo patients. Both groups had lower baseline LDL-C and lipoprotein(a) and better study medication adherence than the overall cohort.

Bakhtin¡¯s early years found him joining small groups of like-minded intellectuals eager to escape the social and political turmoil of Russia in the late 1910s. In the late 1920s he wrote several of his most important works, influenced by discussions with colleagues Valentin Voloshinov and Pavel Medvedev (now called the ¡°Bakhtin circle¡±); indeed, some scholars claim that books authored by Voloshinov and Medvedev were actually written by Bakhtin. Bakhtin¡¯s participation in these intellectual circles is likely one reason why he was arrested in 1929 and sent to exile at a hard labor camp in the north where he almost certainly would have died if not for his already poor health (his leg was injured and later amputated in the late 1930s) and the intervention of well-placed family and friends that diverted him instead to Kazakhstan. After five years of exile Bakhtin was released and permitted to begin a teaching career. During this time he wrote extensively, having completed Problems of Dostoevsky¡¯s Poetics, Discourse in the Novel, and in 1941, Rabelais and His World, which he submitted as his doctoral dissertation. A locally popular figure in the 1950s and 1960s, Bakhtin lectured and taught and would have remained relatively unknown if it were not for a group of scholars who admired his writings and helped to popularize them. After Bakhtin¡¯s death, his writings were translated into English (in the 1970s and 1980s), where they quickly found influence. Bakhtin is now included as one of the most prominent social theorists of the 20th century. Bakhtin¡¯s major concepts include dialogue (and monologue), heteroglossia, genre, carnival/carnivalesque, centripetal/centrifugal forces, and authorship. Dialogue may be the most commonly referenced Bakhtinian concept and yet it may also be the most misunderstood. Dialogue in a Bakhtinian sense is an expansive philosophy that considers that all communication is dialogic, where meaning can only be understood in its social context. The concept of intertextuality, while never explicitly identified in Bakhtin¡¯s work, was developed by Kristeva from Bakhtin¡¯s thinking. This as well as other Bakhtinian concepts have greatly influenced scholars in the fields of communication, where his influence became widespread beginning in the 1990s and 2000s. In particular, this influence has been felt in the disciplines of rhetoric, interpersonal communication, organizational communication, intercultural communication, and mass communication. This entry concentrates primarily on English-language essays and empirical studies using Bakhtin¡¯s concepts in each of these fields in communication.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4233313710,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:Read about Mikhail Chernov¡¯s research in UCLA Anderson Review,,,,Goal 1,0.018844859,FALSE,

The paper identifies political beliefs based on statistical area votes in national elections held in Israel on the eve of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. Unlike the U.S. and elsewhere, pandemic policy intervention in Israel was broadly supported by politicians across the belief spectrum. As such, household response to virus risk was not biased by contemporaneous partisan disagreement and debate among political leaders. Findings show, all things equal, that in the wake of emergent and localized virus risk, voters in politically right-of-center and religious areas displayed substantially higher odds of both vaccine resistance and virus transmission as compared to their left-center counterparts. Moreover, political belief is highly salient to aggregate pandemic outcomes. Model simulation shows that had all areas responded to virus risk with the more risk-averse behaviors of left-of-center areas, the number of vaccinations nationwide would have increased by 15 percent. That same scenario results in a full 30 percent reduction in total infection cases. Results also show that coercive policy measures such as economic closure were more effective in reducing virus transmission among less risk-averse right-wing and religious areas. Findings provide new evidence of the role of political belief in household response to health risks.

[ Download ]",,Darren J,"Molecular approaches to understanding the functional circuitry of the nervous system promise new insights into the relationship between genes, brain and behaviour. The cellular diversity of the brain necessitates a cellular resolution approach towards understanding the functional genomics of the nervous system. We describe here an anatomically comprehensive digital atlas containing the expression patterns of &#8764;20,000 genes in the adult mouse brain. Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes. Unbiased fine-resolution analysis has identified highly specific cellular markers as well as extensive evidence of cellular heterogeneity not evident in classical neuroanatomical atlases. This highly standardized atlas provides an open, primary data resource for a wide variety of further studies concerning brain organization and function. A new frontier has been reached in both neuroscience and genetics. The expression of each of the roughly 22,000 genes of the mouse genome has been mapped, at cellular resolution, across all major structures of the mouse brain. This achievement is part of the Allen Brain Atlas project. Lein et al. describe the development of the atlas (freely available on http://www.brain-map.org ) and report gene expression patterns that both support and challenge established views of brain anatomy. The atlas includes in situ images and &#39;heat maps&#39; of signal intensity for each gene and brain region on a colorimetric scale. Despite predictions that the brain would express a limited number of genes, about 80% of all mouse genes are expressed; 70% of gene signals localize to fewer than 20% of all brain cells, suggesting that most localize to small brain regions.

Current basic knowledge of K in soils and plant physiology and nutrition is discussed which is followed by sections dealing specifically with future needs for basic and applied research on K in soils, plants, crop nutrition and human and animal nutrition. The section on soils is devoted mainly to the concept of K availability. The current almost universal use of exchangeable K measurements obtained by chemical extraction of dried soil for making fertilizer recommendations is questioned in view of other dominant controlling factors which influence K acquisition from soils by plants. The need to take account of the living root which determines spatial K availability is emphasized. Modelling of K acquisition by field crops is discussed. The part played by K in most plant physiological processes is now well understood including the important role of K in retranslocation of photoassimilates needed for good crop quality. However, basic research is still needed to establish the role of K from molecular level to field management in plant stress situations in which K either acts alone or in combination with specific micronutrients. The emerging role of K in a number of biotic and abiotic stress situations is discussed including those of diseases and pests, frost, heat/drought, and salinity. Breeding crops which are highly efficient in uptake and internal use of K can be counterproductive because of the high demand for K needed to mitigate stress situations in farmers&#8217; fields. The same is true for the need of high K contents in human and animal diets where a high K/Na ratio is desirable. The application of these research findings to practical agriculture is of great importance. The very rapid progress which is being made in elucidating the role of K particularly in relation to stress signalling by use of modern molecular biological approaches is indicative of the need for more interaction between molecular biologists and agronomists for the benefit of agricultural practice. The huge existing body of scientific knowledge of practical value of K in soils and plants presents a major challenge to improving the dissemination of this information on a global scale for use of farmers.

The papers in this volume flesh out and formalize these concerns, but also provide important responses in two ways: by suggesting domains where they are unlikely to be applicable (primarily related to survey research of various kinds) and versions of QV (using an artificial currency) that maintain many of QV&#8217;s benefits while diffusing the most important critiques.

The Review of Financial Studies 30(2), 2017, pp. 505-535 ( Online Appendix )",2016,¡° Asset Pricing when 'This Time is Different '¡± January 2016,"In the mainstream economics there is assumed that all individuals maximizing their selfish goals contribute to maximizing social welfare. At the company level, this objective is formulated as maximizing shareholder value. This mechanism works, if there are no externalities, which can be said to occur when the actions of one entity cause costs or benefits to another economic entity and there is no compensation for the effects of that action. This leads to a sub-optimal allocation of resources and, as a result, maximum social welfare is not achieved. An example of externalities is greenhouse gas emissions, which are linked to global warming. According to a special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)1, a 1.5?C increase in global warming will make extreme weather events more frequent and more widespread in their effects. Natural resources, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security &amp;ndash; in a word, civilization &amp;ndash; will suffer (IPCC, 2018). However, global warming is not the only challenge of contemporary society. Unemployment, world hunger, inequality in general, armed conflicts or pandemics are all constraints on efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In the hierarchy of human needs, satisfying hunger is more important than breathing clean air or protecting the climate. Introducing regulations that will result in numerous company bankruptcies and mass redundancies will not find social acceptance. The market mechanism must be corrected and pressure put on businesses to take action to reduce emissions. However, this incentive must not be destructive to the economy. In addition, each country has different resources, is at a different level of economic development and, as a result, has different opportunities to reduce emissions. International cooperation is therefore essential. As de Schoutheete suggests, this can be compared to managing interdependence. For in the reality of political life we are dealing with a complex system of functional management of socio-economic interdependencies involving groups, communities, regions and nations in search of meaning and purpose (de Schoutheete, 1997, p. 149). The best example of international cooperation on climate protection is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter UNFCCC or Climate Convention). In the framework of the Climate Convention, parties declare and negotiate emission reduction commitments, which are then attached as protocols or contributions to a binding agreement. Both the European Union (EU) and its individual members are parties to the UNFCCC. The European Emissions Trading Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the EU ETS) is the main tool for implementing the commitments undertaken by the EU and its members in the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC. The system was established on 13 October 2003 (Directive 2003/87/EC) and became operational in January 2005. It covers about 45% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The EU&amp;rsquo;s target under the EU ETS was to achieve emissions 21% lower than in 2005 by 2020. The post-2020 assumptions were revised in July 2015. It was determined that the sectors covered by the scheme by 2030 would have to reduce emissions by 43% compared to 2005. The question arises as to whether the EU&amp;rsquo;s objectives are not too ambitious and undermine social welfare. An assessment of the impact of the EU ETS on businesses may provide an answer to this question. While paying attention to the objective of companies, this assessment must deal with their value. This choice also reinforces the synthetic nature of this financial category, which is the resultant of all spheres of a company&amp;rsquo;s operation2. The introduction of corrective regulations should increase the value of some companies and decrease that of others. The only negative impact of the regulations on the value of enterprises can therefore be equated with a decrease in social welfare in material terms. Assessing the impact of the introduction of the EU ETS on company value is a huge challenge, as the issue is multi-faceted and interdisciplinary. Therefore, solving the problem required dividing the research into several stages and adopting several, inherently debatable, assumptions. In the first chapter the fundamental significance of the surplus rate, i.e. the difference between profitability and the cost of capital, for the value of a company was proved. An in-depth assessment of the impact of the introduction of the EU ETS on company value can therefore be based on this financial category. It has also been noted that emission allowances have many characteristics of taxes. As a result, the important methodological reference of the thesis to theories directly and indirectly explaining the relationship between taxes and firm value was justified. This is of considerable importance as the relationship between taxes and company value has a very strong theoretical basis, as evidenced, for example, by theories of company valuation. In the case of the impact of greenhouse gas emission allowances on company value, the acquis on international tax competition and tax incidence (tax shifting) can be particularly useful. If international competition in environmental regulation was unfair, then the introduction of the EU ETS should affect company value. However, the ability of companies to shift costs forward and/or backward is a constraint. In th is aspect, it is reasonable to refer to tax incidence studies based on the analysis of the profitability of companies. On the one hand, they enrich the existing research on the phenomenon of cost shifting of emission allowances. On the other hand, they correspond to the excess return component. The discussion in chapter two shows that there are numerous forms of environmental regulations in the world. However, it is difficult to assess whether they ensure fair international competition. Even similar regulations (e.g. organised emissions trading) have numerous exceptions and detailed rules. Moreover, all regulations have been subject to numerous modifications over the years. The design of the EU ETS includes a number of mechanisms to protect participants in the system from loss of competitiveness, as well as rules that respect their diversity (national and sectoral). However, not all differences between enterprises have been taken into account, especially those related to the size of enterprises. Large companies are more active in the allowance market, use more sophisticated tools to manage their emissions and have lower measurement, reporting and verification costs per tonne of carbon emitted. They may therefore experience unintended benefits or disproportionate cost-sharing. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of investments resulting in greenhouse gas reductions is linked to the individual characteristics of companies. Therefore, the assessment of the impact of emission allowances on company value has to be carried out at the microeconomic level. The review of the literature on the impact of the EU ETS on broadly defined company value, made in the third chapter demonstrates the uncoordinated and fragmented nature of these studies. Of particular importance, however, is the research on profitability and the cost of capital. As proved in the first chapter, profitability, cost of capital and enterprise value are all in a strong relationship with each other, which under several assumptions takes the form of a functional relationship. It is possible to formulate a consistent and theoretically firmly grounded method of analysing the impact of emission allowances on company value. First, it was decided to analyse the impact of allowances on corporate profitability. Following the example of Krzy?aniak and Musgrave&amp;rsquo;s study on the tax incidence, a variable was included which represents the ratio of the size of the &amp;ldquo;tax liability&amp;rdquo; due to the need to purchase allowances (EUAs) to the invested capital. This variable took the form of the ratio of missing emission allowances to total assets. For the selection of control variables, research in resource-based organizational theory was primarily used. This choice was supported by a large number of papers in which corporate profitability was the explained variable. The study of the impact of emission allowances on the profitability of enterprises was carried out on a balanced sample of 1,083 enterprises, in 2008&amp;ndash;2016 (the number of observations was 9,747). The information used in the analysis came from two sources &amp;ndash; the ORBIS database and the database of the Directorate-General for the Environment of the European Commission. The analyses of the impact of emission allowances on profitability in the short term (Arellano-Bond and Blundell-Bond models) show that after including in the model a variable representing the change in sales revenues, the examined variable (the ratio of missing emission allowances to the value of assets) ceases to be statistically significant. In contrast, including only productivity in the model was devoid of such an effect3. This means that in the short term, enterprises mainly shift the cost of allowances by changing the price of their products, while productivity takes time to improve. The long-run study shows that the ratio of missing allowances to total assets had a significant positive impact on companies&amp;rsquo; profitability. This may imply that companies had the ability to shift the cost of allowances and did so with a surplus. This result would be consistent with the conjecture appearing in the literature that companies would pass on allowance costs to consumers by raising prices. However, when a variable representing the change in sales revenues was placed in the model, the directional coefficient of the variable under study (the ratio of missing allowances to assets) was only slightly reduced and the variable remained statistic",OpenAlex(DOI),0,10.2139/ssrn.2373495,https://openalex.org/W4402276215,2013,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-biblio:  ¡° Asset Pricing when 'This Time is Different '¡± January 2016,Asset Pricing when 'This Time is Different',10.2139/ssrn.2373495,,Goal 13,0.120918584,TRUE,GHG emissions; UNFCCC; carbon emissions; carbon footprint; carbon pricing; climate change; climate commitments; climate finance; climate governance; climate impact reduction; climate investment; climate mitigation; climate policy; climate-related hazards; emissions reduction; global climate action; global warming; greenhouse gas emissions; industrial emissions; institutional capacity for climate action; transport emissions

Patients and Methods We employed a multiarm study design, each representing a sarcoma subtype with its own Simon optimal two-stage design. In each arm, 12 patients who received 0 to 1 prior lines of therapy were treated (0 to 3 for angiosarcoma and malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor). If at least one Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) was observed, 25 further patients with that sarcoma subtype were accrued. Results Between October 2005 and November 2007, 145 patients were treated; 144 were eligible for toxicity and 122 for response. Median age was 55 years; female-male ratio was 1.8:1. The median number of cycles was 3. Five of 37 patients with angiosarcoma had a partial response (response rate, 14%). This was the only arm to meet the RECIST response rate primary end point. Median progression-free survival was 3.2 months; median overall survival was 14.3 months. Adverse events (typically dermatological) necessitated dose reduction for 61% of patients. Statistical modeling in this limited patient cohort indicated sorafenib toxicity was correlated inversely to patient height. There was no correlation between phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase expression and response in six patients with angiosarcoma with paired pre- and post-therapy biopsies. Conclusion As a single agent, sorafenib has activity against angiosarcoma and minimal activity against other sarcomas. Further evaluation of sorafenib in these and possibly other sarcoma subtypes appears warranted, presumably in combination with cytotoxic or kinase-specific agents.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W2144530818,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:106.

Gender gaps in various outcomes (competitiveness, labour force participation, and performance in mathematics, among many others) show remarkable differences across countries and tend to persist over time. The economics literature initially explained these differences by looking at standard economic variables such as the level of development, women¡¯s education, the expansion of the service sector, and discrimination. More recent literature has argued that gender differences in a variety of outcomes could reflect underlying cultural values and beliefs. This article reviews the literature on the relevance of culture in the determination of different forms of gender gap. I examine how differences in historical situations could have been relevant in generating gender differences and the conditions under which gender norms tend to be stable or to change over time, emphasizing the role of social learning. Finally, I review the role of different forms of cultural transmission in shaping gender differences, distinguishing between channels of vertical transmission (the role of the family), horizontal transmission (the role of peers), and oblique transmission (the role of teachers or role models).",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4245327207,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:¡°Gender and Culture¡±, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 2020, 36 (4), 944-961",,,,Goal 5,0.146767251,TRUE,gender and technology; gender bias; gender discrimination; gender disparities; gender equality; gender equity; gender inequality; gender norms; gender wage gap; gender-focused policies; gender-sensitive policies

One story consistent with the data on elderly trends is that older Americans worry that redistribution will come at their expense, in particular through cuts to Medicare.

The selection of topics and the way they are presented are influenced by their research areas and interests. The second edition of the book Aperiodic Crystals. From Modulated Phases to Quasicrystals is no exception. There exist already a number of monographs on the different classes of aperiodic crystals (ACs), incommensurately modulated phases (IMPs), composite crystals (CCs) and quasicrystals (QCs). The present book Aperiodic Crystals tries to present all three classes together in a unified manner, showing what ACs have in common, and in which ways they differ from one another. This is the big plus of the book. Compared with the monographs, the focus is less on crystallography and structures but more on dynamics and physical properties. By definition, an ideal AC is characterized by a discrete pure point Fourier spectrum supported on a Z-module of rank n > d, with d the dimension of the AC. Consequently, their structures and dynamics can be described within the framework of the higherdimensional approach. However, there are fundamental differences concerning their relationships to periodic reference lattices: IMPs can be seen as incommensurate modulations and CCs as intergrowths of d-dimensional (dD) periodic structures; in contrast, QCs can be described in dD space based on their underlying tilings only. Furthermore, all known stable QCs exhibit non-crystallographic rotational diffraction symmetry (N = 5, 8, 10, 12). This would not be possible for IMPs and CCs due to the existence of their periodic average structures. Also, our understanding of the three classes of ACs is on different levels. While the physics of IMPs and CCs is quite well understood nowadays, this is certainly not the case for QCs. In particular, there are still many open questions concerning their formation, growth and stability (see also Steurer, 2018). Overall, the book has grown by 66 pages, from 466 pages in the first edition [see also the book review by Clarke (2008)] to the current 532 pages. A few of these new pages are dedicated to more recent developments in AC research, topics such as superspace and crystal chemistry, soft QCs or the natural QCs found in meteorites. A few pages are taken by a couple of exercises and solutions, which have been added to chapters 1, 2 and 3. A little bit disappointing is the part dealing with QC structures and their analysis. There are just three examples discussed in detail, the same as in the first edition. Since more than 50 QCs and a similar number of approximants have been studied to date, a table listing them together with some characteristic parameters would have been quite useful for showing their abundance and diversity. I have not found any hint of the problem of multiple diffraction that can strongly bias the weak reflections in a QC diffraction data collection. The weak reflections are crucial for determining the long-range quasiperiodic order. Although a new section on the growth of QCs has been added in the second edition, the most recent growth simulations (e.g. Kuczera & Steurer, 2015) have not been mentioned, for instance. In my opinion, the ten years of QC research between the first (2007) and second (2018) editions, reflected in 2500 publications, did not find an adequate representation in the new edition.

This situation could raise the global international inflation rate, provoking the devaluation of different currencies against the dollar. The increased cost of maritime transport will affect some products, impacting their added value. For instance, some furniture, textile, handcraft, artisanal candles, clothing, and leather products could lose their competitive advantage for their emerging producer economies. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, maritime freight rates are expected to remain high for at least one year, affecting economic trade and demand worldwide and causing a shortage of several products. Such a situation is a critical effect of the lockdowns that slowed down industrial activity. The vertiginous increase in freight transportation rates is due to a multiplicity of factors, the vast majority of them having to do with the pandemic, and it is not yet clear how long this crisis could last. This ongoing crisis is known as the ""container crisis"" and entails an unusual shortage of available space to transport products from Asia to the rest of the world. Besides the lack of containers and high shipping costs, there have been port jams and temporary shutdowns in some terminals due to strict measures to control the new covid-19 strains. We hope that the massive vaccine rollout worldwide could improve the maritime transportation flow, which moves 99% of the total load (in tons) worldwide. The Colombian industry has suffered a shortage of raw materials, over-production costs, and long delays in lead times, forcing some small- and medium-sized companies to shut down due to inputs being unavailable for their average production. Editorial Note The Journal Cuadernos de Administraci¨®n needs to thank Prof. Carlos Hernan Gonzales for his invaluable years' long work as an editor that allowed the Journal significant achievements. Among the most significant achievements is the Journal being categorized in the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI). We hope that Prof. Carlos Hernan will continue supporting the Journal through his participation in the editorial board team. The Journal brings new, significant changes seeking to increase its visibility and ranking: Calls for papers for each volume will be relinquished, and a permanent call for papers will be in place. The Journal will have a ""Forthcoming Papers"" section, papers that will have been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication but are not yet published because final changes are pending and still need to be assigned a volume or issue. The order they are published does not indicate the order of their final assignment to a volume. These papers can be cited as forthcoming papers. According to the following link, papers must meet a minimum level of English above the 75th percentile https://secure.aje.com/en/researcher/grammar-check. This 71st issue of the Journal Cuadernos de Administraci¨®n corresponds to the September-December 2021 period. The eight papers published in issue 71 come from the previous call, whose authors submitted their manuscripts to our editorial process from several countries and different regions of Colombia. The Journal thanks our reviewers, who supported us through their experience and expertise in assessing each paper. The eight research papers published attest to the high quality of several aspects in business, marketing, finance, and social responsibility, among other areas. The first paper, called ""Visual neuromarketing strategies in two shopping malls in the city of C¨²cuta, Colombia,"" seeks to describe the visual neuromarketing practices present in two shopping malls in the city of C¨²cuta (Colombia). A quantitative study with a descriptive, non-experimental, cross-sectional design using an observation guide and a questionnaire is implemented. The second paper, called ""Case Analysis: Financial viability for the commercialization of physicochemical testing services at the Antioquia Liquor and Alcohol Factory (ALAF),"" studies market profitability for physicochemical testing of alcoholic beverages according to the transformation in its legal nature. The proposed approach includes the costing of tests by using accounting and the analytical procedures used by the laboratory. The paper ""A framework explaining the entrepreneurial intentions of engineering students in public universities"" seeks to explain the Entrepreneurial Intent (EI) of university students enrolled in engineering programs at the public university of the state of Guanajuato (Mexico). The proposed approach combines the Theory of Planned Behavior, formal and informal institutional factors, and two individual traits. The fourth paper, ""Corporate Governance and Organizational Social Responsibility: discussion about the Multilatinas case,"" explores the relationship between Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility. This relationship is analyzed considering the interest of the majority-owners-block-family and CEO about the firm outlays for the Organizational Social Responsibility. The paper ""Announcements Effect of Corporate Bond Issuance on Stock Returns: Evidence from Chile"" measures the effect of announcing a corporate bond issuance on stock returns for companies listed on the Santiago de Chile Stock Exchange (BCS). An event study measures the effect of announcing a corporate bond issuance on stock return, and this methodology calculates abnormal returns for the days of the event. In the work ""Internationalization and open innovation in SMEs from the horticultural sector in Colombia,"" the authors empirically assess the relationship between open innovation, exploration, and exploitation activities in the context of internationalization of horticultural-sector SMEs' from Northern Valle del Cauca, Colombia. The study is based on a sample of 102 SMEs and the determination of a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to test a series of research hypotheses. The last research paper, ""Sustainable segmentation for ecological personal hygiene products in the hard discount format,"" considers the issue of sustainable consumption of personal hygiene products in countries like Colombia. A quantitative approach with a descriptive correlational scope was employed to analyze the relationship between consumers' environmental practices and their intention of purchasing personal hygiene products. Finally, the last paper, a reflection paper called ""Bank financing management with a value chain approach in Cuba,"" tackles the value chain concepts and the value chain approach from productive articulation. The methodology used in this work includes the analysis, synthesis, and deduction of the theoretical-methodological aspects of bank financing management. The Universidad del Valle's Faculty of Administration's 71st issue of Cuadernos de Administraci¨®n consolidates us as a prestigious Journal for disseminating scientific knowledge in several areas.

Additionally, accounting for the fact that these claims may also stand to benefit a wider range of people and appeal to more abstract principles, we show that this preference is driven by the perception that digressive victimhood claims are more effective at silencing further criticism from the non-dominant group. Underscoring that these claims may be used strategically, we observed that individuals high in outgroup prejudice were willing to express a positive endorsement of the digressive victimhood claims even when they did not fully support the principle they claimed to be defending (e.g., freedom of religion or speech).

Osmoregulatory roles for the CNSS have been hypothesized, but molecular regulation of the CNSS following changes in environmental salinity remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we performed transcriptomics on the CNSS of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) to establish: (1) how the CNSS responds following seawater (SW) transfer, and (2) which endocrine systems contribute to osmoregulatory responses in the CNSS. Responses following SW transfer varied at 24 h versus 168 h, with changes primarily affecting membrane transport and transcriptional processes at 24 h and neuronal processes at 168 h. Components of several osmoregulation©\associated endocrine systems were affected (e.g., corticosteroid receptors), including some that have not previously been identified in the CNSS (e.g., calcitonin). Additionally, transcript levels of corticotropin©\releasing factor (CRF) peptides¡ªwhich have osmoregulatory functions and were highly abundant in the CNSS¡ªwere approximately twofold higher after 24 h in SW. Therefore, we performed additional experiments investigating CRF peptides in a more euryhaline salmonid, Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ). Smolts had up to 12©\fold higher levels of CRF peptide transcripts than parr, but abundance declined following SW transfer. Additionally, CRF transcripts were lower 24 h following freshwater transfer of SW©\acclimated salmon. These results suggest that CRF peptides acutely aid in coordinating physiological responses following fluctuations in environmental salinity via anticipatory and/or responsive mechanisms.

The sign effect in past and future discounting .",2018,"Molouki, S","Abstract African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a highly lethal disease in pigs and represents a significant threat to the global pork industry due to the lack of effective vaccines or treatments. Despite intensive research, many ASFV proteins remain uncharacterized. This study aimed to elucidate the functions of two ASFV proteins, MGF360-21R and A151R, through comprehensive analysis of their interactions with host proteins. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid screening approaches, we identified the host protein barrier- to-autointegration factor 1 (BANF1) as a key interactor of both viral proteins. Biochemical and colocalization assays confirmed these interactions and demonstrated that MGF360-21R and A151R expression leads to cytoplasmic relocalization of BANF1. Functionally, BANF1 silencing significantly reduced ASFV replication, indicating its proviral role. Given BANF1¡¯s established function in regulating the cGAS/STING-dependent type I interferon (IFN-I) response, we postulated that A151R and MGF360-21R could inhibit this pathway. Using different strategies, we showed that both A151R and MGF360-21R did indeed inhibit IFN-I induction. Generation of ASFV deficient of A151R or MGF360-21R showed that both mutant viruses enhanced the host IFN response in primary porcine macrophages compared to wild-type virus. However, their capacity to inhibit this pathway could occur through mechanisms independent of BANF1. Proteomic analysis of BANF1 interactors during ASFV infection highlighted potentially roles in chromatin remodeling, nuclear transport, and innate immune response pathways. Altogether, our data provide new insights into ASFV-host interactions, identifying BANF1 as an important new host factor required for replication and uncovering novel functions for A151R and MGF360-21R. Author Summary African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a highly contagious and deadly disease affecting pigs worldwide, for which there are currently no effective vaccines or treatments. Despite extensive research, many ASFV proteins remain poorly understood. Our study investigated two ASFV proteins, MGF360-21R and A151R, to better understand their functions and interactions with host proteins. Using proteomic approaches, we found both these viral proteins interact with a host protein called barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BANF1). Importantly, BANF1 silencing significantly reduced ASFV replication, indicating its important role in the viral life cycle. We also showed that MGF360-21R and A151R help the virus evade the immune system by blocking the production of interferons, which are key defensive molecules against viral infections. However, this immune evasion does not seem to depend on their interaction with BANF1. Additionally, our analysis of BANF1¡¯s interactions during ASFV infection revealed potential roles in chromatin remodeling, nuclear transport, and the innate immune response. These findings provide new insights into how ASFV interacts with its host and highlight BANF1 as a critical factor in viral replication and immune evasion. Our work contributes to a better understanding of ASFV and could pave the way for developing more effective strategies to fight this virus.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4405097944,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Molouki, S., Hardisty, D.

Within EHRs, seemingly innocuous menu design configurations can influence provider decisions for better or worse. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the grouping of menu items systematically affects prescribing practices among primary care providers. We surveyed 166 primary care providers in a research network of practices in the greater Chicago area, of whom 84 responded (51 % response rate). Respondents and non-respondents were similar on all observable dimensions except that respondents were more likely to work in an academic setting. The questionnaire consisted of seven clinical vignettes. Each vignette described typical signs and symptoms for acute respiratory infections, and providers chose treatments from a menu of options. For each vignette, providers were randomly assigned to one of two menu partitions. For antibiotic-inappropriate vignettes, the treatment menu either listed over-the-counter (OTC) medications individually while grouping prescriptions together, or displayed the reverse partition. For antibiotic-appropriate vignettes, the treatment menu either listed narrow-spectrum antibiotics individually while grouping broad-spectrum antibiotics, or displayed the reverse partition. The main outcome was provider treatment choice. For antibiotic-inappropriate vignettes, we categorized responses as prescription drugs or OTC-only options. For antibiotic-appropriate vignettes, we categorized responses as broad- or narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Across vignettes, there was an 11.5 percentage point reduction in choosing aggressive treatment options (e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics) when aggressive options were grouped compared to when those same options were listed individually (95&nbsp;% CI: 2.9 to 20.1&nbsp;%; p&#8201;=&#8201;.008). Provider treatment choice appears to be influenced by the grouping of menu options, suggesting that the layout of EHR order sets is not an arbitrary exercise.

The small body of work examining intraminority intergroup relations, or relations between members of different disadvantaged groups, reveals that salient experiences of ingroup discrimination promote positive relations between groups that share a dimension of identity (e.g., 2 different racial minority groups) and negative relations between groups that do not share a dimension of identity (e.g., a racial minority group and a sexual minority group). In the present work, we propose that shared experiences of discrimination between groups that do not share an identity dimension can be used as a lever to facilitate positive intraminority intergroup relations. Five experiments examining relations among 4 different disadvantaged groups supported this hypothesis. Both blatant (Experiments 1 and 3) and subtle (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) connections to shared experiences of discrimination, or inducing a similarity-seeking mindset in the context of discrimination faced by one's ingroup (Experiment 5), increased support for policies benefiting the outgroup (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and reduced intergroup bias (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Taken together, these experiments provide converging evidence that highlighting shared experiences of discrimination can improve intergroup outcomes between stigmatized groups across dimensions of social identity. Implications of these findings for intraminority intergroup relations are discussed.

U.K. and Northampton, MA USA: Edward Elgar.",2015,Sustainable careers: Then and now,"This chapter examines sustainable careers within an historical context. We begin with a group of 1970s scholars who believed that studying careers required sensitivity to both psychological experiences and social context over time. Their approach provided a foundation for the interdisciplinary perspective reflected in our Handbook of Career Theory (1989), an explicit recognition that career theory's home involves many disciplines, at many levels of analysis. Much has changed since then. Sustainable careers require that individuals recognize responsibility for their work within, across and outside organizations. They also require that organizations find innovative solutions for helping individuals reach their full potential while maximizing their institutions' performance. However, much of the earlier work on careers can still inform the sustainable careers' dialogue: we have a durable definition of career, everyone has a career, careers are interdependent with people's lives, and an interdisciplinary approach is more important than ever.

Communicating Between Groups, Communicating About GroupsBuilding from the introductory chapter, this chapter will elaborate on social identity theory and its intellectual sister theories (e.g., self-categorization theory).Further, we will focus particularly on language strategies used in an intergroup context (i.e., labels, language abstractness, and metaphors) and intergroup communication related to specific social groups (i.e., gender, race, and more fluid categories such as socio-geographical background and sexual orientation).More specifically this chapter is structured in three parts that follow a brief overview of intergroup communication in relation to social identity, self-categorization, and communication accommodation theory.In the first part, we will discuss three language tools that play a prominent role in communicating within, across, and about social groups.These include group labels, which can create friendly or hostile intergroup relations and can induce stereotype threat in those targeted by the same label.In the second part, we will cover language abstraction and metaphors, both of which can play a very important role in intergroup communication, as they reflect, maintain, and create intergroup bias and aid stereotype dissemination.Whereas in the first part of the chapter we will be referring to groups in general (with some specific examples), in the second part we will address issues related to important social categories.We will address gender and race and, subsequently, more fluid categories such as social class, geographical/regional background, and sexual orientation.The section on gender will cover issues related to grammatical gender (e.g., actor vs. actress) and the consequences of using masculine forms to represent both females and males.The part on interracial communication will address the issue of race/ethnicity in terms of labels we use to address different groups as well as what we know about interaction between people of different races.In the section on fluid social categories, we will discuss the effect that subtle acoustic cues have on the perception of social groups with malleable 4 category boundaries such as social class or sexual orientation.In the final section, our concluding remarks about intergroup communication will highlight the most important issues in our current knowledge, and outline possible future directions in which research may move.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,10.2307/jj.14491562.11,https://openalex.org/W4256200309,2022,The Impact of Devolution in Wales,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-biblio:McCann 2019 IECHYD DA,IECHYD DA?,10.2307/jj.14491562.11,,Goal 1,0.077198385,TRUE,gender-sensitive strategies

Additionally, this research examines whether deep-level perceived similarity interacts with leader-member dyadic communication agreement in predicting group member performance ratings at later time periods in a work group¡¯s development. The relationship between shared cultural context and perceived and actual similarity is also investigated. Design/methodology/approach This research analyzes longitudinal data from the study questionnaires at five occasions in a Malaysian organization. Findings Results based on a sample of 28 group projects and 141 matching dyad who completed the study questionnaires at 5 occasions reveal that there is no interaction between workgroup relational ethnicity and workgroup relational gender with leader-member dyadic agreement at early time periods in a workgroup¡¯s development. Therefore, H1 is not supported. H2 posited that deep-level perceived similarity will interact with leader-member dyadic communication agreement in predicting group member performance ratings at later time periods in a workgroup¡¯s development. H2 is supported. Results reveal that the interaction between leader-member dyadic communication agreement and perceived similarity explains 36 percent of the variance of perceived group members¡¯ performance ratings. This is after accounting for the control variable and the independent variables. From a cultural standpoint, the findings in this study underscore that conversations based on the Malaysian cultural norm of ¡° budi ¡± reflect not only a cultural basis of communication, but also that this shared cultural context leads to perceived similarity between ethnic Malay, Chinese, and Indians, and also both genders in the Malaysian workplace. Research limitations/implications Leader-member dyadic communication agreement reflects the social appropriateness and relationship quality between individuals, as well as the context of the leader-member workgroup interactions. The findings of this study underscore the premise that conversations reflect not only a cultural basis of communication, but also that shared cultural context leads to perceived similarity.

Managing intergenerational relationships among teaching staff at higher education institutions necessitates, among other efforts, a critical review of communication processes. However, few studies have explored the implications of generational diversity for organisational communication, particularly in university settings. This study aimed to examine intergenerational communication in the workplace among teaching staff at Spanish public universities. The Workplace Intergenerational Climate Scale questionnaire was administered to 1,751 Spanish academics. The findings reveal that teaching staff exhibit certain age©\related stereotypes that influence communication. When intergenerational communication is perceived as effective, it tends to focus predominantly on academic tasks. Age©\related differences and associated beliefs significantly influence the quality, quantity and nature of intergenerational interactions.

High purity silica can be produced by controlled combustion after acid treatment. In this study, leaching of rice husk with hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid were carried out prior to combustion to obtain purer silica. It was found that pre-treatment of the rice husk with sulfuric acid had accelerated the hydrolysis and decomposition of organic components as revealed by thermogravimetry (TG) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses. In a systematic study, the combustion of un-leached, hydrochloric acid-leached and sulfuric acid-leached rice husks were performed in a muffle furnace at 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900oC for 2 h. Results demonstrated that all the samples produced amorphous silica (SiO2) and the average particle size were in the range of 0.50 to 0.70 ¦Ìm. The effect of combustion at different temperatures between 500oC and 900oC on the silica production is very small, particularly at temperature above 600oC. Thus, amorphous silica with purity above 99% as confirmed by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis can be produced by hydrochloric and sulfuric acids leaching of the rice husk, followed by controlled combustion at 600oC for 2 h.

Against the backdrop of rapid technological advancement and societal structural transformation, old age has increasingly been associated with negative meanings, especially in so-called Eastern countries, where the tradition of respect for older adults has been eroding. Under such circumstances, younger adults are likely to struggle and be dissatisfied in their communication with older adults, who consider communication with the latter to be rather problematic. Turning to the workplace, which has more recently garnered scholastic attention from intergenerational scholars, older adults tend to suffer from negative age stereotypes and discrimination in this context too.

Design/methodology/approach A trade©\theoretic model of two open economies which are in conflict with each other was constructed. War efforts, which involve the use of soldiers and arms, are determined endogenously. The purpose of war is the capture of land containing a natural resource like diamond, but the costs are that lives are lost and production sacrificed. The capture of mining land helps to reinforce the war by using profits from the sale of the natural resource to purchase arms. Findings The paper identifies the role of the ¡°protective¡± nature of arms, and of income effects of the policy instruments, on the results. For example, foreign aid is found, unambiguously, to increase war when the entire profit from the sale of blood diamond is used to buy arms. But, when the proportion of profits from blood diamond used to buy arms is chosen optimally, foreign aid increases war efforts when arms are significantly protective of soldiers' lives.

Psychological Bulletin , 141(3): 694-722.",2015,Compensatory control and the appeal of a structured world,"People are motivated to perceive themselves as having control over their lives. Consequently, they respond to events and cognitions that reduce control with compensatory strategies for restoring perceived control to baseline levels. Prior theory and research have documented 3 such strategies: bolstering personal agency, affiliating with external systems perceived to be acting on the self's behalf, and affirming clear contingencies between actions and outcomes within the context of reduced control (here termed specific structure). We propose a 4th strategy: affirming nonspecific structure, or seeking out and preferring simple, clear, and consistent interpretations of the social and physical environments. Formulating this claim suggests that people will respond to reduced control by affirming structured interpretations that are unrelated to the control-reducing condition, and even those that entail otherwise adverse outcomes (e.g., pessimistic health prospects). Section 1 lays the conceptual foundation for our review, situating the proposed phenomenon in the literatures on control motivation and threat-compensation mechanisms. Section 2 reviews studies that have demonstrated that trait and state variations in perceived control predict a wide range of epistemic structuring tendencies, including pattern recognition and causal reasoning. We posit that these tendencies reflect a common desire for a structured understanding of one's environment. Accordingly, a new meta-analysis spanning the reviewed studies (k = 55) revealed that control reduction predicts nonspecific structure affirmation with a moderate effect size (r = .25). Section 3 reviews research on individual differences and situational moderators of this effect. The discussion addresses the interplay of compensatory control strategies and practical implications.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,10.1037/a0038703,https://openalex.org/W1980775666,2015,Psychological Bulletin,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-biblio:Landau, M., Kay, A.

Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies.

Current Opinion in Psychology .",2018,The self over time,"Diachronic unity is the belief that, despite changes, we are the same person across the lifespan. We propose that diachronic unity is supported by the experience of remembering the self over time during episodic recall (i.e., phenomenological continuity). However, we also predict that diachronic unity is also possible when episodic memory is impaired, as long as the ability to construct life narratives from semantic memory (i.e., semantic continuity) is intact. To examine this prediction, we investigated diachronic unity in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), two conditions characterised by disrupted phenomenological continuity. If semantic continuity is also altered in these conditions, there should be an associated deterioration in diachronic unity. Participants with AD, aMCI, and healthy controls (HC) completed a self-persistence interview measuring diachronic unity (beliefs about self-persistence, explanations for stability/change). Semantic continuity was assessed with a life-story interview measuring autobiographical reasoning (self-event connections), and coherence (temporal/thematic/causal) of narratives. Our results highlight a complex relationship between semantic continuity and diachronic unity and revealed a divergence between two aspects of diachronic unity: AD/aMCI groups did not differ from HC in continuity beliefs, but AD explanations for self-persistence were less sophisticated. Semantic continuity was most impaired in AD: their narratives had fewer self-event connections (vs. HCs) and lower temporal/thematic coherence (vs. HC/aMCI), while both AD/aMCI groups had lower causal coherence. Paradoxically AD participants who scored higher on measures of beliefs in the persistence of the core self, provided less sophisticated explanations for their self-persistence and were less able to explore persistence in their life narratives. These findings support the importance of semantic continuity to diachronic unity, but suggest a more nuanced and multifaceted relationship than originally proposed in our model. In AD, diminished life narratives that retain features of cultural life scripts are sufficient for strong subjective beliefs of self-persistence, but not for sophisticated explanations about persistence. Better semantic continuity, with the ability to weave high-quality life narratives, may scaffold the capacity to understand and explain one's diachronic unity, but this produces less surety about self-persistence.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.06.004,https://openalex.org/W2793839217,2019,Current Opinion in Psychology,no_abstract_from_cr,"CR-biblio:Hershfield, H.

This study examines the effect of financial literacy programs on household saving behavior in urban Indonesia, employing a quasi-experimental mixed-methods design. Data were collected from 150 households through pre- and post-program surveys, complemented by in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Quantitative results show significant increases in household savings across all income groups, with lower-income households exhibiting the highest proportional gains (+60%). Middle- and higher-income households also demonstrated notable improvements, though with smaller relative increases. Qualitative findings reveal that participants gained greater awareness of budgeting, savings options, and financial decision-making, while persistent challenges, such as limited access to formal financial services, constrained the full application of knowledge. The study also finds that both male- and female-headed households benefited from the program, and younger participants showed higher adaptability to new saving practices. Overall, the findings suggest that financial literacy programs effectively enhance household saving behavior, increase financial confidence, and contribute to broader social objectives such as gender equity and family welfare. However, to sustain and maximize these benefits, complementary interventions such as accessible financial services, targeted incentives, and supportive policy frameworks are necessary.

Two particularly important aspects of that relationship are the extent to which positive and negative affect are correlated with one another and the extent to which they co-occur. Some researchers have assumed that weak negative correlations imply greater co-occurrence (i.e., more mixed emotions) than do strong negative correlations, but others have noted that correlations may imply very little about co-occurrence. We investigated the relationship between the correlation between positive and negative affect and co-occurrence. Participants in each of 2 samples provided moment-to-moment happiness and sadness ratings as they watched an evocative film and listened to music. Results indicated (a) that 4 measures of the correlation between positive and negative affect were quite highly related to 1 another; (b) that the strength of the correlation between measures of mixed emotions varied considerably; (c) that correlational measures were generally (but not always) weakly correlated with mixed emotion measures; and (d) that bittersweet stimuli consistently led to elevations in mixed emotion measures but did not consistently weaken the correlation between positive and negative affect. Results highlight that the correlation between positive and negative affect and their co-occurrence are distinct aspects of the relationship between positive and negative affect. Such insight helps clarify the implications of existing work on age-related and cultural differences in emotional experience and sets the stage for greater understanding of the experience of mixed emotions.

In this work, we introduce model-based prediction with self-supervised visual correspondence learning, and show that not only is this indeed possible, but demonstrate that these types of predictive models show compelling performance improvements over alternative methods for vision-based RL with autoencoder-type vision training.

This motivates the studies on group recommendation, which aims to recommend items for a group of users. Group recommendation is a challenging problem because different group members have different preferences, and how to make a trade-off among their preferences for recommendation is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model named COM (COnsensus Model) to model the generative process of group activities, and make group recommendations. Intuitively, users in a group may have different influences, and those who are expert in topics relevant to the group are usually more influential. In addition, users in a group may behave differently as group members from as individuals. COM is designed based on these intuitions, and is able to incorporate both users' selection history and personal considerations of content factors. When making recommendations, COM estimates the preference of a group to an item by aggregating the preferences of the group members with different weights.

These programs provide discounts and perks to loyal customers and are costly to administer, but produce uncertain changes in spending patterns.

We combine this with detailed spatial data on customer and store locations, including the locations of competing firms. We find significant changes in behavior associated with joining the LP with a large amount of heterogeneity across customers. We find that location relative to competitors is the factor most strongly associated with increases in spending following joining the LP, suggesting that the LP&#8217;s quantity discounts work primarily through business stealing and not through other demand expansion. We next estimate a model of what variables determine how spending will change after joining the LP. We use high-dimensional data on spatial relationships between customers, the focal firm&#8217;s stores, and competing stores as well as customers&#8217; historical spending patterns. This model is used to test whether past sales data reflecting customer&#8217;s vertical value to the firm or spatial data reflecting customer&#8217;s horizontal vulnerability are more important determinants of post-LP spending increases.

We use this data to assess the costs and benefits of fake reviews to sellers and evaluate the degree to which they harm consumers. The theoretical literature on review fraud shows conditions when they harm consumers and conditions where they function as simply another type of advertising. Using detailed data on product outcomes before and after they buy fake reviews we can directly determine if these are low-quality products using fake reviews to deceive and harm consumers or if they are high-quality products that solicit reviews to establish reputations. We find that a wide array of products purchase fake reviews, including products with many reviews and high average ratings. Buying fake reviews on Facebook leads to a significant increase in average rating and sales rank, but the effect disappears after roughly one month. After firms stop buying fake reviews their average ratings fall significantly and the share of one-star reviews increases significantly, indicating fake reviews are mostly used by low quality products and are deceiving and harming consumers.

In this study, the influence of structured PM methodologies like Agile, Scrum, Waterfall and Hybrid on digital marketing analytics for startup success in marketing efficiency, customer engagement and business scalability will be examined. The design choice was a quantitative one with survey data from 200 professionals at US based startups (founders, project managers, digital marketing managers, data analysts among others). The findings show that startups utilizing structured PM frameworks achieve much greater digital marketing performance. The results of regression analysis revealed that digital analytics use (¦Â = 0.55, p &lt; 0.001) was the strongest influencer of marketing effectiveness and the adoption of omnichannel (¦Â = 0.45, p = 0.001) was the key predictor of sustained startup growth. Logistic regression analysis shows that startups implementing PM strategies have 2.15 times a higher chance to reach marketing success. The study reveals some key challenges of less entrenched adoption of PM frameworks such as a budget constraint, lack of skilled personnel and resistance to digital transformation that still prevent the full-scale adoption of PM frameworks in marketing strategy execution. The findings of the study are of critical importance to U.S. startups in the areas of data driven decision-making, real-time marketing analytics and PM methodologies to gain marketing ROI, customer retention and competitive advantage. The conclusion of this research is that utilizing project management principles in coordination with digital marketing analytics will lead to long term business sustainability in U.S. startup landscape. This research is to be further explored by future research into AI driven marketing automation and the application of such emerging technologies to increase project management efficiency.

But is having limited discretionary time actually detrimental? And can there be downsides of having too much discretionary time? In two large-scale data sets spanning 35,375 Americans and two experiments, we explore the relationship between the amount of discretionary time individuals have and their subjective well-being. We find and internally replicate a negative quadratic relationship between discretionary time and subjective well-being. These results show that whereas having too little time is indeed linked to lower subjective well-being caused by stress, having more time does not continually translate to greater subjective well-being. Having an abundance of discretionary time is sometimes even linked to lower subjective well-being because of a lacking sense of productivity. In such cases, the negative effect of having too much discretionary time can be attenuated when people spend this time on productive activities.

However, the current accounting system developed a long time ago doesn't include the measurement of happiness. This paper's contribution and uniqueness are that it identified this significant research gap of the lack of inclusion of happiness in the accounting and other measurement systems and established a case for including happiness in the measurement system. The key takeaway is that happiness matters for the corporates as happiness impacts performance, it is about good corporate citizenship, and it is possible to measure happiness. Corporates need to include happiness in the accounting and other performance measurement systems. The implication is to take happiness more seriously as it impacts performance, helps in brand building and reputation, and also is the right thing to do as a good corporate practitioner. More research is needed for creating accounting solutions and systems for including happiness in accounting. Also, there is an urgent need to create a consensus among accounting and measurement professionals on including happiness in the measurement systems.

Meetings are increasingly used by companies as a collaboration tool, but can satisfy deeper human drives for involvement, approval, and control rather than just productivity. However, over-reliance on frequent and back-to-back meetings takes a psychological toll by disrupting focus, activating stress responses, and reducing autonomy. Though intended to increase productivity, excessive scheduling often backfires as overstressed employees are less effective. The article recommends guidelines for purposeful meetings, empowering employees to consider alternatives, limiting back-to-backs, using timeboxes and clear agendas, and fostering well-being.

Eight studies examine how the variety among the activities that fill people¡¯s day-to-day lives affects subsequent happiness. The studies demonstrate that whether variety increases or decreases happiness depends on the perceived duration of the time within which the activities occur. For longer time periods (like a day), variety does increase happiness. However, for shorter time periods (like an hour), variety instead decreases happiness. This reversal stems from people¡¯s sense of stimulation and productivity during that time. Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness).

J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1896¨C1911, 2023¡ªIn the last decade, monitoring physiological and match-related demands in soccer has become an increasingly common practice in sports sciences. One of the great challenges during monitoring process is the identification of key indicators that permit to generalize evidence and sustain decision-making process during training prescription. Actually, one of the major debates in the scientific community and among practitioners is the identification of the ¡°intensity¡± concept. Defining a given training session or exercise based on ¡°intensity¡± is difficult due to the fact that a huge amount of indicators are available (related both to the performed activities and to the athletes' psychophysiological responses). These indicators can lead to specific outcomes with different interpretations. The current narrative review aims to discuss the different measures approaches used in soccer to describe the intensity for both internal and external demands. In addition, a second purpose of this review is to propose general recommendations for combining intensity indicators with the aim of defining an overall intensity score of a training session or drill.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4386130373,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:P.

Behavioral Science & Policy.",2017,Policy Applications of Behavioral Insights to Household Financial Decision Making,"Financial literacy programs have emerged as critical interventions to enhance household financial capability and promote responsible saving behavior, particularly in urban contexts with diverse socio-economic conditions. This study examines the effect of financial literacy programs on household saving behavior in urban Indonesia, employing a quasi-experimental mixed-methods design. Data were collected from 150 households through pre- and post-program surveys, complemented by in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Quantitative results show significant increases in household savings across all income groups, with lower-income households exhibiting the highest proportional gains (+60%). Middle- and higher-income households also demonstrated notable improvements, though with smaller relative increases. Qualitative findings reveal that participants gained greater awareness of budgeting, savings options, and financial decision-making, while persistent challenges, such as limited access to formal financial services, constrained the full application of knowledge. The study also finds that both male- and female-headed households benefited from the program, and younger participants showed higher adaptability to new saving practices. Overall, the findings suggest that financial literacy programs effectively enhance household saving behavior, increase financial confidence, and contribute to broader social objectives such as gender equity and family welfare. However, to sustain and maximize these benefits, complementary interventions such as accessible financial services, targeted incentives, and supportive policy frameworks are necessary. These insights provide important implications for policymakers, program designers, and financial institutions aiming to strengthen financial inclusion and household economic resilience in urban Indonesia.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W7105986635,,,no_abstract_all_sources,CR-biblio:Madrian 2017 Policy Applications of Behavioral Insights to Household Financial Decision Making,,,,Goal 11,0.100235159,TRUE,urban resilience

Se han realizado grandes esfuerzos para identificar cu¨¢les son las variables que pueden influenciar esta relaci¨®n. En este sentido, esa es la pregunta central que ha motivado el presente trabajo. Por qu¨¦ a pesar de tener evidencia de que la diversificaci¨®n destruye el valor de las empresas, en la actualidad cada vez son m¨¢s las compa?¨ªas que optan por llevar a cabo esta estrategia. En orden de encontrar respuesta a estos comportamientos, es necesario pues, profundizar en el estudio de variables modeladoras que contribuyan a contextualizar el efecto de la diversificaci¨®n. En concreto, se han estudiado las oportunidades de crecimiento y el ciclo de vida organizacional. Cada una de estas variables ha sido objeto de innumerables estudios, sin embargo se han realizado de forma independiente. El presente trabajo es el primero al incorporar dichas variables conjuntamente en los modelos de diversificaci¨®n corporativa. Adicionalmente, se proporciona evidencia de la influencia de los mecanismos de gobierno interno en la relaci¨®n diversificaci¨®n-valor. Finalmente, se aporta evidencia de uno de los t¨®picos de estudio m¨¢s reciente en el ¨¢rea de gobierno corporativo, el ciclo de vida. En este sentido, se analiza c¨®mo van cambiando la interrelaci¨®n de estos mecanismos conforme la empresa evoluciona en las fases del ciclo de vida. A continuaci¨®n se resumen los objetivos alcanzados en este trabajo. En primer lugar se determinaron las fases del ciclo de vida de las empresas que conformaron la muestra. Los resultados evidencian la existencia de tres fases: crecimiento, estabilidad/madurez y renovaci¨®n/declive. Posteriormente se estudiaron los modelos de diversificaci¨®n de forma global y por cada una de estas fases. Los resultados corroboran que el descuento de diversificaci¨®n puede ser explicado, en parte, por la diferencia en oportunidades de crecimiento entre empresas diversificadas y especializadas. Finalmente, si la diversificaci¨®n es el resultado de comportamientos oportunistas por parte de los directivos se esperar¨ªa que sean solamente descontadas aquellas empresas con estructuras ineficientes de gobierno. Sin embargo, los resultados de los modelos no apoyan esta hip¨®tesis. Con la finalidad de profundizar en dichos resultados integramos al modelo la variable de oportunidades de crecimiento. El efecto de la diversificaci¨®n para las empresas con altas oportunidades de crecimiento y estructuras eficientes de gobierno corporativo es positivo apoyando los argumentos del impacto positivo de las oportunidades de crecimiento en la relaci¨®n entre la estrategia de diversificaci¨®n y el valor de mercado de las empresas. Por el contrario, el efecto de la diversificaci¨®n en el grupo de empresas con bajas oportunidades es siempre negativo y significativo, tanto para las empresas con estructuras de gobierno eficientes como ineficientes. Este fen¨®meno puede atribuirse al hecho de que los mecanismos de gobierno son una respuesta end¨®gena al entorno de negocios y econ¨®mico de las empresas. En s¨ªntesis, cuando las empresas diversificadas est¨¢n conformadas por segmentos con buenas opciones de inversi¨®n tienden a obtener un efecto positivo en su valor de mercado y la influencia de sus mecanismos internos de gobierno es clara",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W1598885774,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:Rivera, Martha and Andres Terech, ¡°KidZania: Estrategia de Diferenciaci¨®n, Crecimiento y Diversificaci¨®n,¡± IPADE, August",,,,Goal 17,0.001733717,FALSE,

IoT applications have gained popularity due to the availability of various IoT enabler gadgets, such as smartwatches, smartphones, and so on. However, the vulnerability of IoT devices has led to security challenges, including Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. These limitations result from the dynamic communication between IoT devices due to their limited data storage and processing resources. The primary research challenge is to create a model that can recognize legitimate traffic while effectively protecting the network against various classes of DDoS attacks. This article proposes a CNN-BiLSTM DDoS detection model by combining three deep-learning algorithms. The models are evaluated using the CICIDS2017 dataset against commonly used performance criteria which the models perform well, achieving an accuracy of around 99.76%, except for the CNN model, which achieves an accuracy of 98.82%.

To determine whether these parameters were significant predictors of the type of hip fracture, we measured 167 healthy women (controls), 24 women with trochanteric, and 42 women with cervical hip fractures within the EPIDOS prospective cohort. EPIDOS is a multicenter prospective study on risk factors for hip fracture performed in 7575 elderly women living at home, aged 75¨C95 and conducted in five French centers (Amiens, Lyon, Montpellier, Paris, Toulouse). Measurements were performed on data acquired at baseline before the occurrence of fracture. In the cervical fracture group, HAL was significantly longer than in controls (94.2 vs. 92.3, p = 0.03), and the associated odds ratio (OR) adjusted for age, weight, and total femoral neck BMD was significant (OR = 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06¨C2.55). In contrast, HAL was not significantly different from controls in the trochanteric fracture group. Femoral neck diameter was not a predictor of fracture. The upper and lower femoral neck BMD was lower in the trochanteric fracture group than in controls, and both measurements predicted trochanteric femoral neck fracture. In contrast, the prediction of cervical femoral neck fracture was enhanced by measuring only the upper part of the femoral neck (OR = 2.79 vs. 1.97 for the total femoral neck) while BMD of the lower part was not different from controls. Hip axis length is a predictor of femoral neck fracture. Femoral neck BMD distribution is different between cervical and trochanteric fractures.

The context is U.S. schools, where we explore how awards motivate student attendance. Contrary to our pre-registered hypotheses and organizational leaders¡¯ expectations, the prospective awards did not on average improve behavior, and the retrospective awards decreased subsequent attendance. Moreover, we find a significant negative effect on attendance after prospective incentives were removed, which points to a crowding-out effect. Survey experiments probing the mechanisms suggest that awards may cause these unintended effects by inadvertently signaling that the target behavior (perfect attendance) is neither the social norm nor institutionally expected. In addition, receiving the retrospective award suggests to recipients that they have already outperformed the norm and what was expected of them, hence licensing them to miss school.

Even so, confusion arises because it can be defined in different ways, e.g., as the sum of producer and consumer surplus in a given time period, or as the change in surplus over time. To formalize the latter notion, we introduce the concept of economic gain, defined as the increase in total surplus. Economic gain can arise through innovation or when a superior firm displaces competitors. We provide a firm©\level measurement framework to quantify economic gain and its distribution among stakeholders, including the firm's shareholders, employees, suppliers, and customers. As an empirical illustration, we compare the creation and distribution of economic gain by Southwest Airlines and American Airlines between 1980 and 2010. Managerial Summary : Most managers and the business press regard ¡°value creation¡± as the increase in shareholder wealth represented by a rise in corporate profit or stock price. A broader conception of value creation goes beyond shareholders to include the value that is distributed to additional stakeholders of the firm, including employees, suppliers, and customers.

We begin by describing several presumed market failures affecting entrepreneurial firms that would lead to an under-provision of entrepreneurial activity: 1) information spillovers from innovations in entrepreneurial firms to other firms, 2) positive externalities to consumers from innovative new products sold by these firms, and 3) lemons problems in the market for both debt and equity issued by these firms. We then analyze the degree to which various tax policy measures can alleviate these failures. A key complication we focus on is the inability of the government to observe which, and the degree to which, any given start-up firm is entrepreneurial. This forces policy to target behavioral differences between entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial start-ups. We presume that start-up firms, to the degree they are entrepreneurial, face upfront costs in developing and marketing a new technology, and in the process face substantial risk. Our analysis then suggests the use of refundable tax savings from business losses in start-ups together with a compensating surtax on the profits of start-ups (needed in the case of lemons problems) to help alleviate the various market failures faced by entrepreneurial start-ups.",SemanticScholar(DOI),0,10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.08.003,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cabee0aa6ed437354f0a24394575e06787b44137,2018,Journal of Public Economics,likely_no_public_abstract,"CR-biblio:  1.

First, we find a modest improvement in credit access when there is counterfactual credit reporting, but no impact on credit report outcomes when there is not.

 We study how inertia interacts with market power and adverse selection in health insurance. We incorporate inertia into a model of plan selection and price competition, and estimate it using data from the California ACA exchange. We estimate inertia costs equaling 26% of average premiums. Our simulations indicate that inertia exacerbates market power, but has minimal interaction with selection. Eliminating inertia reduces average premiums by 6.6%. Maintaining premium-linked subsidies or reducing consumer churn increases the impact of inertia by enhancing market power. Provider network attachment is an important impediment to plan switching, but substantial inertia remains after accounting for networks.",SemanticScholar(DOI),0,10.7551/mitpress/1986.003.0006,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6ada608fa091a70f12d688d2cb652d0ab7e80b34,2006,Competitive Failures in Insurance Markets,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-biblio:Provider Market Power and Adverse Selection in Health Insurance Markets,Adverse Selection in the Health Insurance Market after Genetic Tests,10.7551/mitpress/1986.003.0006,,Goal 3,0.023811657,FALSE,
