(2021) Submitted.",2021,Assortment Optimization under the Decision Forest Model,"The decision forest model is a recently proposed nonparametric choice model that is capable of representing any discrete choice model and in particular, can be used to represent non-rational customer behavior. In this paper, we study the problem of finding the assortment that maximizes expected revenue under the decision forest model. This problem is of practical importance because it allows a firm to tailor its product offerings to profitably exploit deviations from rational customer behavior, but at the same time is challenging due to the extremely general nature of the decision forest model. We approach this problem from a mixed-integer optimization perspective and propose three different formulations. We theoretically compare these formulations in strength, and analyze when these formulations are integral in the special case of a single tree. We propose a methodology for solving these problems at a large-scale based on Benders decomposition, and show that the Benders subproblem can be solved efficiently by primal-dual greedy algorithms when the master solution is fractional for two of our formulations, and in closed form when the master solution is binary for all of our formulations. Using synthetically generated instances, we demonstrate the practical tractability of our formulations and our Benders decomposition approach, and their edge over heuristic approaches.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100,10.2139/ssrn.3812654,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11709401dfd6fc7b7fe6019840060cdb29089d48,2021,Social Science Research Network,ok,"CR-biblio:Assortment Optimization under the Decision Forest Model.

(2021) Forthcoming in Management Science.",2021,Decision Forest: A Nonparametric Approach to Modeling Irrational Choice,"Customer behavior is often assumed to follow weak rationality, which implies that adding a product to an assortment will not increase the choice probability of another product in that assortment. However, an increasing amount of research has revealed that customers are not necessarily rational when making decisions. In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric choice model that relaxes this assumption and can model a wider range of customer behavior, such as decoy effects between products. In this model, each customer type is associated with a binary decision tree, which represents a decision process for making a purchase based on checking for the existence of specific products in the assortment. Together with a probability distribution over customer types, we show that the resulting model—a decision forest—is able to represent any customer choice model, including models that are inconsistent with weak rationality. We theoretically characterize the depth of the forest needed to fit a data set of historical assortments and prove that with high probability, a forest whose depth scales logarithmically in the number of assortments is sufficient to fit most data sets. We also propose two practical algorithms—one based on column generation and one based on random sampling—for estimating such models from data. Using synthetic data and real transaction data exhibiting nonrational behavior, we show that the model outperforms both rational and nonrational benchmark models in out-of-sample predictive ability.

This problem consists of determining the optimal fraction of patients to be screened in every period as well as the optimum staffing level at each part of the healthcare system to maximize the total health benefits to the patients measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. We modeled this problem as a nonlinear mixed integer programming program comprising disease progression (the transition of the patients across health states), system dynamics (the flow of patients in different health states across various parts of the healthcare delivery system), and budgetary and capacity constraints. We applied the model to the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) station in the Veterans Health Administration system. We found that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine screening policy in which all patients visiting the system are screened for HIV irrespective of risk factors may not be feasible because of budgetary constraints. Consequently, we used the model to develop and evaluate managerially relevant policies within existent capacity and budgetary constraints to improve upon the current risk based screening policy of screening only high risk patients. Our computational analysis showed that the GLA station can achieve substantial increase (20% to 300%) in the QALYs gained by using these policies over risk based screening. The GLA station has already adapted two of these policies that could yield better patient health outcomes over the next few years. In addition, our model insights have influenced the decision making process at this station.",Crossref,100,10.1287/opre.2015.1353,https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2015.1353,2015,Operations Research,ok,"CR-biblio:Planning for HIV Screening  Planning for HIV Screening, Testing, and Care at the Veterans Health Administration","Planning for HIV Screening, Testing, and Care at the Veterans Health Administration",10.1287/opre.2015.1353,,Goal 3,0.095014778,TRUE,HIV treatment

Major revision, Management Science.",,"Planning Bike Lanes with Data: Ridership, Congestion, and Path Selection, with Sheng Liu and Jingwei Zhang","Urban infrastructure is vital for sustainable cities. In recent years, municipal governments have invested heavily in the expansion of bike lane networks to meet growing demand, promote ridership, and reduce emissions. However, reallocating road capacity to cycling is often contentious because of the risk of amplifying traffic congestion. In this paper, we develop a method for planning bike lanes that accounts for ridership and congestion effects. We first present a procedure for estimating parameters of a traffic equilibrium model, which combines an inverse optimization method for predicting driving times with an instrumental variables method for estimating a commuter mode choice model. We then formulate a prescriptive model that selects paths in a road network for bike lane installation while endogenizing cycling demand and driving travel times. We conduct an empirical study on the City of Chicago that brings together several data sets that describe the urban environment—including the road and bike lane networks, vehicle flows, commuter mode choices, bike share trips, driving and cycling routes, demographic features, and points of interest—with the goal of estimating the impact of expanding Chicago’s bike lane network. We estimate that adding 25 miles of bike lanes as prescribed by our model can lift cycling ridership from 3.6% to 6.1%, with at most a 9.4% increase in driving times. We also find that three intuitive heuristics for bike lane planning can lead to lower ridership and worse congestion outcomes, highlighting the value of a holistic and data-driven approach to urban infrastructure planning.

In recent decades, those have been considered as possibilities to pretreat recalcitrant wood lignocellulosics for the enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides and the subsequent fermentation of obtained sugars to valuable bioproducts. Current work compares chemistry and technological features of two different cooking processes in the preparation of polysaccharide substrates for deep saccharification with P. verruculosum glycosyl hydrolases. Bleached kraft and sulfite pulps were subjected to hydrolysis with enzyme mixture of high xylanase, cellobiohydrolase, and β-glucosidase activities at a dosage of 10 FPU/g of dry pulp and fiber concentration of 2.5, 5, and 10%. HPLC was used to analyze soluble sugars after hydrolysis and additional acid inversion of oligomers to monosaccharides. Kraft pulp demonstrated higher pulp conversion after 48 h (74–99%), which mostly resulted from deep xylan hydrolysis. Sulfite-pulp hydrolysates, obtained in similar conditions due to higher hexose concentration (more than 50 g/L), had higher fermentability for industrial strains producing alcohols, microbial protein, or organic acids. Along with saccharification, enzymatic modification of non-hydrolyzed residues occurred, which led to decreased degree of polymerization and composition changes in two industrial pulps.

In cold cores and in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks, gas-phase water comes from photodesorption of water ice. We present fitting formulae for implementation in astrochemical models using photodesorption efficiencies for all water ice isotopologues obtained using classical molecular dynamics simulations. We investigate if the gas-phase HDO/H2O ratio reflects that present in the ice or whether fractionation can occur during photodesorption. Probabilities for the top four monolayers are presented for photodesorption of X (X=H,D) atoms, OX radicals, and X2O and HDO molecules following photodissociation of H2O, D2O, and HDO in H2O amorphous ice at temperatures from 10-100 K. Isotope effects are found for all products: (1) H atom photodesorption probabilities from H2O ice are larger than those for D atom photodesorption from D2O ice by a factor of 1.1; the ratio of H and D photodesorbed upon HDO photodissociation is a factor of 2. This process will enrich the ice in deuterium atoms over time; (2) the OD/OH photodesorption ratio upon D2O and H2O photodissociation is on average a factor of 2, but the ratio upon HDO photodissociation is almost constant at unity for all temperatures; (3) D atoms are more effective in kicking out neighbouring water molecules than H atoms. However, the ratio of the photodesorbed HDO and H2O molecules is equal to the HDO/H2O ratio in the ice, therefore, there is no isotope fractionation upon HDO and H2O photodesorption. Nevertheless, the enrichment of the ice in D atoms due to photodesorption can over time lead to an enhanced HDO/H2O ratio in the ice, and, when photodesorbed, also in the gas. The extent to which the ortho/para ratio of H2O can be modified by the photodesorption process is also discussed.

In order to propose suitable solutions to administrate exchange rate policy effectively, this article employs the VAR model, in which the relationship between exchange rate and three objectives of exchange rate policy (including prices, output and trade balance) are tested. The data used in this model is quarterly, in the period 2001q1-2017q3. Based on the results of the VAR model, a number of policy implications has been proposed, including: (i) continuing to apply currency basket pegged exchange rate regime; (ii) in stead of choosing to devaluate VND, the SBV should use other exchange rate management tools; (iii) speeding up the development of derivative exchange rate market is necessary to reduce the level of ERPT to the import price index so that helps to control inflation in Vietnam and (iv) the SBV should prioritize the exchange rate policy administration towards price stability through adopting the inflation-targeting monetary policy.

This review synthesizes findings from sociology, social psychology, and economics to explore the significance of these shocks, how the period in which they are experienced matters, and their lasting effects. It examines economic shocks such as recessions, inflation, and trade shocks, alongside noneconomic shocks like migrations, wars, terrorist attacks, pandemics, and natural disasters. Key conclusions emerge: aggregate shocks influence political preferences, risk attitudes, and institutional trust; experiences during young adulthood have stronger, enduring impacts; and economic shocks generally shift preferences toward the political right, while noneconomic yield more varied outcomes depending on the context. The review also evaluates empirical methodologies, their limitations, and mechanisms underlying these effects. By analyzing how shocks alter societal values and behaviors across generations, this work provides insights into the long-term consequences of major disruptions on individual and collective decision-making.

Effective strategies are needed to curtail overuse that may lead to harm.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effects of clinician decision support redirecting attention to harms and engaging social and reputational concerns on overuse in older primary care patients.


DESIGN
18-month, single-blind, pragmatic, cluster randomized trial, constrained randomization. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04289753).


SETTING
60 primary care internal medicine, family medicine and geriatrics practices within a health system from 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2022.


PARTICIPANTS
371 primary care clinicians and their older adult patients from participating practices.


INTERVENTION
Behavioral science-informed, point-of-care, clinical decision support tools plus brief case-based education addressing the 3 primary clinical outcomes (187 clinicians from 30 clinics) were compared with brief case-based education alone (187 clinicians from 30 clinics). Decision support was designed to increase salience of potential harms, convey social norms, and promote accountability.


MEASUREMENTS
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men aged 76 years and older without previous prostate cancer, urine testing for nonspecific reasons in women aged 65 years and older, and overtreatment of diabetes with hypoglycemic agents in patients aged 75 years and older and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 7%.


RESULTS
At randomization, mean clinic annual PSA testing, unspecified urine testing, and diabetes overtreatment rates were 24.9, 23.9, and 16.8 per 100 patients, respectively. After 18 months of intervention, the intervention group had lower adjusted difference-in-differences in annual rates of PSA testing (-8.7 [95% CI, -10.2 to -7.1]), unspecified urine testing (-5.5 [CI, -7.0 to -3.6]), and diabetes overtreatment (-1.4 [CI, -2.9 to -0.03]) compared with education only. Safety measures did not show increased emergency care related to urinary tract infections or hyperglycemia. An HbA1c greater than 9.0% was more common with the intervention among previously overtreated diabetes patients (adjusted difference-in-differences, 0.47 per 100 patients [95% CI, 0.04 to 1.20]).


LIMITATION
A single health system limits generalizability; electronic health data limit ability to differentiate between overtesting and underdocumentation.


CONCLUSION
Decision support designed to increase clinicians' attention to possible harms, social norms, and reputational concerns reduced unspecified testing compared with offering traditional case-based education alone. Small decreases in diabetes overtreatment may also result in higher rates of uncontrolled diabetes.

We relied on our collective experience, an extensive body of literature about community health workers (CHWs), and the other papers in this supplement to identify the most pressing challenges facing CHW programmes and approaches for strengthening CHW programmes. CHWs are increasingly being recognized as a critical resource for achieving national and global health goals. These goals include achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals of Universal Health Coverage, ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and making a major contribution to the control of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and noncommunicable diseases. CHWs can also play a critical role in responding to current and future pandemics. For these reasons, we argue that CHWs are now at the dawn of a new era. While CHW programmes have long been an underfunded afterthought, they are now front and centre as the emerging foundation of health systems. Despite this increased attention, CHW programmes continue to face the same pressing challenges: inadequate financing, lack of supplies and commodities, low compensation of CHWs, and inadequate supervision. We outline approaches for strengthening CHW programmes, arguing that their enormous potential will only be realized when investment and health system support matches rhetoric. Rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and implementation research are also needed to enable CHW programmes to continuously improve their quality and effectiveness. A marked increase in sustainable funding for CHW programmes is needed, and this will require increased domestic political support for prioritizing CHW programmes as economies grow and additional health-related funding becomes available.

One that has received little attention is the meaning that people give to the act of spending. Spending money might imply that someone is relatively wealthy—since they have money to spend—or relatively poor—since spending can deplete assets. We show that people differ in the extent to which they believe that spending implies wealth (SIW beliefs). We develop a scale to measure these beliefs and find that people who more strongly believe that SIW spend their own money relatively lavishly and are, on average, more financially vulnerable. We find correlational evidence for these relationships using objective financial-transaction data, including over 2 million transaction records from the bank accounts of over 2,000 users of a money management app, as well as self-reported financial well-being. We also find experimental evidence by manipulating SIW beliefs and observing causal effects on spending intentions.

We further found that the extent to which consumers mentally label a given debt type as ""debt"" drives the emotional consequences of those debt holdings, and compared to the other debt types, student loans are perceived more as ""debt.""

UCLA Anderson Blog.,2020,Staying Happy in Unhappy Times,"A happy and healthy workforce delivers better care. That’s the theory, although the evidence may be elusive. We do know, however, that an unhappy and unwell workforce delivers worse care. The pressures on the workforce are myriad and complex, but with COVID-19 cases rising, at the time of writing, we hear only of problems unsolved and neglect unacknowledged. The workforce crisis is political in the sense that the politicians of the day must address it, and if they do not then their motives and decisions are questioned. Whether other governments would do a better job on the health workforce is unknown, but what is known is that the record of the current UK government is a bad one. Therefore, the workforce becomes political and doctors and other health professionals, when pitted against the government, are easily depicted as radicals. One driver for the crisis in workforce wellbeing and retention, however, seems closer to the heart of the problem. In recent weeks, as international conferences have resumed, I’ve heard health professionals from many countries talk openly about the harm being caused by moral distress, the negative impact on health professionals of their inability to offer a minimum standard of care to patients. Moral distress is a universal phenomenon, and it needs to be more widely acknowledged and addressed. Yet the distress being felt by health professionals has many dimensions. For instance, there is the effect of demonstrable bias in appointment of consultants. It might manifest as a failure to stay updated on how to manage health professionals potentially exposed to HIV. Or reveal itself in battles with technological solutions that overpromise and underdeliver. It may arise from difficulties in helping patients in primary care take up lifestyle interventions. And is certainly exposed by the limited options to support patients with long covid. When we find ourselves in times of trouble, one way out of the distress is to begin with the data. Over the past decade, we’ve seen the growth and helpful impact of a sophisticated methodology called network meta-analysis. Read the story of how network meta-analysis originated, how it works, and how it should be used. Data can be political too, whether they are about moral distress, workforce, racism, technology, or COVID-19, but at least they form the basis of a constructive dialogue and debate.",Semantic Scholar,30.98591549,10.1177/01410768221115275,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f864461a583f7dd50e3afabe16833cd2cf6eaf0f,2022,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,ok,CR-biblio:Cassie Mogilner Holmes (2020).

Separately, recent research suggests a relationship between time poverty and college outcomes for student parents and online students. However, to date, no studies have empirically explored whether differential access to time as a resource for college may explain differential outcomes by gender or race/ethnicity. To address this, this study explored the relationship between time poverty, gender or race/ethnicity, and college outcomes at a large urban public university with two and four year campuses. Time poverty explained a significant proportion of differential outcomes (retention and credit accumulation) by gender and race/ethnicity. More time-poor groups also dedicated a larger proportion of their (relatively limited) discretionary time to their education, suggesting that inequitable distributions of time may contribute to other negative outcomes (e.g., reduced time for sleep, exercise, healthcare). This suggests that time poverty is a significant but understudied equity issue in higher education.",Semantic Scholar,100,10.1177/23328584241237971,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ee10d726521860d2a2f8d8d01563e30d58978b82,2024,AERA Open,ok,CR-biblio:Time Poverty.,,10.1177/23328584241237971,,Goal 4,0.073636212,TRUE,affordable higher education; education disparity; gender disparities

Against this backdrop, policy makers and researchers have looked to drug repurposing-using a drug previously approved for one indication to target a new indication-as a means to accelerate the identification and development of COVID-19 treatments. Using detailed data on US clinical trials initiated during the pandemic, we examined the trajectory and sources of drug repurposing initiatives for COVID-19. We found a rapid increase in repurposing efforts at the start of the pandemic, followed by a transition to greater de novo drug development. The drugs tested for repurposing treat a wide range of indications but were typically initially approved for other infectious diseases.

Whether gender differences in self presentation of clinical research exist and may contribute to this gender gap has been challenging to explore empirically. The objective of this study was to analyze whether men and women differ in how positively they frame their research findings and to analyze whether the positive framing of research is associated with higher downstream citations. Design Retrospective observational study. Data sources Titles and abstracts from 101 720 clinical research articles and approximately 6.2 million general life science articles indexed in PubMed and published between 2002 and 2017. Main outcome measures Analysis of article titles and abstracts to determine whether men and women differ in how positively they present their research through use of terms such as “novel” or “excellent.” For a set of 25 positive terms, we estimated the relative probability of positive framing as a function of the gender composition of the first and last authors, adjusting for scientific journal, year of publication, journal impact, and scientific field. Results Articles in which both the first and last author were women used at least one of the 25 positive terms in 10.9% of titles or abstracts versus 12.2% for articles involving a male first or last author, corresponding to a 12.3% relative difference (95% CI 5.7% to 18.9%). Gender differences in positive presentation were greatest in high impact clinical journals (impact factor >10), in which women were 21.4% less likely to present research positively. Across all clinical journals, positive presentation was associated with 9.4% (6.6% to 12.2%) higher subsequent citations, and in high impact clinical journals 13.0% (9.5% to 16.5%) higher citations. Results were similar when broadened to general life science articles published in journals indexed by PubMed, suggesting that gender differences in positive word use generalize to broader samples. Conclusions Clinical articles involving a male first or last author were more likely to present research findings positively in titles and abstracts compared with articles in which both the first and last author were women, particularly in the highest impact journals.

California sought to address both priorities simultaneously through Senate Bill (SB) 1383, a novel organic waste law. This article contributes to the literature on food loss and waste (FLW) mitigation by examining tensions between SB 1383’s dual goals: diverting organic waste from landfills and redistributing surplus food to communities in need. While SB 1383 is a progressive policy, its implementation has revealed conflicts between these objectives. We assess the impact of SB 1383 on stakeholder compliance with its food waste reduction and recovery requirements. Specifically, we examine the two key objectives of this regulation: (1) mitigating climate change by diverting organic waste from landfills, and (2) addressing food insecurity by redistributing recovered food to communities in need. We interviewed 37 stakeholders, including food recovery organizations, jurisdiction representatives, and edible food generators involved in implementation. Additionally, we analyzed the distribution of Local Assistance Grant funds across California counties and between the policy’s dual goals. Our findings indicate a stronger focus on waste diversion than food recovery, and an uneven distribution of funding, with rural areas facing greater challenges in adapting to SB 1383’s requirements.

Specifically, we investigate whether water scarcity, which results from environmental conditions, influences manufacturing firms to lower their toxic releases to the environment. We created a data set that spans 2000–2016 and includes details on the toxic emissions of 3,092 manufacturing facilities in Texas. Additionally, our data set includes measures of the water scarcity experienced by these facilities. Our econometric analysis shows that manufacturing facilities reduce their toxic releases into the environment when they have experienced drought conditions in the previous year. We examine facilities that release toxics to water as well as facilities with no toxic releases to water. We find that the reduction in total releases (to all media) is driven mainly by those facilities that release toxic chemicals to water. Further investigation at a more granular level indicates that water scarcity compels manufacturing facilities to lower their toxic releases into media other than water (i.e., land or air). The impact of water scarcity on toxic releases to water is more nuanced. A full-sample analysis fails to link water scarcity to lower toxic releases to water, but a further breakdown shows that manufacturing facilities in counties with a higher incidence of drought do lower their toxic releases to water.

Current basic knowledge of K in soils and plant physiology and nutrition is discussed which is followed by sections dealing specifically with future needs for basic and applied research on K in soils, plants, crop nutrition and human and animal nutrition. The section on soils is devoted mainly to the concept of K availability. The current almost universal use of exchangeable K measurements obtained by chemical extraction of dried soil for making fertilizer recommendations is questioned in view of other dominant controlling factors which influence K acquisition from soils by plants. The need to take account of the living root which determines spatial K availability is emphasized. Modelling of K acquisition by field crops is discussed. The part played by K in most plant physiological processes is now well understood including the important role of K in retranslocation of photoassimilates needed for good crop quality. However, basic research is still needed to establish the role of K from molecular level to field management in plant stress situations in which K either acts alone or in combination with specific micronutrients. The emerging role of K in a number of biotic and abiotic stress situations is discussed including those of diseases and pests, frost, heat/drought, and salinity. Breeding crops which are highly efficient in uptake and internal use of K can be counterproductive because of the high demand for K needed to mitigate stress situations in farmers&#8217; fields. The same is true for the need of high K contents in human and animal diets where a high K/Na ratio is desirable. The application of these research findings to practical agriculture is of great importance. The very rapid progress which is being made in elucidating the role of K particularly in relation to stress signalling by use of modern molecular biological approaches is indicative of the need for more interaction between molecular biologists and agronomists for the benefit of agricultural practice. The huge existing body of scientific knowledge of practical value of K in soils and plants presents a major challenge to improving the dissemination of this information on a global scale for use of farmers.

The Review of Financial Studies 30(2), 2017, pp. 505-535 ( Online Appendix )",2016,“ Asset Pricing when 'This Time is Different '” January 2016,"In the mainstream economics there is assumed that all individuals maximizing their selfish goals contribute to maximizing social welfare. At the company level, this objective is formulated as maximizing shareholder value. This mechanism works, if there are no externalities, which can be said to occur when the actions of one entity cause costs or benefits to another economic entity and there is no compensation for the effects of that action. This leads to a sub-optimal allocation of resources and, as a result, maximum social welfare is not achieved. An example of externalities is greenhouse gas emissions, which are linked to global warming. According to a special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)1, a 1.5˚C increase in global warming will make extreme weather events more frequent and more widespread in their effects. Natural resources, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security &amp;ndash; in a word, civilization &amp;ndash; will suffer (IPCC, 2018). However, global warming is not the only challenge of contemporary society. Unemployment, world hunger, inequality in general, armed conflicts or pandemics are all constraints on efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In the hierarchy of human needs, satisfying hunger is more important than breathing clean air or protecting the climate. Introducing regulations that will result in numerous company bankruptcies and mass redundancies will not find social acceptance. The market mechanism must be corrected and pressure put on businesses to take action to reduce emissions. However, this incentive must not be destructive to the economy. In addition, each country has different resources, is at a different level of economic development and, as a result, has different opportunities to reduce emissions. International cooperation is therefore essential. As de Schoutheete suggests, this can be compared to managing interdependence. For in the reality of political life we are dealing with a complex system of functional management of socio-economic interdependencies involving groups, communities, regions and nations in search of meaning and purpose (de Schoutheete, 1997, p. 149). The best example of international cooperation on climate protection is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter UNFCCC or Climate Convention). In the framework of the Climate Convention, parties declare and negotiate emission reduction commitments, which are then attached as protocols or contributions to a binding agreement. Both the European Union (EU) and its individual members are parties to the UNFCCC. The European Emissions Trading Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the EU ETS) is the main tool for implementing the commitments undertaken by the EU and its members in the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC. The system was established on 13 October 2003 (Directive 2003/87/EC) and became operational in January 2005. It covers about 45% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The EU&amp;rsquo;s target under the EU ETS was to achieve emissions 21% lower than in 2005 by 2020. The post-2020 assumptions were revised in July 2015. It was determined that the sectors covered by the scheme by 2030 would have to reduce emissions by 43% compared to 2005. The question arises as to whether the EU&amp;rsquo;s objectives are not too ambitious and undermine social welfare. An assessment of the impact of the EU ETS on businesses may provide an answer to this question. While paying attention to the objective of companies, this assessment must deal with their value. This choice also reinforces the synthetic nature of this financial category, which is the resultant of all spheres of a company&amp;rsquo;s operation2. The introduction of corrective regulations should increase the value of some companies and decrease that of others. The only negative impact of the regulations on the value of enterprises can therefore be equated with a decrease in social welfare in material terms. Assessing the impact of the introduction of the EU ETS on company value is a huge challenge, as the issue is multi-faceted and interdisciplinary. Therefore, solving the problem required dividing the research into several stages and adopting several, inherently debatable, assumptions. In the first chapter the fundamental significance of the surplus rate, i.e. the difference between profitability and the cost of capital, for the value of a company was proved. An in-depth assessment of the impact of the introduction of the EU ETS on company value can therefore be based on this financial category. It has also been noted that emission allowances have many characteristics of taxes. As a result, the important methodological reference of the thesis to theories directly and indirectly explaining the relationship between taxes and firm value was justified. This is of considerable importance as the relationship between taxes and company value has a very strong theoretical basis, as evidenced, for example, by theories of company valuation. In the case of the impact of greenhouse gas emission allowances on company value, the acquis on international tax competition and tax incidence (tax shifting) can be particularly useful. If international competition in environmental regulation was unfair, then the introduction of the EU ETS should affect company value. However, the ability of companies to shift costs forward and/or backward is a constraint. In th is aspect, it is reasonable to refer to tax incidence studies based on the analysis of the profitability of companies. On the one hand, they enrich the existing research on the phenomenon of cost shifting of emission allowances. On the other hand, they correspond to the excess return component. The discussion in chapter two shows that there are numerous forms of environmental regulations in the world. However, it is difficult to assess whether they ensure fair international competition. Even similar regulations (e.g. organised emissions trading) have numerous exceptions and detailed rules. Moreover, all regulations have been subject to numerous modifications over the years. The design of the EU ETS includes a number of mechanisms to protect participants in the system from loss of competitiveness, as well as rules that respect their diversity (national and sectoral). However, not all differences between enterprises have been taken into account, especially those related to the size of enterprises. Large companies are more active in the allowance market, use more sophisticated tools to manage their emissions and have lower measurement, reporting and verification costs per tonne of carbon emitted. They may therefore experience unintended benefits or disproportionate cost-sharing. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of investments resulting in greenhouse gas reductions is linked to the individual characteristics of companies. Therefore, the assessment of the impact of emission allowances on company value has to be carried out at the microeconomic level. The review of the literature on the impact of the EU ETS on broadly defined company value, made in the third chapter demonstrates the uncoordinated and fragmented nature of these studies. Of particular importance, however, is the research on profitability and the cost of capital. As proved in the first chapter, profitability, cost of capital and enterprise value are all in a strong relationship with each other, which under several assumptions takes the form of a functional relationship. It is possible to formulate a consistent and theoretically firmly grounded method of analysing the impact of emission allowances on company value. First, it was decided to analyse the impact of allowances on corporate profitability. Following the example of Krzyżaniak and Musgrave&amp;rsquo;s study on the tax incidence, a variable was included which represents the ratio of the size of the &amp;ldquo;tax liability&amp;rdquo; due to the need to purchase allowances (EUAs) to the invested capital. This variable took the form of the ratio of missing emission allowances to total assets. For the selection of control variables, research in resource-based organizational theory was primarily used. This choice was supported by a large number of papers in which corporate profitability was the explained variable. The study of the impact of emission allowances on the profitability of enterprises was carried out on a balanced sample of 1,083 enterprises, in 2008&amp;ndash;2016 (the number of observations was 9,747). The information used in the analysis came from two sources &amp;ndash; the ORBIS database and the database of the Directorate-General for the Environment of the European Commission. The analyses of the impact of emission allowances on profitability in the short term (Arellano-Bond and Blundell-Bond models) show that after including in the model a variable representing the change in sales revenues, the examined variable (the ratio of missing emission allowances to the value of assets) ceases to be statistically significant. In contrast, including only productivity in the model was devoid of such an effect3. This means that in the short term, enterprises mainly shift the cost of allowances by changing the price of their products, while productivity takes time to improve. The long-run study shows that the ratio of missing allowances to total assets had a significant positive impact on companies&amp;rsquo; profitability. This may imply that companies had the ability to shift the cost of allowances and did so with a surplus. This result would be consistent with the conjecture appearing in the literature that companies would pass on allowance costs to consumers by raising prices. However, when a variable representing the change in sales revenues was placed in the model, the directional coefficient of the variable under study (the ratio of missing allowances to assets) was only slightly reduced and the variable remained statistic",OpenAlex(DOI),0,10.2139/ssrn.2373495,https://openalex.org/W4402276215,2013,SSRN Electronic Journal,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-biblio:  “ Asset Pricing when 'This Time is Different '” January 2016,Asset Pricing when 'This Time is Different',10.2139/ssrn.2373495,,Goal 13,0.120918584,TRUE,GHG emissions; UNFCCC; carbon emissions; carbon footprint; carbon pricing; climate change; climate commitments; climate finance; climate governance; climate impact reduction; climate investment; climate mitigation; climate policy; climate-related hazards; emissions reduction; global climate action; global warming; greenhouse gas emissions; industrial emissions; institutional capacity for climate action; transport emissions

Gender gaps in various outcomes (competitiveness, labour force participation, and performance in mathematics, among many others) show remarkable differences across countries and tend to persist over time. The economics literature initially explained these differences by looking at standard economic variables such as the level of development, women’s education, the expansion of the service sector, and discrimination. More recent literature has argued that gender differences in a variety of outcomes could reflect underlying cultural values and beliefs. This article reviews the literature on the relevance of culture in the determination of different forms of gender gap. I examine how differences in historical situations could have been relevant in generating gender differences and the conditions under which gender norms tend to be stable or to change over time, emphasizing the role of social learning. Finally, I review the role of different forms of cultural transmission in shaping gender differences, distinguishing between channels of vertical transmission (the role of the family), horizontal transmission (the role of peers), and oblique transmission (the role of teachers or role models).",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4245327207,,,no_abstract_all_sources,"CR-biblio:“Gender and Culture”, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 2020, 36 (4), 944-961",,,,Goal 5,0.146767251,TRUE,gender and technology; gender bias; gender discrimination; gender disparities; gender equality; gender equity; gender inequality; gender norms; gender wage gap; gender-focused policies; gender-sensitive policies

The small body of work examining intraminority intergroup relations, or relations between members of different disadvantaged groups, reveals that salient experiences of ingroup discrimination promote positive relations between groups that share a dimension of identity (e.g., 2 different racial minority groups) and negative relations between groups that do not share a dimension of identity (e.g., a racial minority group and a sexual minority group). In the present work, we propose that shared experiences of discrimination between groups that do not share an identity dimension can be used as a lever to facilitate positive intraminority intergroup relations. Five experiments examining relations among 4 different disadvantaged groups supported this hypothesis. Both blatant (Experiments 1 and 3) and subtle (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) connections to shared experiences of discrimination, or inducing a similarity-seeking mindset in the context of discrimination faced by one's ingroup (Experiment 5), increased support for policies benefiting the outgroup (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and reduced intergroup bias (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Taken together, these experiments provide converging evidence that highlighting shared experiences of discrimination can improve intergroup outcomes between stigmatized groups across dimensions of social identity. Implications of these findings for intraminority intergroup relations are discussed.

U.K. and Northampton, MA USA: Edward Elgar.",2015,Sustainable careers: Then and now,"This chapter examines sustainable careers within an historical context. We begin with a group of 1970s scholars who believed that studying careers required sensitivity to both psychological experiences and social context over time. Their approach provided a foundation for the interdisciplinary perspective reflected in our Handbook of Career Theory (1989), an explicit recognition that career theory's home involves many disciplines, at many levels of analysis. Much has changed since then. Sustainable careers require that individuals recognize responsibility for their work within, across and outside organizations. They also require that organizations find innovative solutions for helping individuals reach their full potential while maximizing their institutions' performance. However, much of the earlier work on careers can still inform the sustainable careers' dialogue: we have a durable definition of career, everyone has a career, careers are interdependent with people's lives, and an interdisciplinary approach is more important than ever. We see the sustainable career as an 'ideal type'. It may never be fully realized, but it should be a goal in future careers research and responsible human resource management.

Communicating Between Groups, Communicating About GroupsBuilding from the introductory chapter, this chapter will elaborate on social identity theory and its intellectual sister theories (e.g., self-categorization theory).Further, we will focus particularly on language strategies used in an intergroup context (i.e., labels, language abstractness, and metaphors) and intergroup communication related to specific social groups (i.e., gender, race, and more fluid categories such as socio-geographical background and sexual orientation).More specifically this chapter is structured in three parts that follow a brief overview of intergroup communication in relation to social identity, self-categorization, and communication accommodation theory.In the first part, we will discuss three language tools that play a prominent role in communicating within, across, and about social groups.These include group labels, which can create friendly or hostile intergroup relations and can induce stereotype threat in those targeted by the same label.In the second part, we will cover language abstraction and metaphors, both of which can play a very important role in intergroup communication, as they reflect, maintain, and create intergroup bias and aid stereotype dissemination.Whereas in the first part of the chapter we will be referring to groups in general (with some specific examples), in the second part we will address issues related to important social categories.We will address gender and race and, subsequently, more fluid categories such as social class, geographical/regional background, and sexual orientation.The section on gender will cover issues related to grammatical gender (e.g., actor vs. actress) and the consequences of using masculine forms to represent both females and males.The part on interracial communication will address the issue of race/ethnicity in terms of labels we use to address different groups as well as what we know about interaction between people of different races.In the section on fluid social categories, we will discuss the effect that subtle acoustic cues have on the perception of social groups with malleable 4 category boundaries such as social class or sexual orientation.In the final section, our concluding remarks about intergroup communication will highlight the most important issues in our current knowledge, and outline possible future directions in which research may move.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,10.2307/jj.14491562.11,https://openalex.org/W4256200309,2022,The Impact of Devolution in Wales,no_abstract_from_cr,CR-biblio:McCann 2019 IECHYD DA,IECHYD DA?,10.2307/jj.14491562.11,,Goal 1,0.077198385,TRUE,gender-sensitive strategies

Importantly, these differences diminish or disappear among people in positions of power: female authorities converge to the behavior of their male counterparts, such that the gender gaps in valence and willingness to converse on controversial content disappear.

The authors apply three employment network measures to a large employer–employee matched Brazilian panel data set to find that network structures are strongly predictive of both firm survival and growth. All else equal, new firms with previously connected founding employees experience higher survival odds but slower early growth. Results suggest that working with former co-workers confers benefits such as resolved informational asymmetries, increased resource sharing, and nonpecuniary gains—qualities that are vital to new firm survival. High growth, however, likely benefits from a more varied resource set, facilitated by drawing on individuals from a multiplicity of employment backgrounds. In addition, the absence of prior ties may itself render the profit motive dominant, thereby increasing growth. Results are consistent across most sectors, initial firm sizes, and other sample selection criteria.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W2232065912,,,likely_no_public_abstract,"CR-biblio:  2.

Because entrepreneurial earnings are notoriously difficult to measure, I approach the question from an expenditure angle. I look at how switching into self-employment corresponds to changes in reported earnings versus expenditure. Using 45 years of longitudinal data, I find that individuals report earning 27.7% less in self-employment, while spending 3.8% more. This household expenditure premium accrues with entrepreneurial experience and is not offset by lower savings or longer work hours. The results hold in highly educated and incorporated business owner subsamples.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4392927889,,,likely_no_public_abstract,"CR-biblio:5.

We follow the careers of 8,667 male and female scientists from the post-doctoral fellowship and early assistant professor stages to becoming a principal investigator (PI) – a critical transition point in the academic life sciences. We apply time-to-event analysis using a unique dataset that connects individuals' National Institutes of Health funding histories to their publication records. We find that the transition to PI could account for a substantial share of the gender gap in the life sciences, with women experiencing up to 31% lower transition rates than men. Differences in publication records can only explain about a third of this lower transition rate. Gender differences in the returns to publication records explained more of the gender gap in transition rates.

Concerned by this burden, governments and private donors have undertaken large, high-profile efforts to relieve medical debt. We partnered with RIP Medical Debt (now Undue Medical Debt) to conduct two randomized experiments that relieved medical debt with a face value of $169 million for 83,401 people between 2018 and 2020. Our experiments focused on downstream medical debt that had been sold to debt collectors, and one of our experiments straddled an industry-wide pullback in the reporting of medical debt to the credit bureaus, allowing us to estimate the effects of debt relief with and without counterfactual reporting. We track outcomes using credit reports, collections account data, and a multimodal survey. There are three sets of results. First, we find a modest improvement in credit access when there is counterfactual credit reporting, but no impact on credit report outcomes when there is not. Second, we estimate that debt relief causes a moderate but statistically significant reduction in payments of existing medical bills. Third, we find no effects on survey measures of mental and physical health, healthcare utilization, and financial wellness. Taken together, our results indicate that the strong correlations documented in prior research do not translate into causal effects for downstream medical debt relief.",OpenAlex(DOI),0,,https://openalex.org/W4405809331,,,likely_no_public_abstract,"CR-biblio:  The Quarterly Journal of Economics , 140(2): May 2025, 1187–1241",,,,Goal 17,0.071930402,TRUE,debt distress; debt relief
