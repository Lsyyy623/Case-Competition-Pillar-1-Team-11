Using single-cell RNA sequencing of T cells in 21 cancer types from more than 300 patients, Zheng et al. identified differences in transcript composition that could be used to catalog different T cell types (see the Perspective by van der Leun and Schumacher). These annotations identified the different roles of specific types of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells among the different tumor types. Some of these clusters revealed evidence for two developmental paths for T cells, one of which shows a trajectory toward the “exhausted” T cell state, knowledge of which may be useful in developing future cancer immunotherapies. —LMZ Single-cell RNA sequencing of cancer-associated T cells elucidates links between immune cell types and tumor characteristics. INTRODUCTION Cancer immunotherapies that target tumor-specific T cells have benefited many cancer patients, but the clinical efficacy varies greatly among different cancer types. Tumor-infiltrating T cells often enter a dysfunctional state, widely known as T cell exhaustion, and the antitumor functions of effector T cells are regulated by multiple factors, including the presence of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). The states and abundances of T cells vary across tumor microenvironments (TMEs) of different cancer types, which may fundamentally influence different clinical parameters such as drug response to immunotherapies. RATIONALE To build a high-resolution pan-cancer T cell atlas, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumors, paracancerous tissues, and blood samples from patients of various cancer types and collected additional published scRNA-seq datasets. The diverse data were integrated after correcting confounding factors and batch effects. This atlas was composed of scRNA-seq data from 316 patients across 21 cancer types. T cell receptor (TCR) sequences of individual T cells with gene expression profiles were assembled to characterize the expansion and dynamics of T cells. Various computational methods were applied to investigate the features and abundance of T cells across cancer types. RESULTS We identified multiple potentially tumor-reactive T cell (pTRT) populations in cancer patients. The states of the pTRTs varied dramatically in the tumor microenvironment of different cancer types. For CD8+ T cells, the major pTRTs were exhausted T cells and exhibited high heterogeneity. We computationally inferred two major developmental paths to T cell exhaustion, through effector memory T cells and tissue-resident memory T cells, respectively, and both were prevalent among cancer types. We also noted the state transitions between terminal exhausted T cells and cells such as natural killer (NK)–like T cells, Type 17 CD8+ T cells (Tc17 cells) cells, and CD8+ Treg cells, but such transitions tend to occur in specific cancer types. For CD4+ T cells, follicular helper T cell (TFH)/T helper 1 (TH1) dual-functional T cells, which appeared to originate from TFH cells, were also notable pTRTs and correlated with the tumor mutation burden. We also found that the transcriptional programs of pTRTs could be affected by transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) and interferons in the TMEs. The abundances of T cell states vary dramatically depending on cancer types. On the basis of tumor-infiltrating T cell compositions, cancer patients could be immune-typed as a group with high frequencies of terminal exhausted CD8+ T cells and another group with high frequencies of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells, and the immune types were associated with clinical traits such as patient survival and responses to immune checkpoint blockade. CONCLUSION We depicted the pan-cancer landscape of T cell heterogeneity and dynamics in the TME and established a baseline reference for future temporal or spatial studies associated with cancer treatments. The systematic comparison across cancer types revealed the commonalities and differences of T cell states in different TMEs. Our detailed signature, dynamics, and regulations of tumor-infiltrating T cells will facilitate the development of immunotherapies, and our proposed immune-typing can aid the therapeutic and diagnostic strategies that target T cells. Systematic analysis of a human pan-cancer T cell atlas. We analyzed approximately 390,000 T cells from 316 patients of 21 cancer types by means of scRNA-seq. Combining gene expression profiles and T cell receptor sequences, we investigated the heterogeneity and dynamics of tumor-infiltrating T cells and performed a systematic comparison of T cells among cancer types. Additionally, we provided a T cell composition–based immune-typing scheme. KIR, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor; IL26, interleukin-26. T cells play a central role in cancer immunotherapy, but we lack systematic comparison of the heterogeneity and dynamics of tumor-infiltrating T cells across cancer types. We built a single-cell RNA-sequencing pan-cancer atlas of T cells for 316 donors across 21 cancer types and revealed distinct T cell composition patterns. We found multiple state-transition paths in the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells and the preference of those paths among different tumor types. Certain T cell populations showed specific correlation with patient properties such as mutation burden, shedding light on the possible determinants of the tumor microenvironment. T cell compositions within tumors alone could classify cancer patients into groups with clinical trait specificity, providing new insights into T cell immunity and precision immunotherapy targeting T cells.",Semantic Scholar,11.4285714285714,10.1126/science.abe6474,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eda76900f3954e1930080779b5cfb92274a11da3,,,Goal 1,0.00451546921643153,False,

We show that this simple objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL, without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples. Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than self-consistency and sequential refinement.

In Mo-Mask, a hierarchical quantization scheme is employed to represent human motion as multi-layer discrete motion tokens with high-fidelity details. Starting at the base layer, with a sequence of motion tokens obtained by vector quan-tization, the residual tokens of increasing orders are de-rived and stored at the subsequent layers of the hierar-chy. This is consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the base-layer motion tokens, a Masked Transformer is designated to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage. During generation (i. e. inference) stage, starting from an empty sequence, our Masked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently, a Residual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens based on the results from current layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMask outperforms the state-of-art methods on the text-to-motion generation task, with an FID of 0.045 (vs e.g. 0.141 of T2M-GPT) on the HumanML3D dataset, and 0.228 (vs 0.514) on KIT-ML, respectively.

A key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, which we address through the following approaches. First, we train LLMs to convert natural language math problems from the Numina dataset to equivalent formal statements in Lean 4. This process creates the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1, which includes 1.64 million formal statements. Next, we develop a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each new prover can prove many statements that previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. Finally, we obtain the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1-solved, which contains proofs for over 800K statements from Goedel-Pset-v1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base on Goedel-Pset-v1-solved (i.e., no RL) yields a Goedel-Prover-SFT that achieves a success rate of 57.6% (Pass@32) on miniF2F, surpassing the previous leader DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL (trained using SFT + RL on a proprietary dataset) by 7.6%.

Many mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are undefined. The relationships between patterns of mutations and epigenetic phenotypes are not yet clear.


METHODS
We analyzed the genomes of 200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150 cases), along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis.


RESULTS
AML genomes have fewer mutations than most other adult cancers, with an average of only 13 mutations found in genes. Of these, an average of 5 are in genes that are recurrently mutated in AML. A total of 23 genes were significantly mutated, and another 237 were mutated in two or more samples. Nearly all samples had at least 1 nonsynonymous mutation in one of nine categories of genes that are almost certainly relevant for pathogenesis, including transcription-factor fusions (18% of cases), the gene encoding nucleophosmin (NPM1) (27%), tumor-suppressor genes (16%), DNA-methylation-related genes (44%), signaling genes (59%), chromatin-modifying genes (30%), myeloid transcription-factor genes (22%), cohesin-complex genes (13%), and spliceosome-complex genes (14%). Patterns of cooperation and mutual exclusivity suggested strong biologic relationships among several of the genes and categories.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified at least one potential driver mutation in nearly all AML samples and found that a complex interplay of genetic events contributes to AML pathogenesis in individual patients. The databases from this study are widely available to serve as a foundation for further investigations of AML pathogenesis, classification, and risk stratification.

They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits. Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false. However, a-priori candidates are significantly over-represented among these associations as well, making many of them excellent candidates for follow-up experiments.

This uncertainty is one of the principal causes for the demise of large populations around the world suffering from some fatal diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Due to this reason, the diagnosis of this disease is of great concern for healthcare systems. In such a case, machine learning can be used as an effective tool to reduce the randomness in clinical decision making. Conventional methods for the detection of chronic kidney disease are not always accurate because of their high degree of dependency on several sets of biological attributes. Machine learning is the process of training a machine using a vast collection of historical data for the purpose of intelligent classification. This work aims at developing a machine-learning model that can use a publicly available data to forecast the occurrence of chronic kidney disease. A set of data preprocessing steps were performed on this dataset in order to construct a generic model. This set of steps includes the appropriate imputation of missing data points, along with the balancing of data using the SMOTE algorithm and the scaling of the features. A statistical technique, namely, the chi-squared test, is used for the extraction of the least-required set of adequate and highly correlated features to the output. For the model training, a stack of supervised-learning techniques is used for the development of a robust machine-learning model. Out of all the applied learning techniques, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) achieved the lowest false-negative rates and test accuracy, equal to 99.33% and 98.67%, respectively.

Individuals that lack specific IFNs can be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Furthermore, the autoantibody system dampens IFN response to prevent damage from pathogen-induced inflammation. Two studies now examine the likelihood that genetics affects the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through components of this system (see the Perspective by Beck and Aksentijevich). Q. Zhang et al. used a candidate gene approach and identified patients with severe COVID-19 who have mutations in genes involved in the regulation of type I and III IFN immunity. They found enrichment of these genes in patients and conclude that genetics may determine the clinical course of the infection. Bastard et al. identified individuals with high titers of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN-α2 and IFN-ω in about 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These autoantibodies were not found either in infected people who were asymptomatic or had milder phenotype or in healthy individuals. Together, these studies identify a means by which individuals at highest risk of life-threatening COVID-19 can be identified. Science, this issue p. eabd4570, p. eabd4585; see also p. 404 A large immunological and genomics study of COVID-19 patients reveals excess mutations in the type I IFN pathway. INTRODUCTION Clinical outcomes of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection range from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological studies have identified three risk factors for severe disease: being male, being elderly, and having other medical conditions. However, interindividual clinical variability remains huge in each demographic category. Discovering the root cause and detailed molecular, cellular, and tissue- and body-level mechanisms underlying life-threatening COVID-19 is of the utmost biological and medical importance. RATIONALE We established the COVID Human Genetic Effort (www.covidhge.com) to test the general hypothesis that life-threatening COVID-19 in some or most patients may be caused by monogenic inborn errors of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 with incomplete or complete penetrance. We sequenced the exome or genome of 659 patients of various ancestries with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia and 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. We tested the specific hypothesis that inborn errors of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)– and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)–dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity that underlie life-threatening influenza pneumonia also underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. We considered three loci identified as mutated in patients with life-threatening influenza: TLR3, IRF7, and IRF9. We also considered 10 loci mutated in patients with other viral illnesses but directly connected to the three core genes conferring influenza susceptibility: TICAM1/TRIF, UNC93B1, TRAF3, TBK1, IRF3, and NEMO/IKBKG from the TLR3-dependent type I IFN induction pathway, and IFNAR1, IFNAR2, STAT1, and STAT2 from the IRF7- and IRF9-dependent type I IFN amplification pathway. Finally, we considered various modes of inheritance at these 13 loci. RESULTS We found an enrichment in variants predicted to be loss-of-function (pLOF), with a minor allele frequency <0.001, at the 13 candidate loci in the 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to the 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection (P = 0.01). Experimental tests for all 118 rare nonsynonymous variants (including both pLOF and other variants) of these 13 genes found in patients with critical disease identified 23 patients (3.5%), aged 17 to 77 years, carrying 24 deleterious variants of eight genes. These variants underlie autosomal-recessive (AR) deficiencies (IRF7 and IFNAR1) and autosomal-dominant (AD) deficiencies (TLR3, UNC93B1, TICAM1, TBK1, IRF3, IRF7, IFNAR1, and IFNAR2) in four and 19 patients, respectively. These patients had never been hospitalized for other life-threatening viral illness. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells from IRF7-deficient patients produced no type I IFN on infection with SARS-CoV-2, and TLR3−/−, TLR3+/−, IRF7−/−, and IFNAR1−/− fibroblasts were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. CONCLUSION At least 3.5% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had known (AR IRF7 and IFNAR1 deficiencies or AD TLR3, TICAM1, TBK1, and IRF3 deficiencies) or new (AD UNC93B1, IRF7, IFNAR1, and IFNAR2 deficiencies) genetic defects at eight of the 13 candidate loci involved in the TLR3- and IRF7-dependent induction and amplification of type I IFNs. This discovery reveals essential roles for both the double-stranded RNA sensor TLR3 and type I IFN cell-intrinsic immunity in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type I IFN administration may be of therapeutic benefit in selected patients, at least early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN production and amplification underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Molecules in red are encoded by core genes, deleterious variants of which underlie critical influenza pneumonia with incomplete penetrance, and deleterious variants of genes encoding biochemically related molecules in blue underlie other viral illnesses. Molecules represented in bold are encoded by genes with variants that also underlie critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)– and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)–dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection.",Semantic Scholar,11.4942528735632,10.1126/science.abd4570,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/604828f0250f69697222db1027e91a1c6b9c6c7c,,,Goal 1,0.02710984571623036,False,COVID-19 impact

While the global population is becoming older, the scientific research about risk and protective factors related to IPV in the golden age is diverse, and the different findings of the various studies have not been systematized so far. Thus, in this systematic review, we aim to analyze the scientific studies that investigate the risk and the protective factors of violent dynamics between elderly couples. From the perspective of the theoretical frameworks and the methodological approaches used, we present the main conceptual themes that emerge. Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, we review the articles that report the analyses of protective and risk factors of IPV perpetration. Our results indicate social support, help-seeking behavior, and the availability of community-based services addressing the issues of abuse as the main protective factors. The risk factors are related to economic conditions, belonging to an ethnic minority, cognitive or physical impairment, other conditions associated with cultural background and relational dynamics, such as intrapartner dependence and intergenerational transmission of violence and trauma, and caregiving stress. We discuss possible future directions of research to improve the understanding of IPV in the elderly population and the implications for the development of intervention policies at preventive and supportive levels.",Semantic Scholar,13.7254901960784,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01595,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d83b245b48543f8b41c7c6abce475c4efb44b518,,,Goal 1,0.04146058723185139,False,

These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain, yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space, which is at the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work, we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R, a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections, operating without prior infor-mation about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps, relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided, we fur-ther propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common refer-ence frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders, allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information, but interestingly, we can seamlessly recover from it, pixel matches, focal lengths, relative and absolute cameras. Extensive experiments on all these tasks showcase how DUSt3R effectively unifies various 3D vision tasks, setting new performance records on monocular & multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation.

These CoVs have caused a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe distress syndromes (ARDS), resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Areas Covered The accelerated advancements in antiviral drug discovery, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, have shed new light on the imperative to develop treatments effective against a broad spectrum of CoVs. This perspective discusses strategies and lessons learnt in targeting viral non-structural proteins, structural proteins, drug repurposing, and combinational approaches for the development of antivirals against CoVs. Expert opinion Drawing lessons from the pandemic, it becomes evident that the absence of efficient broad-spectrum antiviral drugs increases the vulnerability of public health systems to the potential onslaught by highly pathogenic CoVs. The rapid and sustained spread of novel CoVs can have devastating consequences without effective and specifically targeted treatments. Prioritizing the effective development of broad-spectrum antivirals is imperative for bolstering the resilience of public health systems and mitigating the potential impact of future highly pathogenic CoVs.",Semantic Scholar,14.6341463414634,10.1080/17460441.2024.2385598,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8d03f03d0fb6232c80e839a2d5e2584cc918bd8b,,,Goal 3,0.06371777308307094,True,COVID-19 impact

Graphical Abstract Highlights New platform for high throughput detection of transient interactions between membrane proteins. IL20RA is a receptor for the orphan checkpoint inhibitor B7-H3. The natural killer cell protein KIR2DL5A binds the immune receptor PVR. KIR2DL5 binding to PVR regulates natural killer cell cytotoxicity and inhibits tumor cell killing. Elucidation of receptor interactomes to gain insights into extracellular protein biology. Receptors expressed on the plasma membrane and their interacting partners critically regulate cellular communication during homeostasis and disease, and as such represent main therapeutic targets. Despite its importance for drug development, receptor-ligand proteomics has remained a daunting field, in part because of the challenges associated to the study of membrane-expressed proteins. Here, to enable sensitive detection of receptor-ligand interactions in high throughput, we implement a new platform, the Conditioned Media AlphaScreen, for interrogation of a library consisting of most single transmembrane human proteins. Using this method to study key immune receptors, we identify and further validate the interleukin receptor IL20RA as the first binding partner for the checkpoint inhibitor B7-H3. Further, KIR2DL5, a natural killer cell protein that had remained orphan, is uncovered as a functional binding partner for the poliovirus receptor (PVR). This interaction is characterized using orthogonal assays, which demonstrate that PVR specifically engages KIR2DL5 on natural killer cells leading to inhibition of cytotoxicity. Altogether, these results reveal unappreciated links between protein families that may importantly influence receptor-driven functions during disease. Applicable to any target of interest, this technology represents a versatile and powerful approach for elucidation of receptor-ligand interactomes, which is essential to understand basic aspects of the biology of the plasma membrane proteins and ultimately inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",Semantic Scholar,42.8571428571428,10.1074/mcp.TIR119.001433,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8631c7c3f18ccdf9b02919bc8472adede2db287c,,,Goal 17,0.01380237854809734,False,

To evaluate the reliability and validity of a semistructured measure of obsessive-compulsive symptom severity in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).


METHOD
Sixty-five children with OCD (25 girls and 40 boys, aged 8 to 17 years) were assessed with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). Interrater agreement was assessed by four raters in a subsample (n = 24). Discriminant and convergent validity were assessed by comparing CY-BOCS scores to self-ratings of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.


RESULTS
Internal consistency was high, measuring .87 for the 10 items. The intraclass correlations for the CY-BOCS Total, Obsession, and Compulsion scores were .84, .91, and .68, suggesting good to excellent interrater agreement for subscale and total scores. The CY-BOCS Total score showed a significantly higher correlation with a self-report of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (r = .62 for the Leyton survey) compared with the Children's Depression Inventory (r = .34) and the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (r = .37) (p = .02 and .05, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
The CY-BOCS yields reliable and valid subscale and total scores for obsessive-compulsive symptom severity in children and adolescents with OCD. Reliability and validity appear to be influenced by age of the child and the hazards associated with integrating data from parental and patient sources.",Semantic Scholar,14.4578313253012,10.1097/00004583-199706000-00023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fd9337c533435793055162d75db603363eaa673,,,Goal 4,0.009054117209128083,False,

Endotracheal intubation is an essential step in airway management. During the intubation process, the patient’s cough may produce secretions and become a source of transmission to infect the caregivers and surrounding working area. Many intubation precautions and devices have been proposed,1 including medications, personal protective equipment (PPE), and barrier enclosure. A barrier enclosure has recently been proven to effectively minimize the spread of patients’ droplets and aerosols during intubation.2 However, in the scenario of suspicious/confirmed COVID-19 patients who need to undergo emergency surgery, extubation and emergence cough after general anesthesia are another potential source of transmission, and might contaminate the operating room. The importance of COVID19 extubation should be emphasized to minimize the potential virus infection during a surgery. Both level-3 PPE and negative pressure operating rooms are suggested for such cases. Here we proposed a simple, carton-made, protective shield that provides an effective reduction of transmission of droplets and aerosols during both intubation and extubation. First, we used a carton made of corrugated fiberboard as an alternative to the transparent plastic cube; the design diagrams of the protective shield are now available as an open source at the aerosol block website.3 Then we used a transparent plastic wrap to cover the upper portion of the carton, which allows direct vision inside the shield (Figure 1). The advantage of corrugated fiberboard is the flexibility to tailor the size of the shield according to the patient’s appearance and surgical need. It is also easy to obtain corrugated fiberboard cartons, and the shield is disposable after a single use. Before using, to avoid patient anxiety, we recommended communication with the patient describing the protective shield and why it is necessary in the anesthetic evaluation. Second, all the intubation devices (video laryngoscope with disposal blade is recommended) should be set inside the shield before induction, including anesthetic circuit and suction tube through the side ports of the shield. After preoxygenation, the laryngoscopist should perform a rapid sequence induction and intubation following COVID19 perioperative management recommendations for the local institution. Communicating with the surgeon is also important to ensure that the protective shield will not occupy the operation field.

To address this gap, this article synthesizes literature to provide tools for incorporating intersectionality into marketing research, including a framework for an intersectional marketing paradigm, a research design roadmap, a research agenda, and key takeaways for stakeholders. The definition of intersectionality focuses on three main components: (1) awareness and acknowledgment of overlapping (rather than isolated) social categories (e.g., gender, race, and class), (2) understanding of how differences in lived experiences at these intersections influence the marketplace, and (3) recognition of how power shapes these lived experiences. This article's novel research design roadmap features concrete theoretical and methodological approaches for marketing researchers from various backgrounds to utilize intersectionality in solving marketing problems: conducting exploratory subsample analyses, developing intersectional theory and hypotheses, conducting inclusive literature reviews, collecting and reporting detailed demographics, sampling understudied populations, and carefully situating conclusions. The research agenda provides research questions for emerging topics at societal, organizational, and consumer levels. Engaging with intersectionality will help ensure that marketing remains socially relevant, develops diverse and inclusive theories, and more accurately reflects the lived experiences of understudied populations and communities.",Semantic Scholar,13.0434782608696,10.1177/00222429241258493,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4be5aa80e225d9143402e80e5430733c8488de64,,,Goal 5,0.02717554521530603,False,

Due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to identify the patients and investigate their immune responses. Protein microarray is one of the best platforms to profile the antibodies in the blood because of its fast, multiplexed, and sensitive nature. To fully understand the immune responses and biological specificities, this study developed a human coronavirus (HCoV) protein microarray and included all seven human coronaviruses and three influenza viruses. Each protein was printed in triplicate and formed 14 identical blocks per array. The HCoV protein microarray showed high reproducibility and sensitivity to the monoclonal antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid protein with detection limits of 10–200 pg. The HCoV proteins that were immobilized on the array were properly folded and functional by showing interactions with a known human receptor, e.g., ACE2. By profiling the serum IgG and IgA from 32 COVID-19 patients and 36 healthy patients, the HCoV protein microarray demonstrated 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity with two biomarkers.

Not only have microbial communities in the urinary tract been implicated in the maintenance of health but alterations in their composition have also been associated with different urinary pathologies, such as urinary tract infections (UTI). Therefore, the study of the urinary microbiome in healthy individuals, as well as its involvement in disease through the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens, could open a potential field of study, leading to new insights into prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies for urinary pathologies.

This disallows patients from using a substance they find beneficial, when other treatments have failed, for symptom relief including pain, nausea, insomnia, and mood. We found no other facilities with medical cannabis policies. Our team amended the medical cannabis policy to align with California state laws to facilitate inpatient use. Project aims were to (1) align the policy with state guidelines, (2) update workflow including eligibility algorithm with lockbox, and (3) improve patients’ pain relief. Description A clinical nurse specialist spearheaded a cannabis interdisciplinary integration committee. A medical cannabis policy existed but did not meet recent legislative changes, prohibiting inpatient cannabis utilization. The committee revamped existing policy and created an eligibility algorithm, a medical administration record order, and a drug cross-referencing guide. Outcome Fifty patients were able to utilize cannabis during their inpatient stay over a 1-year period after medical cannabis policy implementation. Pain relief was the primary reason for cannabis usage, with 60% of surveyed patients reporting reducing opioids since starting cannabis. Conclusion Implementation of the revamped medical cannabis procedure to facilitate inpatient use was successful in implementation and patient outcomes. This can serve as a guiding framework for other institutions.",Semantic Scholar,16.0,10.1097/NUR.0000000000000899,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1accda2384a431b7f364bfcd3cde8d7b0caa29c,,,Goal 3,0.01135099236367198,False,

The high sensitivity of the instrument enabled the determination of the flux and spectrum of the source on a night-by-night basis. Throughout our observational campaign, the flux from Mrk 501 was found to vary by an order of magnitude. Intranight flux variability with flux-doubling times down to 2 minutes was observed during the two most active nights, namely, June 30 and July 9. These are the fastest flux variations ever observed in Mrk 501. The ~20 minute long flare of July 9 showed an indication of a 4 ± 1 minute time delay between the peaks of F(<0.25 TeV) and F(>1.2 TeV), which may indicate a progressive acceleration of electrons in the emitting plasma blob. The flux variability was quantified for several energy ranges and found to increase with the energy of the γ-ray photons. The spectra hardened significantly with increasing flux, and during the two most active nights, a spectral peak was clearly detected at 0.43 ± 0.06 and 0.25 ± 0.07 TeV, respectively, for June 30 and July 9. There is no evidence of such a spectral feature for the other nights at energies down to 0.10 TeV, thus suggesting that the spectral peak is correlated with the source luminosity. These observed characteristics could be accommodated in a synchrotron self-Compton framework in which the increase in γ-ray flux is produced by a freshly injected (high energy) electron population.",Semantic Scholar,27.8481012658228,10.1086/521382,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88f41bb85bbc1db7fef81dfaf6f71b5fe3a837ab,,,Goal 7,0.0807139049797028,True,thermal energy

In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.",Semantic Scholar,22.5806451612903,10.48550/arXiv.2403.16933,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c792c4fd76204bea7c35e45625c8cacdb7e0afc3,,,Goal 7,0.02724501985938445,False,

Individuals that lack specific IFNs can be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Furthermore, the autoantibody system dampens IFN response to prevent damage from pathogen-induced inflammation. Two studies now examine the likelihood that genetics affects the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through components of this system (see the Perspective by Beck and Aksentijevich). Q. Zhang et al. used a candidate gene approach and identified patients with severe COVID-19 who have mutations in genes involved in the regulation of type I and III IFN immunity. They found enrichment of these genes in patients and conclude that genetics may determine the clinical course of the infection. Bastard et al. identified individuals with high titers of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN-α2 and IFN-ω in about 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These autoantibodies were not found either in infected people who were asymptomatic or had milder phenotype or in healthy individuals. Together, these studies identify a means by which individuals at highest risk of life-threatening COVID-19 can be identified. Science, this issue p. eabd4570, p. eabd4585; see also p. 404 In a large immunological and genomics study of COVID-19 patients, autoantibodies to type 1 interferons correlated with outcomes. INTRODUCTION Interindividual clinical variability is vast in humans infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ranging from silent infection to rapid death. Three risk factors for life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia have been identified—being male, being elderly, or having other medical conditions—but these risk factors cannot explain why critical disease remains relatively rare in any given epidemiological group. Given the rising toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality, understanding the causes and mechanisms of life-threatening COVID-19 is crucial. RATIONALE B cell autoimmune infectious phenocopies of three inborn errors of cytokine immunity exist, in which neutralizing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (mycobacterial disease), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (staphylococcal disease), and IL-17A and IL-17F (mucocutaneous candidiasis) mimic the clinical phenotypes of germline mutations of the genes that encode the corresponding cytokines or receptors. Human inborn errors of type I IFNs underlie severe viral respiratory diseases. Neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs, which have been found in patients with a few underlying noninfectious conditions, have not been unequivocally shown to underlie severe viral infections. While searching for inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, we also tested the hypothesis that neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs may underlie critical COVID-19. We searched for auto-Abs against type I IFNs in 987 patients hospitalized for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, 663 asymptomatic or mildly affected individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 1227 healthy controls from whom samples were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS At least 101 of 987 patients (10.2%) with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) auto-Abs against IFN-ω (13 patients), against the 13 types of IFN-α (36), or against both (52) at the onset of critical disease; a few also had auto-Abs against the other three individual type I IFNs. These auto-Abs neutralize high concentrations of the corresponding type I IFNs, including their ability to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Moreover, all of the patients tested had low or undetectable serum IFN-α levels during acute disease. These auto-Abs were present before infection in the patients tested and were absent from 663 individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (P < 10−16). They were present in only 4 of 1227 (0.33%) healthy individuals (P < 10−16) before the pandemic. The patients with auto-Abs were 25 to 87 years old (half were over 65) and of various ancestries. Notably, 95 of the 101 patients with auto-Abs were men (94%). CONCLUSION A B cell autoimmune phenocopy of inborn errors of type I IFN immunity accounts for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men. In these patients, adaptive autoimmunity impairs innate and intrinsic antiviral immunity. These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening COVID-19 and the increase in risk with age. They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening COVID-19 and ensuring their enrolment in vaccine trials. Finally, they pave the way for prevention and treatment, including plasmapheresis, plasmablast depletion, and recombinant type I IFNs not targeted by the auto-Abs (e.g., IFN-β). Neutralizing auto-Abs to type I IFNs underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. We tested the hypothesis that neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs may underlie critical COVID-19 by impairing the binding of type I IFNs to their receptor and the activation of the downstream responsive pathway. Neutralizing auto-Abs are represented in red, and type I IFNs are represented in blue. In these patients, adaptive autoimmunity impairs innate and intrinsic antiviral immunity.

Soc. 106 (1963), 222–229] is a well-known strategy to prove that specific positions are (at most) a draw for the first player. For non-overlapping possible winning lines (groups) it requires two empty squares per group to be marked, i.e., with a coverage ratio of 2.0. In this paper we present a new strategy, called Set Matching.1 1 This work is an extension of research presented at the ACG 2017 conference, which was published [in: Advances in Computer Games: 15th International Conference, ACG 2017, Springer, 2017, pp. 38–50]. A matching set consists of a set of nodes (the markers), a set of possible winning lines (the groups), and a coverage set indicating how all groups are covered after every first black move. This strategy needs less than two markers per group. As such it is able to prove positions in k-in-a-Row games to be draws, which cannot be proven using the Hales–Jewett pairing strategy. We show several efficient configurations with their matching sets. These include Cycle Configurations, BiCycle Configurations, and PolyCycle Configurations involving more than two cycles. Depending on configuration, the coverage ratio can be reduced to as low as 1.14. Many examples in the domain of solving k-in-a-Row games are given, including the direct proof (not based on search) that the empty 4 × 4 board is a draw for 4-in-a-Row. To illustrate the power of the method we also show two applications, which prove that 9-in-a-Row and 8-in-a-Row on infinite boards (and hence on any finite board as well) are draws, in a much more rigid way than by case analysis.",Semantic Scholar,15.0537634408602,10.3233/ICG-180053,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6fe68eda0be775b6b475af813366c4facc883e71,,,Goal 3,0.01151462142694028,False,

The development of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and optimization technology provides the opportunity to maximize the performance of hydro turbines. The optimization techniques are focused mainly on the rotating components (runner and guide vane) of the hydro turbines. Meanwhile, fixed flow passages (stay vane, casing, and draft tube) are essential parts for the proper flow uniformity in the hydro turbines. The suppression of flow instabilities in the fixed flow passages is an inevitable process to ensure the power plant safety by the reduction of vortex-induced vibration and pressure pulsation in the hydro turbines. In this study, a CFD-based shape design optimization process is proposed with response surface methodology (RSM) to improve the flow uniformity in the fixed flow passages of a Francis hydro turbine model. The internal flow behaviors were compared between the initial and optimal shapes of the stay vane, casing, and the draft tube with J-Groove. The optimal shape design process for the fixed flow passages proved its remarkable effects on the improvement of flow uniformity in the Francis hydro turbine.",Semantic Scholar,15.2380952380952,10.3390/pr8111392,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d99282feebca8044283bfd060c8fe67199bc2ca9,,,Goal 16,0.01600089941329689,False,

This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive halos. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realisations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z � 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z � 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for “anti-hierarchical” galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.",Semantic Scholar,20.0,10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10519.x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed68cd94410801d7971286ec3b7a6fe0a07bfe19,,,Goal 8,0.007172903274421546,False,

With the recent advancements in numerical modeling approaches, numerical simulation of wastewater jets as three-dimensional phenomena can be feasible. The present study deals with a fully three-dimensional numerical simulation for buoyant jets discharged from a rosette-type multiport diffuser, with the standard and re-normalization group (RNG) k-ε turbulence models. The simulated results are compared with experimental data, and the results show a good agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating that the numerical model is an efficient and effective tool for simulating rosette jet groups.

Multiphase Flow, vol. 133, 2020, 103462) to investigate the effect of turbulent fluid motions on the translation and rotation of lifting and wall-interacting spheres in boundary layers. Each sphere was released from rest in smooth-wall boundary layers with $Re_\tau =670$ and 1300 ($d^+=56$ and 116, respectively) and allowed to propagate with the incoming fluid. Sphere and surrounding fluid motions were tracked simultaneously via three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in streamwise–spanwise planes. Two-point correlations of sphere and fluid streamwise velocities yielded long positive regions associated with long fast- and slow-moving zones that approach and move over the spheres. The related spanwise correlations were shorter due to the shorter coherence length of spanwise fluid structures. In general, spheres lag the surrounding fluid. The less-dense lifting sphere had smaller particle Reynolds numbers varying from near zero up to 300. Its lift-offs coincided with oncoming fast-moving zones and fluid upwash. Wall friction initially retarded the acceleration of the denser sphere. Later, fluid torque associated with approaching high-velocity regions initiated forward rotation. The rotation, which was long-lived, induced sufficient Magnus lift to initiate repeated small lift-offs, reduce wall friction, and accelerate the sphere to higher sustained velocity. Particle Reynolds numbers remained above 200, and vortex shedding was omnipresent such that the spheres clearly altered the fluid motion. Spanwise fluid shear occasionally initiated wall-normal sphere rotation and relatively long-lasting Magnus side lift. Hence the finite sphere size contributed to multiple dynamical effects not present in point-particle models.",Semantic Scholar,15.5555555555556,10.1017/jfm.2024.291,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a066ada9c9fa2d1867ccbc4bca89c2b81a27ab4,,,Goal 13,0.00440277065549135,False,

We examine why managers who seek out voice at work might not always properly reward the behavior. Drawing on theories of dispositional attribution, we propose that, in general, managers tend to reward voice because it signals to them that employees possess a valued underlying trait: proactivity, which is characterized by change-orientation and foresight. However, we argue that when managers engage in more voice solicitation-that is, explicitly ask for voice and take a listening posture toward it-their tendency to infer proactivity from employees' voice weakens. Thus, we make a case that voice solicitation, a managerial behavior intended to set facilitating conditions for speaking up at work, inadvertently weakens the (indirect) relationship between employee voice and job rewards. We establish support for our theory in a set of two studies with complementary designs. Study 1 was a preregistered between-subjects experiment that used a realistic vignette design with an online panel of 592 working adults based in the United States.

This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive halos. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realisations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z � 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z � 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for “anti-hierarchical” galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.",Semantic Scholar,20.0,10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10519.x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed68cd94410801d7971286ec3b7a6fe0a07bfe19,,,Goal 8,0.007172903274421546,False,

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), its instruments, and support facilities. The 4 m aperture DKIST provides the highest-resolution observations of the Sun ever achieved. The large aperture of DKIST combined with state-of-the-art instrumentation provide the sensitivity to measure the vector magnetic field in the chromosphere and in the faint corona, i.e. for the first time with DKIST we will be able to measure and study the most important free-energy source in the outer solar atmosphere – the coronal magnetic field. Over its operational lifetime DKIST will advance our knowledge of fundamental astronomical processes, including highly dynamic solar eruptions that are at the source of space-weather events that impact our technological society. Design and construction of DKIST took over two decades. DKIST implements a fast (f/2), off-axis Gregorian optical design. The maximum available field-of-view is 5 arcmin. A complex thermal-control system was implemented in order to remove at prime focus the majority of the 13 kW collected by the primary mirror and to keep optical surfaces and structures at ambient temperature, thus avoiding self-induced local seeing. A high-order adaptive-optics system with 1600 actuators corrects atmospheric seeing enabling diffraction limited imaging and spectroscopy. Five instruments, four of which are polarimeters, provide powerful diagnostic capability over a broad wavelength range covering the visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectrum. New polarization-calibration strategies were developed to achieve the stringent polarization accuracy requirement of 5×10−4. Instruments can be combined and operated simultaneously in order to obtain a maximum of observational information. Observing time on DKIST is allocated through an open, merit-based proposal process. DKIST will be operated primarily in “service mode” and is expected to on average produce 3 PB of raw data per year. A newly developed data center located at the NSO Headquarters in Boulder will initially serve fully calibrated data to the international users community.

We explore dynamics of three major structural metrics of an economy. First, we show that an economic transition to relative decoupling of gross domestic product (GDP) from resource consumption is an expected pattern that occurs because of physical limits to growth, not a response to avoid physical limits. While increasing operational resource efficiency does increase the level of relative decoupling, so does a change in pricing from one based on full costs to one based only on marginal costs that neglect depreciation and interest payments. Marginal cost pricing leads to higher debt ratios and a perception of higher levels of relative resource decoupling. Second, if assuming full labor bargaining power for wages, when a previously-growing economy reaches peak resource extraction and GDP, wages remain high but profits and debt decline to zero. By removing bargaining power, profits can remain positive at the expense of declining wages. Third, the internal structure of HARMONEY evolves in the same way the post-World War II U.S. economy. This is measured as the distribution of intermediate transactions within the input-output tables of both the model and U.S. economy.",Crossref,100.0,10.1007/s41247-021-00093-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41247-021-00093-8,,,Goal 8,0.0544869219470959,True,Aid for Trade; GDP growth; economic growth; economic inequality; economic policies; economic recovery; employment; entrepreneurship; inclusive economic growth; labour market; resource efficiency

This study investigates the link between moisture flux and extreme rainfall over the west coast, using observational and reanalysis datasets for the monsoon seasons (June to September) from 1990 to 2023. The analysis shows that, over the Indian subcontinent, rainfall along the west coast is primarily influenced by large‐scale moisture flux from the Arabian Sea. By decomposing the vertically integrated moisture flux into dynamic and thermodynamic components, this study observes that the thermodynamic component of moisture flux exhibits an increasing trend over the southwest coast, while this increasing trend is more prominent for the dynamic component over the northwest coast. Extreme rainfall over the southwest coast is increasing at a rate of 0.23 mm per season, attributed primarily to the increase in the thermodynamic component of moisture flux. It is observed that the rate of sea surface temperature (SST) increase over the Arabian Sea is faster than over the Bay of Bengal, with the average SST over the southeast Arabian Sea exceeding 28°C in recent years. Observations indicate that warming over the southeast Arabian Sea is strongly coupled with moisture accumulation observed over the southwest coast. This study provides strong evidence of a link between moisture transport, extreme rainfall and SST, identifying the southwest coast as a region vulnerable to climate change. Over the northwest coast, the incidence of extreme rainfall is associated with the strengthening of dynamic processes, and the mean monsoon rainfall in this region is increasing in alignment with the rising dynamic component of moisture flux.",Semantic Scholar,31.4285714285714,10.1002/joc.8756,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6c8d40f30def682dce605497257c0ac51e14590,,,Goal 13,0.04005474499335855,False,climate-vulnerable regions

There is a range between two distinct phenotypes of ageing, shaped by patterns of living - experiences and behaviours, and in particular by the presence or absence of physical activity (PA) and structured exercise (i.e., a sedentary lifestyle). Ageing and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with declines in muscle function and cardiorespiratory fitness, resulting in an impaired capacity to perform daily activities and maintain independent functioning. However, in the presence of adequate exercise/PA these changes in muscular and aerobic capacity with age are substantially attenuated. Additionally, both structured exercise and overall PA play important roles as preventive strategies for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and obesity; improvement of mobility, mental health, and quality of life; and reduction in mortality, among other benefits. Notably, exercise intervention programmes improve the hallmarks of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, energy) and cognition, thus optimising functional capacity during ageing. In these pathological conditions exercise is used as a therapeutic agent and follows the precepts of identifying the cause of a disease and then using an agent in an evidence-based dose to eliminate or moderate the disease. Prescription of PA/structured exercise should therefore be based on the intended outcome (e.g., primary prevention, improvement in fitness or functional status or disease treatment), and individualised, adjusted and controlled like any other medical treatment. In addition, in line with other therapeutic agents, exercise shows a dose-response effect and can be individualised using different modalities, volumes and/or intensities as appropriate to the health state or medical condition. Importantly, exercise therapy is often directed at several physiological systems simultaneously, rather than targeted to a single outcome as is generally the case with pharmacological approaches to disease management. There are diseases for which exercise is an alternative to pharmacological treatment (such as depression), thus contributing to the goal of deprescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMS). There are other conditions where no effective drug therapy is currently available (such as sarcopenia or dementia), where it may serve a primary role in prevention and treatment. Therefore, this consensus statement provides an evidence-based rationale for using exercise and PA for health promotion and disease prevention and treatment in older adults. Exercise prescription is discussed in terms of the specific modalities and doses that have been studied in randomised controlled trials for their effectiveness in attenuating physiological changes of ageing, disease prevention, and/or improvement of older adults with chronic disease and disability. Recommendations are proposed to bridge gaps in the current literature and to optimise the use of exercise/PA both as a preventative medicine and as a therapeutic agent.",Semantic Scholar,10.1010101010101,10.1007/s12603-021-1665-8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f809c2d89134278a2753f357004ba508f57c1a5f,,,Goal 3,0.08170725566926997,True,disease prevention; healthy lifestyles

The global burden of cirrhosis associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased substantially in the past decade. In the Americas, the dominant cause of cirrhosis is shifting from viral hepatitis to NAFLD and alcohol-associated liver disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has set back progress in the elimination of HCV and hepatitis B virus, and most countries are not on track to meet the WHO viral hepatitis elimination targets. The focus of care should be shifted upstream towards primary prevention and early detection of liver disease to reduce the global burden of cirrhosis. In this Review, Huang et al. highlight global trends in the epidemiology of cirrhosis, including contributions of various aetiologies of liver disease, and consider what needs to be done to address projected increases in the burden of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in people with chronic liver disease worldwide. In 2019, cirrhosis was associated with 2.4% of global deaths. Owing to the rising prevalence of obesity and increased alcohol consumption on the one hand, and improvements in the management of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections on the other, the epidemiology and burden of cirrhosis are changing. In this Review, we highlight global trends in the epidemiology of cirrhosis, discuss the contributions of various aetiologies of liver disease, examine projections for the burden of cirrhosis, and suggest future directions to tackle this condition. Although viral hepatitis remains the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide, the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-associated cirrhosis are rising in several regions of the world. The global number of deaths from cirrhosis increased between 2012 and 2017, but age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) declined. However, the ASDR for NAFLD-associated cirrhosis increased over this period, whereas ASDRs for other aetiologies of cirrhosis declined.

Relative to human observers, these measures are overly sensitive to resampling of texture regions (e.g., replacing one patch of grass with another). Here, we develop the first full-reference image quality model with explicit tolerance to texture resampling. Using a convolutional neural network, we construct an injective and differentiable function that transforms images to multi-scale overcomplete representations. We demonstrate empirically that the spatial averages of the feature maps in this representation capture texture appearance, in that they provide a set of sufficient statistical constraints to synthesize a wide variety of texture patterns. We then describe an image quality method that combines correlations of these spatial averages (“texture similarity”) with correlations of the feature maps (“structure similarity”). The parameters of the proposed measure are jointly optimized to match human ratings of image quality, while minimizing the reported distances between subimages cropped from the same texture images. Experiments show that the optimized method explains human perceptual scores, both on conventional image quality databases, as well as on texture databases. The measure also offers competitive performance on related tasks such as texture classification and retrieval. Finally, we show that our method is relatively insensitive to geometric transformations (e.g., translation and dilation), without use of any specialized training or data augmentation.

To develop liposomes loaded with iodinated agents as nanosized CT/MRI bimodal contrast agents for monitoring liposome-mediated drug delivery.


Methods
Rhodamine-labeled iodixanol (VisipaqueTM)-loaded liposomes (IX-lipo) were prepared and tested for their properties as a diamagnetic CEST contrast agent in vitro. Mice bearing subcutaneous CT26 colon tumors were injected i.v. with 1 g/kg (535 mg iodine/kg) IX-lipo, and in vivo CT and CEST MR images were acquired on day 3. CT and CEST MR images were also acquired for tumor-bearing mice co-injected with IX-lipo and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α).


Results
In addition to CT contrast, IX-lipo exhibited a strong CEST contrast similar to its non-liposomal form, with a detectability of ~2 nM per liposome. Both CT imaging and CEST MRI showed that i.v. injection of IX-lipo resulted in a rim enhancement of CT26 tumors with a heterogeneous central distribution. In contrast, co-injection of TNF-α caused a significantly augmented CT/MRI contrast in the tumor center. The intratumoral biodistribution of IX-lipo correlated well to the rhodamine patterns observed with fluorescence microscopy.


Conclusions
We have developed a CT/MRI bimodal imaging approach for monitoring the delivery and biodistribution of liposomes by loading them with the clinically approved X-ray/CT contrast agent iodixanol. Our approach may be easily adapted for other-FDA approved iodinated agents and thus has great translational potential.",Semantic Scholar,40.0,10.21037/QIMS.2019.06.10,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25751c5a05fe89672c964254bbd050b32d3b6b44,,,Goal 17,0.004143017134712684,False,

The SC is particularly suitable for estimating ATE with a single (or a few) treated unit(s), a fixed number of control units, and large pre and post-treatment periods (which we refer as “long panels”). To date, there has been no formal inference theory for SC ATE estimator with long panels under general conditions. Existing work mostly use placebo tests for inference or some permutation methods when the post-treatment period is small. In this article, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the SC and modified synthetic control (MSC) ATE estimators using projection theory. We show that a properly designed subsampling method can be used to obtain confidence intervals and conduct inference whereas the standard bootstrap cannot.

Additionally, social features can increase the demand for all apps when these are introduced along with less common intrinsic features.

If two firms are economically dependent through a supply chain relationship and if information related to both firms diffuses in the market slowly or rapidly, then our ability to predict stock returns increases or decreases, respectively. We use online cosearches of stock as a proxy for the extent of information diffusion across supply chain-related firms. We identify publicly traded supply chain partners using Bloomberg data and construct cosearch networks of supply chain partners based on the weekly coviewing pattern of these firms on Yahoo! Finance.

Ashish Agarwal,,2017,,"There is an increasing attention in information systems to be able to predict outcomes using search frequency on popular portals. This growing literature focuses on revealing demand patterns of individual assets (e.g., products, stocks, services). However, users typically search many different assets together (e.g., correlated searches) and leave a digital footprint, which can help provide insights on the behaviors of a group of assets. Furthermore, such group behavior can be used to predict outcomes (e.g., demand, stock returns) in the future. We analyze the underlying behavior of distinct subnetworks formed by correlated user searches for multiple items in the stock market and use such information for return prediction. Using cosearch data for stocks from Yahoo! Finance, we find 50–79 search clusters representing 230–349 stocks among Russell 3000 stocks at different time periods. These clusters reveal interesting habitats where the returns of stocks within a cluster tend to comove after controlling for known determinants of comovement. When a stock enters (departs) a cluster, the focal stock return comoves (detaches) with the cluster returns.

We argue that the direct network effects of complementors' products play a central role in the platform management by its owner. We test our predictions using data on the Apple's promotion of apps. We find that apps with network effects are more likely to receive an award. This likelihood increases when the app is introduced by a developer with a larger market share but declines when introduced in a concentrated segment. The likelihood decreases further if the app is introduced in a concentrated segment by a developer that holds a larger market share. Further, we observe that in concentrated segments, the “challenger” developer has a higher likelihood of receiving the award relative to the leader. Managerial Summary Many products offered through platforms have their own direct network effects. The value of the product for each user grows with the number of other consumers using the product. Many platform owners also actively manage their platforms to ensure platform growth and often use less traditional tools such as product endorsements to achieve this goal. In the context of video games listed in the iOS App Store and the Editors' Choice Awards as a form of product endorsement, we examine the tradeoffs that products with direct network effects (i.e., multiplayer video games) present to the platform owner (Apple). On the one hand, the platform owner may want to promote apps with direct network effects to help them achieve a momentum in terms of user growth. On the other hand, networked apps may become dominant in the segment with negative implications for future growth of the segment and the platform owner's profitability. We find evidence consistent with this tension and find that it critically depends on the complementor strength and market segment concentration.

In this paper, we broaden the locus of complementarities to examine the role of complementary technologies residing in the business ecosystems that are becoming an important source of value creation for innovating firms. We argue that, on one hand, complementary technologies help innovations create more value for their users. On the other hand, they can also limit the focal innovation’s value creation by exposing them to performance bottlenecks as the underlying technological architecture of the ecosystem evolves. We further extend the notion of specialization of complementary assets to ecosystems by considering complementary technologies that are specialized to a focal ecosystem and those that are available across multiple ecosystems. We highlight that, although the complementary technologies that are specialized to an ecosystem facilitate greater value creation, they are more likely to subject the focal innovation to performance bottlenecks.

The structural feature, which we refer to as ecosystem complexity, is a function of the number of unique components or subsystems that interact with the complementor’s product.

Our study builds a model that simulates the mutual, dynamic interaction of these stakeholders with each other and with processes with different characteristics in the presence of endogenous management prioritization. We build confidence in the model by calibrating it to data from PI teams at several family medicine clinics at a large US Midwestern healthcare system. The computational experiments performed using data from these teams yield several important insights for theory and practice. First, we find that process metrics, which are leading metrics related to the day-to-day functioning of the units, and outcome metrics, which are lagging metrics often tied to the unit's bottom line, are both critical for the functioning of the PI teams. Emphasizing one over the other can reduce sustainability while a mixed case in which one group of employees is incentivized to leading and another group to lagging can create a regime that is more effective in many scenarios. Second, we find that management interventions that improve short-term PI gains generally also reduce the likelihood of long-run sustainment. Third, we find that attrition and turnover among the team members affect sustainability of PI initiatives and reducing turnover for one class of employee, which attends lagging metrics, facilitates sustainment while reducing it for the other class, which attends leading metrics, can hinder sustainment.

Edward Anderson,,2023,,"ABSTRACT Multi-sided platforms must make decisions on both pricing and engineering investment and must continually adjust them as the platform scales over its lifecycle. Engineering investments can be allocated to features that improve a platform’s standalone value, social features to take advantage of same-side network effects, or integration tools and boundary resources to facilitate third-party content creation. Guidance in the academic or practitioner literature is not granular. Moreover, relevant normative economic models that consider externalities are rarely dynamic. Hence, there is a gap in knowledge about how to best balance tradeoffs between different strategic decisions throughout the entire platform lifecycle. To begin to address this gap, we explore normative strategies for coordinating pricing and engineering investment decisions on a continuous basis under different ecosystem conditions. We build a simulation model informed by economics and marketing theory and perform extensive sensitivity analyses on key parameters in different ecosystem scenarios over a multi-period lifecycle. We find that pricing and investment strategies must continuously change to perform optimally. In particular, strategies that are most effective at launch often differ from those that are most effective during scaling as well as those most effective at maturity. We also find that the optimal strategy depends strongly on the monetization model and market aversion to price changes. Lastly, we specifically examine four different industry segments: mobile platforms, social media, the sharing economy, and business-to-business.

Researchers have employed one such systems approach, system dynamics, successfully for decades for studying OM problems in public policy because it can address such complexity and can also integrate disciplines from outside OM such as political science, epidemiology, ecology, etc. In this paper, we create a roadmap for researchers—both those who are familiar with systems dynamics and those who are not—for the expanded use of system dynamics studying public policy‐related OM problems. We review and organize relevant system dynamics literature in both traditional operations management venues as well as public policy venues unfamiliar to OM audiences . We then identify a set of interesting open questions and potential system dynamics building blocks for answering them by topic. Leveraging this review, we describe under what conditions system dynamics is most appropriate. We then identify several overarching methodological and domain gaps for future research. Finally, we build on previous work to extend a process for using system dynamics with traditional operations management methodologies. It separates model building into two sequential phases: consensus‐building models and detailed operational models. It also incorporates scenario planning and feedback from implementation outcomes.",Crossref,91.358024691358,10.1111/poms.13947,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13947,,,Goal 11,0.02034677880132171,False,

Edward Anderson,,2020,,"Many two-sided platforms, such as eBay, iOS, Android, and Twitter, invest in developer integration tools, such as modular interfaces, interactive development environments, application programming interfaces, and help desks, in order to reduce the cost and improve the functionality of third-party content developed for the platform. Although these integration tools are crucial to platform success, they are costly to create, and therefore, managers need to understand where and when to deploy them. In particular, when the necessary integration investment is high, the advice to subsidize one side of a two-sided market while charging the other may not hold. This means that integration investment should be carefully coordinated with market pricing decisions. In general, higher levels of investment by hardware/software platforms into integration become desirable when the platform (1) has access to a large pool of content providers and consumers, (2) is able to develop integration tools that are highly effective in reducing third-party development costs, and (3) operates in high-consumer value markets. However, there are nuances. For example, business to business platforms can make investments in integration to facilitate participation by both sides of the market.

Edward Anderson,,2019,,"Firms in advanced economies are increasingly outsourcing software and technology development as well as other knowledge work to a worldwide supply base. Standard economic and learning models predict that focal firms should outsource either all or none of a particular activity unless extra resources are required during cyclical demand peaks or access is needed to some tightly appropriable intellectual property. However, recent evidence shows that, even when these exceptions do not apply, many firms pursue a partial outsourcing strategy. We develop a dynamic optimization model to provide a rational explanation for this observation. In our model, learning from prior projects occurs at both the subsystem level and the overall systems level (e.g., systems integration and architecture). Learning at the two levels interacts such that integration capabilities can dynamically build and decay. The model generates conditions where partial outsourcing is rational and dominates the extreme conditions of complete insourcing or complete outsourcing. Our model also specifies the conditions for regime change between insourcing and outsourcing and cycling between insourcing and outsourcing, and overshooting or undershooting the long‐run outsourcing target. Furthermore, we show that these results are highly path‐dependent under short horizons. The model also provides explanation for interesting questions such as why the rate of outsourcing might be U‐shaped in the rate of technological change and why startups so often insource in contrast to more established counterparts in similar industries.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12898,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12898,,,Goal 9,0.01931019132238971,False,

Edward Anderson,,2018,,"Distributed product development projects encompass product and process development activities that span organizational and country boundaries. The increasing trend toward globalizing projects requires firms to coordinate development efforts made by team members from various functions within the firm, speaking multiple languages, and working in various time zones. We analyze qualitative data from 70 distributed product development projects that span 14 countries and involve cross-functional team members speaking 10 different languages. We find that commonly discussed integration strategies such as modular product designs and colocating team members by themselves are insufficient to coordinate project work. Rather, our field interviews suggest that firms invest in design information systems (DIS) with specific features to facilitate product design and empower their project managers to integrate the development efforts. Specifically, our interviews suggest that firms often modify the organization by “unifying” the engineering and purchasing functions into a single supply chain integrator function to increase the scope of responsibilities for these managers. We then test our hypotheses on the benefits of these strategies on project outcomes by using survey data from 55 distributed product development projects in 20 firms. Results indicate that the use of DIS is associated with higher quality and relationship performance when there are differences between focal and supplier firm personnel languages. Unifying engineering and purchasing functions into a supply chain integrator is associated with improved response time in the presence of time zone differences. We also find that a unifying strategy is associated with lower cost in the presence of language differences, but is also associated with a worsening of response time. These results provide guidance to product designers in organizations that must coordinate complex work across time zone barriers and languages. The results also provide guidance to researchers, by showing that different integration mechanisms may have differential effects across various coordination barriers and across multiple dimensions of project performance.

Drawing on a nationwide sample of U.S. hospitals collected from 2008 to 2019, we utilise data envelopment analysis to measure hospital performance and the Malmquist index to evaluate their longitudinal trends. Although average hospital productivity and value improved since the rollout of the P4P programs, we observe that a large proportion of laggard hospitals were unable to catch up with improvements to the performance frontier, raising concerns about disparities in the impact of future value-based programs. Our analyses also indicate that horizontal integration across hospitals is associated with greater productivity and value. While greater physician-hospital (vertical) integration is associated with higher hospital productivity, it does not have a positive impact on value.

Although a decade has passed, the value of care delivered by ACOs is yet to be fully understood. We proposed a novel measure of health care value using data envelopment analysis and examined its association with ACO organizational characteristics and social determinants of health (SDOH). We observed that the value of care delivered by ACOs stagnated in recent years, which may be partially attributed to challenges in care continuity and coordination across providers. ACOs that were solely led by physicians and included more participating entities exhibited lower value, highlighting the role of coordination across ACO networks. Furthermore, SDOH factors, such as economic well-being, healthy food consumption, and access to health resources, were significant predictors of ACO value. Our findings suggest a “skinny in scale, broad in scope” approach for ACOs to improve the value of care.

However, the impact of PQRS on physicians is unclear, particularly as related to their online reputation. Is there an association between a physician’s online reputation and her adherence to clinical guidelines stipulated in the PQRS? Is online reputation associated with use of electronic health records (EHR)? To investigate these questions, we combine data on online physician reviews with the PQRS data on clinical guideline adherence and EHR use. Unlike prior research, which primarily uses clinical outcomes as proxies for care quality, our study uses adherence to clinical guidelines, a process measure that reflects physician conformance with evidence-based clinical practices. In addition, we focus on EHR use at the physician level, in contrast to the usual approach of examining it at the aggregate institutional level. Consistent with the economic theory of credence goods, we observe no significant relationship between physicians’ adherence to clinical guidelines and their online reviews. Although there is some evidence of association between EHR use and their overall rating, similar relationships are not consistently observed for individual dimensional ratings. Overall, the online reputation of a physician exhibits minimal association with her actual clinical activities — and is mostly driven by latent topics in the textual reviews — implying that the ability of online reviews to inform prospective patients of care quality might be quite limited. Therefore, patients should be cautious when using online physician reviews, and policymakers should increase the accessibility of PQRS and other similar data to help patients make informed physician choices.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1080/07421222.2019.1661093,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d917ce2db72ac13e6b7f41a710c718846be05967,,,Goal 3,0.0193914713483945,False,
Indranil Bardhan,,2018,,"Adequate length of stay (LOS) during hospitalization is not only a critical determinant of quality of care, but can be a useful predictor of the risk of future readmissions. Recent studies have shown alarming evidence that the United States leads developed nations in terms of shorter hospital stays, rendering patients with greater risk of future readmissions. We focus on deviation between hospital LOS and the geometric mean LOS (GMLOS), a guideline for care delivery stipulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Our objective is to establish the relationship between LOS and readmission risk, examine the role of health IT in reducing the deviation of LOS, and address cost trade‐offs between early discharges and readmissions. Based on a large panel of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients during a 4‐year period, we find that implementation of health IT applications is associated with a reduction in the deviation between LOS and GMLOS. This deviation is associated with a significant increase in future 30‐day readmission risk. Patients whose inpatient stays are shorter than the GMLOS guideline, by 1 day or more, are likely to exhibit a 1.1% greater risk of readmission, and even shorter stays are likely to further exacerbate their readmission risk.

Indranil Bardhan,,2017,,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate the determinants of health outcomes of dialysis patients, while specifically focusing on the role of dialysis process measures and dialysis practice characteristics. The dialysis industry is facing a major transition from a volume-based health care system to a value-based cost-efficient care model, in the USA. Under the bundled Prospective Payment System, the treatment-based payment model is subject to meeting quality thresholds as defined by clinical process measures including dialysis adequacy and anemia management. Few studies have focused on studying these two processes and their association with the quality of patient health outcomes. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors focus on identifying the determinants of patient health outcomes among freestanding dialysis clinics, using a large cross-sectional data set of 4,571 dialysis clinics in the USA. The authors use econometric analyses to estimate the association between dialysis facility characteristics and practice patterns and their association with dialysis process measures and hospitalization risk. Findings The authors find that reusing dialyzers and increasing the number of dialysis stations is associated with higher levels of clinical quality. This research indicates that deploying more nurses on-site allows patients to avail adequate dialysis, while increasing the supply of physicians can hurt anemia control process. In addition, the authors report that offering peritoneal dialysis and late night shifts are not beneficial practices in terms of their impact on the hospitalization risk. Research limitations/implications While early studies of dialysis care mainly focused on the associations between practice patterns and patient outcomes, this research reveals the underlying mechanisms of these relationships by exploring the mediation effects of clinical dialysis processes on patient outcomes. The results indicate that dialysis process measures mediate the impact of the operational characteristics of dialysis centers on patient hospitalization rates. Practical implications This study offers several managerial insights for owners and operators of dialysis clinics with respect to the association between managerial and clinical practices that they deploy within dialysis clinics and their impact on clinical quality measures as well as hospitalization risk of patients. Managers can draw on this study to optimize staffing levels in their dialysis clinics, and implement innovative clinical practices. Social implications Considering the growth in healthcare expenditures in developing and developed countries, and specifically for costly diagnoses such as dialyses, this study offers several insights related to the inter-relationships between dialysis practice patterns and their clinical quality measures. Originality/value This study makes several major contributions. First, the authors address the extant gap in the literature on the relationships between dialysis facility and practice characteristics and clinical outcomes, while specifically highlighting the role of clinical process measures as antecedents of patient hospitalization ratio, a key metric used to measure performance of dialysis clinics. Second, this study sheds light on the underlying mechanisms that serve as enablers of the dialysis adequacy and anemia management.

Indranil Bardhan,,2015,,"Mitigating preventable readmissions, where patients are readmitted for the same primary diagnosis within 30 days, poses a significant challenge to the delivery of high-quality healthcare. Toward this end, we develop a novel, predictive analytics model, termed as the beta geometric Erlang-2 (BG/EG) hurdle model, which predicts the propensity, frequency, and timing of readmissions of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur. We test our model using a unique data set that tracks patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data across 67 hospitals in North Texas over a four-year period. We show that our model provides superior predictive performance compared to extant models such as the logit, BG/NBD hurdle, and EG hurdle models. Our model also allows us to study the association between hospital usage of health information technologies (IT) and readmission risk. We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions. Our results indicate that patient profiles derived from our model can serve as building blocks for a predictive analytics system to identify CHF patients with high readmission risk.",Crossref,79.0960451977401,10.1287/isre.2014.0553,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2014.0553,,,Goal 3,0.03919205508231359,False,
Nathan Barrymore,,2021,,"Abstract Research Summary Career paths depend not only on individuals' own competitiveness but also on the competitiveness of others in a position to advocate for them. In this article, we study competitiveness when rewards accrue to another individual. In particular, we ask how female and male managers' competitiveness changes when rewards from competition accrue to their female or male protégés, relative to when they accrue to themselves. Using an experimental approach, we find that when rewards accrue to protégés, male and female managers are equally competitive because female managers increase their competitiveness. However, male managers compete more for male rather than female protégés. This gap disappears when male managers know their protégés' risk preferences, suggesting a novel intervention to ensure equity in the sponsorship process. Managerial Summary Sponsorship is key to individuals' career development and firms' human capital strategy. In this experimental study simulating an organizational setting, we investigate one aspect of sponsorship and ask whether managers' and protégés' genders affect managers' willingness to compete on behalf of their protégés. We find that when the rewards from competition accrue to protégés, female managers increase their competitiveness and eliminate the gender competitiveness gap present when rewards accrue to managers themselves. This suggests that, from a competitiveness standpoint, female and male managers are equally strong sponsors. However, male managers compete more for male, relative to female, protégés. This gap disappears when male managers have information about protégés' risks preferences, suggesting a novel approach that organizations can implement to reduce discrimination in sponsorship.",Crossref,92.8571428571429,10.1002/smj.3353,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3353,,,Goal 5,0.02873503643122528,False,

In this study, we seek to understand how uncertainties introduced by third-party services shape enterprise customers’ use of various IT services in these multivendor service settings. Specifically, we analyze a case of disruption caused by a third party that affects the multivendor service but does not directly affect the first-party services. We find a temporary increase in the use of first-party services that serve as similar-goal substitutes during the disruption; however, there is a net decline in the total use of services in the long run. To assess what actions the first party can take during such disruptions to turn the challenge into an opportunity, we analyze the first party’s technical support log using deep learning techniques. We find that if the first party offers high-quality technical support that addresses product-related issues, it may be able to make lemonade out of lemons. Such technical support effectively boosts customers’ use of first-party services in the long run.

We evaluate the effect of social and nonsocial or intrinsic features on the demand for apps on the iOS platform. Our findings suggest that only niche apps can increase their demand by incorporating social features. We also find that social features that allow sharing on platforms with large audiences and stronger ties among users, such as Facebook, are most effective. Additionally, social features can increase the demand for all apps when these are introduced along with less common intrinsic features. However, low-quality niche apps should refrain from sharing information about such features on platforms with low tie strength, as this may hurt the demand.

Anitesh Barua,,2021,,"Aided by the increasing ease of use, lower adoption cost, and higher network benefits, consumers are demonstrating a strong propensity to concurrently use competing firms’ products or services. Depending on their relative preference for a firm, such “multi-homing” consumers may adopt each firm partially and therefore contribute to the network benefits of no firm fully, as would be the case with single-homing. Consumers’ level of adoption of competing products is a key feature of multi-homing, which, while observed widely in practice, has not previously been studied in the literature. Through a series of analytical models, we demonstrate the important role of this construct in the pricing and capability-related decisions of competing firms. Our results provide several new insights, which suggest that as multi-homing (M) settings become common across industries, technology strategists and managers should exercise caution against simply extrapolating insights from single-homing (S) settings, where consumers adopt only one firm, or from M settings, where the level of adoption is not accounted for. Specifically, in markets where competing products are not well differentiated, contrary to intuition, we find that under price competition, a firm’s profit can be hurt by high levels of adoption by multi-homing consumers; further, in markets where prices are inflexible, a firm with a higher level of adoption can succeed even with a lower level of capability innovation relative to that of an S setting. In contrast to single-homing settings, we show that firms in M settings need to mitigate uncertainty regarding network benefits if the level of adoption is low. Finally, we explore the role of adoption level in two-sided markets and demonstrate that if one side does not have a strong preference for a platform, then, contrary to prevailing wisdom, the latter need not strongly subsidize the other side of the market.",Crossref,100.0,10.25300/misq/2021/15416,https://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2021/15416,,,Goal 9,0.01062036696635259,False,

Anitesh Barua,,2018,,"The widespread use of announcement period returns to assess the financial impact of information technology (IT) events implicitly assumes that the market can completely price IT investments during the announcement period. However, some studies in strategy and information systems have suggested that long-term abnormal returns may be a more appropriate measure of the value of IT events. To reconcile these streams of research, we develop and test an exploratory framework involving the maturity and scope of an IT event to assess the suitability of short-versus long-term abnormal returns. We conceptualize event maturity in terms of diffusion of the technology or phenomenon, and scope as the extent of complementary organizational changes that need to be implemented and managed. We posit that because of lack of widespread knowledge of best practices and cases of success and failure in a period of low technological maturity, the market may find it difficult to price such an event completely during the announcement period. Similarly, the challenge of acquiring and interpreting information on a firm’s capability to manage wide scope of change may be an impediment to pricing high-scope events. We test our framework using a sample of 642 large outsourcing contracts and 1,700 electronic commerce initiatives. We empirically demonstrate that announcement period returns are indeed a complete measure of event value for cases characterized by high maturity and low scope; however, long-term abnormal returns are realized for events involving low maturity and/or high scope, which questions the validity of announcement period returns.

Using a life‐cycle framework incorporating wealth levels, bequest motives, and consumption floors created by government subsidies, we examine how increased longevity in conjunction with an individual's health state transition process impacts annuity purchase decisions. Health state transition matrices are estimated from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) data. The effects of increased longevity on annuitization decisions are considered when longevity is both accompanied by increased time spent in healthier states (morbidity compression) or experienced by more time in unhealthy states (morbidity expansion). We find that retirees’ annuity demand is affected by wealth, initial health status, and expansion or compression of morbidity. Wealthier retirees have higher annuity demand when health shocks are considered, and increased longevity increases demand even more when retirees expect an expansion or slight morbidity compression. With health shocks and expectations of severe morbidity compression considered, the opposite effect might occur. Thus, an annuity can help retirees hedge health shock costs when slight compression or expansion of morbidity occurs.

This research presents the results of collaboration with industry conducted by a university at the request of its state legislature. The purpose was to see the viability and validity of the use of credit scoring to predict insurance losses given its controversial nature and criticism as redundant of other predictive variables currently used. Working with industry and government, this study analyzed more than 175,000 policyholders’ information for the relationship between credit score and claims. Credit scores were significantly related to incurred losses, evidencing both statistical and practical significance. We investigate whether the revealed relationship between credit score and incurred losses was explainable by overlap with existing underwriting variables or whether the credit score adds new information about losses not contained in existing underwriting variables. The results show that credit scores contain significant information not already incorporated into other traditional rating variables (e.g., age, sex, driving history). We discuss how sensation seeking and self-control theory provide a partial explanation of why credit scoring works (the psycho-social perspective).

Keith Brown,,2020,,"The past 15 years have seen the emergence of large infusions of private capital at levels previously accessible only in public markets. One direct effect of these non‐public fundraisings is the spawning of private entities with market valuations reaching $1 billion, thereby achieving the status of unicorns. As the authors reported in an earlier study, by the end of 2015, there were 142 unicorns with an aggregate value exceeding $500 billion. The conviction of many investors and managers at that time was that these companies could best create value by staying private, often by adopting governance structures focused on creating superior operating performance. It was also widely believed that unicorns would remain outside the public markets longer and succeed in attracting even more private capital, thereby enabling their investors to capture a greater share of the increase in company value. In this study, the authors examine how the characteristics and dynamics of “the blessing” have changed in the past five years. Despite the widespread view that the valuations and private financing trend fueling this market were not sustainable, the authors report that by March 2020, the “net” number of unicorns had grown from 142 to 464, a number that doesn't reflect the transformation of over half of the 2015 sample through acquisition or public offering and their replacement by new unicorns. Further, the cumulative market valuation of unicorns more than doubled from $500 billion to $1.37 trillion, representing growth far greater than that in the public equity markets (some 26% per annum, as compared to 9% for the S&P 500) over the same period—and the blessing has become more diversified, both in terms of industry and geographical location. The authors also consider what happens when unicorns “graduate” to a different organizational form by means of an IPO, private buyout, or business failure. Analyzing the 107 firms that departed the sample between 2015 and 2020, the authors report that the average lifespan of a unicorn from its founding date to its exit date has been 9.5 years, indicating that such firms indeed remain privately owned for a longer time than in the past. Additionally, the study finds that the founders and initial investors in unicorns have fared quite well, cashing out their initial investment at almost six times invested capital, on average. These private investment performance metrics have been significantly higher than the returns to public shareholders in the same firms during the post‐IPO period, signifying that unicorn investors have captured much more of the value created in the company's growth phase than public stockholders.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/jacf.12418,https://doi.org/10.1111/jacf.12418,,,Goal 17,0.03465807687767752,False,

Keith Brown,,2016,,"In a recent article in this journal, the authors documented the growing tendency of emerging growth companies to raise substantial equity while remaining privately held through private IPOs, or PIPOs. PIPO financing has created scores of “unicorn” firms—private enterprises with imputed market values of $1.0 billion or more—while allowing them to avoid the challenges of being publicly traded. But as has also been noted, the PIPO process, with its multiple financing rounds and increasingly complex terms, has almost certainly result in some inflated market valuations. Along with inflated values, the contracting process and many of the provisions that result from it often have economic consequences that are poorly understood by at least some of the participants, including the potential for significant wealth transfer between stakeholders as well as overall destruction of enterprise value. And the term sheets containing such provisions appear to become even more “opaque” and more “toxic” with each round of financing. More specifically, the liquidation preferences and ratchets often provided new investors in the later rounds of PIPOs can greatly affect the allocation of the risks and the ownership shares and, in so doing, transfer significant wealth from the entrepreneurs and other older owners. Using a numerical analysis of a representative term sheet, the authors discuss the process of financial contracting for early‐stage companies, providing examples of how negotiations can go wrong and showing exactly when and where the agreed‐upon conditions start to turn toxic for some of the stakeholders. The article closes with the authors’ assessment of the disincentives for entrepreneurs and early‐stage investors created by this often confusing and dilutive venture capital contracting and funding process.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/jacf.12160,https://doi.org/10.1111/jacf.12160,,,Goal 17,0.0244676750219445,False,
Christopher Bryan,,2023,,"Abstract Educational outcomes remain highly unequal within and across nations. Students’ mindsets—their beliefs about whether intellectual abilities can be developed—have been identified as a potential lever for making adolescents’ academic outcomes more equitable. Recent research, however, suggests that intervention programs aimed at changing students’ mindsets should be supplemented by programs aimed at the changing the mindset culture , which is defined as the shared set of beliefs about learning in a school or classroom. This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical origin of the mindset culture and examines its potential to reduce group-based inequalities in education. In particular, experiments have identified two broad ways the mindset culture is communicated by teachers: via informal messages about growth (e.g., that all students will be helped to learn and succeed), and formal opportunities to improve (e.g., learning-focused grading policies and opportunities to revise and earn credit). New field experiments, applying techniques from behavioral science, have also revealed effective ways to influence teachers’ culture-creating behaviors.

We examine three psychological barriers to the responsible use of credit and debt. We discuss the tendency for consumers to (a) make erroneous predictions about future spending habits, (b) rely too heavily on values presented on billing statements, and (c) categorize debt and saving into separate mental accounts. To overcome these obstacles, we urge policymakers to implement methods that facilitate better budgeting of future expenses, modify existing credit card statement disclosures, and allow consumers to easily apply government transfers (such as tax credits) to debt repayment.

We introduce an agency perspective on voice by theorizing that one fundamental reason why employees speak up is to generate the implementation of corrective action for issues affecting themselves and to the extent targets of voice have agency to facilitate action through implementation of voice, voicing employees should be more likely to realize performance benefits from speaking up.

John Butler,,2016,,"Abstract Matching supply and demand can be very challenging for anyone attempting to provide goods or services during the threat of a natural disaster. In this paper, we consider inventory allocation issues faced by a retailer during a hurricane event and provide insights that can be applied to humanitarian operations during slow‐onset events. We start with an empirical analysis using regression that triangulates three sources of information: a large point‐of‐sales data set from a Texas Gulf Coast retailer, the retailer's operational and logistical constraints, and hurricane forecast data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). We establish a strong association between the timing of the hurricane weather forecast, the forecasted landfall position of the storm, and hurricane sales. Storm intensity is found to have a weaker association on overall inventory decisions. Using the results of the empirical analysis and the NHC forecast data, we construct a state‐space model of demand during the threat of a hurricane and develop an inventory management model to satisfy consumer demand prior to a hurricane making landfall. Based on the structure of the problem, we model this situation as a two‐stage, two‐location inventory allocation model from a centralized distribution center that balances transportation, shortage and holding costs. The model is used to explore the role of recourse, i.e., deferring part of the inventory allocation until observing the state of the hurricane as it moves towards landfall. Our approach provides valuable insights into the circumstances under which recourse may or may not be worthwhile in any setting where an anticipated extreme event drives consumer demand.",Crossref,91.4634146341463,10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jom.2016.05.006,,,Goal 17,0.008363878952946465,False,

Instead, digital entrepreneurs now pursue locations that provide more opportunities for funding (rounds) and greater social network support. Analyzing data for entrepreneurial ventures that were successful in receiving some external funding, we found that the number of funding rounds per year plays a significant and positive role in influencing start-up creation in that location—interestingly, amount of funding does not. Furthermore, local social network density creates stickiness to that location, thus negatively influencing entrepreneurs' willingness to relocate. If entrepreneurs do relocate to create a start-up after a short delay, larger social network density (in a new location) positively affects start-up creation decision in that location. Additionally, we find that midcareer individuals (such as millennials) are more likely than early-career or late-career stage individuals to create a successful technology start-up. Also, entrepreneurs are less likely to relocate for an Internet-based start-up but are likely to move if they have larger social network density in the new location.

Junyu Cao,,2024,,"Due to the sheer number of available choices, online retailers frequently use tiered assortment to present products. In this case, groups of products are arranged across multiple pages or stages, and a customer clicks on “next” or “load more” to access them sequentially. Despite the prevalence of such assortments in practice, this topic has not received much attention in the existing literature. In this work, we focus on a sequential choice model that captures customers’ behavior when product recommendations are presented in tiers. We analyze multiple variants of tiered assortment optimization (TAO) problems by imposing “no-duplication” and capacity constraints. For the offline setting involving known customers’ preferences, we characterize the properties of the optimal tiered assortment and propose algorithms that improve the computational efficiency over the existing benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the online setting of the TAO problem. A unique characteristic of our online setting, absent from the one-tier MNL bandit, is partial feedback. Products in the lower priority tiers are not shown when a customer has purchased a product or has chosen to exit at an earlier tier. Such partial feedback, along with product interdependence across tiers, increases the learning complexity. For both the noncontextual and contextual problems, we propose online algorithms and quantify their respective regrets. Moreover, we are able to construct tighter uncertainty sets for model parameters in the contextual case and thus improve the performance.

Junyu Cao,,2024,,"Problem definition: We consider intertemporal pricing in the presence of reference effects and consumer heterogeneity. Our research question encompasses how to estimate heterogeneous consumer reference effects from data and how to efficiently compute the optimal pricing policy. Academic/practical relevance: Understanding reference effects is essential for designing pricing policies in modern retailing. Our work contributes to this area by incorporating consumer heterogeneity under arbitrary distributions. Methodology: We propose a mixed logit demand model that allows arbitrary joint distributions of valuations, responsiveness to prices, and responsiveness to reference prices among consumers. We use a nonparametric estimation method to learn consumer heterogeneity from transaction data. Further, we formulate the pricing optimization as an infinite horizon dynamic programming problem and solve it by applying a modified policy iteration algorithm. Results: Moreover, we investigate the structure of optimal pricing policies and prove the suboptimality of constant pricing policies even when all consumers are loss-averse according to the classical definition. Our numerical studies show that our estimation and optimization framework improves the expected revenue of retailers via accounting for heterogeneity. We validate our model using real data from JD.com, a large E-commerce retailer, and find empirical evidence of consumer heterogeneity.

Users may leave the platform at any time, and the probability of exiting is higher when they do not like the content. Based on user's feedback, the platform learns the relevance of the underlying content as well as the discounting effect due to content fatigue.

Here, we create a novel mechanistic framework for understanding and predicting how sleep changes during ontogeny (why babies sleep twice as long as adults) and across phylogeny (why mice sleep roughly five times that of whales). We use this theory to quantitatively distinguish between sleep used for neural reorganization versus repair. We conduct a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of human sleep using total sleep time, cerebral metabolic rate, brain size, synaptic density, and REM sleep (used here to also refer to Active Sleep in infants and children). Our findings reveal an abrupt transition, between 2 and 3 years of age in humans. Specifically, our results show that differences in sleep across phylogeny and during late ontogeny (after 2 or 3 years in humans) are primarily due to sleep functioning for repair or clearance, while changes in sleep during early ontogeny (before 2 - 3 years in humans) primarily support neural reorganization and learning. Moreover, our analysis shows that neuroplastic reorganization occurs primarily in REM sleep but not in NREM. In accordance with the developmental role of neuroplasticity, the percent of time spent in REM sleep is independent of brain size across species but decreases dramatically as brain size grows through development. Furthermore, the ratio of NREM sleep time to awake time emerges as a new invariant across development.

Deepayan Chakrabarti,,2025,,"Graph anomaly detection has gained significant research interest across various domains. Due to the lack of labeled data, contrastive learning has been applied in detecting anomalies and various contrastive strategies have been initiated. However, these methods might force two instances (e.g., node-level and subgraph-level representations) with different category labels to be consistent during model training, which can adversely impact the model robustness. Also, they extract node-level representations only based on node attributes, which are inadequate in reflecting the information of the structural anomaly. To tackle this problem, we present a Graph-enhanced multi-scale Contrastive Learning framework for Anomaly Detection, GCLAD.

But dimensionality reduction loses information, while regularization requires the user to choose a norm, or a prior, or a distance metric. We propose an algorithm called RoLin that needs no user choice and applies to a large class of loss functions. RoLin combines “reliable” information from the top principal components with a robust optimization to extract any useful information from “unreliable” subspaces. It also includes a new robust cross-validation that is better than existing cross-validation methods in the limited-data setting.

In each iteration, SURE identifies high-risk zones in feature space where the risk of unfair classification is statistically significant. By changing the loss function's weights for points from these zones, SURE builds a fair classifier. The emphasis on statistical significance makes SURE robust to noise.

Existing provably consistent algorithms often require strong assumptions about the population, are computationally expensive, and only provide an overall error bound for the whole community membership matrix. This article provides uniform rates of convergence for the inferred community membership vector of each node in a network generated from the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB); to our knowledge, this is the first work to establish per-node rates for overlapping community detection in networks. We achieve this by establishing sharp row-wise eigenvector deviation bounds for MMSB. Based on the simplex structure inherent in the eigen-decomposition of the population matrix, we build on established corner-finding algorithms from the optimization community to infer the community membership vectors. Our results hold over a broad parameter regime where the average degree only grows poly-logarithmically with the number of nodes. Using experiments with simulated and real datasets, we show that our method achieves better error with lower variability over competing methods, and processes real world networks of up to 100,000 nodes within tens of seconds.

However, showing the user only those articles with highest expected CTR precludes the display of some ads; if the publisher had previously guaranteed the delivery of a certain volume of impressions to such ads, then underdelivery penalties might have to be paid. We propose a joint optimization of article selection and ad serving that minimizes underdelivery by shaping some of the incoming traffic to pages where underperforming ads can be displayed, while incurring only minor drops in CTR. In addition to formulating the problem, we design an online optimization algorithm that can find the optimal traffic shaping probabilities for each new user using only a cache of one number per ad contract.

Adam Cobb,,2021,,"Prior research suggests that individuals react negatively when they perceive they are underpaid. Moreover, individuals frequently select pay referents who share their race and gender, suggesting that demographic similarity affects one’s knowledge of pay differences. Leveraging these insights, the authors examine whether the gender and racial composition of a work unit shapes individuals’ reactions to pay deprivation. Using field data from a large health care organization, they find that pay deprivation resulting from workers receiving less pay than their same-sex and same-race coworkers prompts a significantly stronger response than does pay deprivation arising from workers receiving less pay than their demographically dissimilar colleagues. A supplemental experiment reveals that this relationship likely results from individuals’ propensity to select same-category others as pay referents, shaping workers’ information about their colleagues’ pay.

To investigate how executives cope with the divergent interests of workers and shareholders, the author examines how much firms claim they will earn on the assets in their defined benefit (DB) pension plans. In a DB arrangement, employees forgo wages in the present in order to receive postretirement income, and they rely on executives to properly fund and manage plan assets. Executives, however, can increase the amount they expect the firm to earn on plan assets, which increases firm earnings in the current period but may undermine workers’ retirement security if expectations do not match actual returns over time.

Drawing on research on social comparisons and firm boundaries, we argue that large firms are susceptible to their employees making social comparisons about wages and that firms undertake strategies, such as wage compression, to help ameliorate their damaging effects. We argue that wage compression affects the distribution of wages throughout the broader labor market and that, consequently, state levels of income inequality will increase as fewer individuals in a state are employed by large firms. We hypothesize that the negative relationship between large-firm employment and income inequality will weaken when large employers are more racially diverse and their workers are dispersed across a greater number of establishments. Our results show that as the number of workers in a state employed by large firms declines, income inequality in that state increases. When these firms are more racially diverse, however, the negative relationship between large-firm employment and income inequality weakens.

Adam Cobb,,2017,,"Wage inequality in the United States has risen dramatically over the past few decades, prompting scholars to develop a number of theoretical accounts for the upward trend. This study argues that large firms have been a prominent labor-market institution that mitigates inequality. By compensating their low- and middle-wage employees with a greater premium than their higher-wage counterparts, large U.S. firms reduced overall wage dispersion. Yet, broader changes to employment relations associated with the demise of internal labor markets and the emergence of alternative employment arrangements have undermined large firms’ role as an equalizing institution. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we find that in 1989, although all private-sector workers benefited from a firm-size wage premium, the premium was significantly higher for individuals at the lower end and middle of the wage distribution compared to those at the higher end. Between 1989 and 2014, the average firm-size wage premium declined markedly. The decline, however, was exclusive to those at the lower end and middle of the wage distribution, while there was no change for those at the higher end. As such, the uneven declines in the premium across the wage spectrum could account for about 20% of rising wage inequality during this period, suggesting that firms are of great importance to the study of rising inequality.

Adam Cobb,,2015,,"Since the early 1980s, employment in the United States has undergone significant transformation as the large corporations that once safeguarded employees with stable jobs and rewards for loyalty have replaced these employment relationships with ones based on cost containment and flexibility. One important consequence of these developments is that firms have abdicated their role as a critical risk bearer in society. Although evidence suggests that firms have increasingly shifted market risks onto their workforce, to date, there have been few detailed analyses exploring what factors have driven this phenomenon. This study adds to our understanding of why firms have transferred risk to their employees by examining the decline of a highly institutionalized practice wherein large U.S. firms used to bear retirement risk: the defined benefit (DB) pension plan. Through a detailed analysis, I show that variance in the presence, power, and interests of shareholders and employees at the firm level differentially affect a firm’s willingness to shift the risk of retirement onto its workers. Specifically, I demonstrate empirically that different types of shareholders have differential effects on a firm’s retirement practices, suggesting that the changing equity ownership structure of large U.S. firms has played a key role in how risk is allocated between workers and firms. Declines in employee power have also played a role because firm levels of unionization positively affect rates of DB participation for both unionized and nonunionized workers.",Crossref,84.2105263157895,10.1287/orsc.2015.1001,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2015.1001,,,Goal 8,0.04666863447288024,False,

State and local business subsidies for investment and employment have tripled in size over the past 30 years, but transparency problems inhibit clear assessments of whether subsidies achieve their intended outcomes. We examine both internal disclosure laws, which mandate subsidy reporting by the granting state agency to other state oversight agencies, and external disclosure laws, which mandate reporting to the public. We find positive effects of subsidies on local employment when subsidies are subject to internal disclosure laws; by implementing such regimes, governments could forego 1.2–1.7 subsequent subsidies per county, saving $419.0–$593.5 million in aggregate. In contrast, we observe little effect of external disclosure, which we show is due to governments either substituting to other types of incentives or posting stale information that impedes public monitoring. We contribute to the government disclosure literature by demonstrating the real employment effects of internal government disclosures, and we provide policy‐relevant evidence about the conditions under which external disclosure regimes facilitate public monitoring.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12591,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12591,,,Goal 8,0.05330531871788064,True,employment policies
Rex Du,,2022,,"Problem definition: Lawmakers have begun to introduce “fair schedule” legislations that require employers to provide shift workers with more predictable and consistent work schedules. Business owners are concerned that the resultant loss of scheduling flexibility could reduce overall operational efficiency. We argue this is not necessarily the case. Academic/practical relevance: Although recent studies suggest that increasing schedule predictability by reducing “just-in-time” scheduling can increase productivity, few have examined the effects of schedule consistency on worker productivity. Our study fills this void by investigating the impact of schedule consistency on cashier productivity in grocery retailing. Methodology: We estimate econometric models using transaction level scanner data including more than 1.2 million shopping baskets processed by 126 cashiers working for a local grocer. Work schedule consistency is operationalized via two metrics: (1) hour-of-the-day consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work in the same hours of the day, and (2) day-of-the-week consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work on the same days of the week. Results: We find that, on average, hour-of-the-day consistency and day-of-the-week consistency increase cashier productivity by 0.95% and 1.63%, respectively. These effects are much stronger for inexperienced cashiers (e.g., an average productivity boost of 3.39% and 7.93%, respectively, for the new hires). Managerial implications: Our findings suggest that (a) business owners can increase shift workers’ productivity by providing them with more consistent work schedules, and (b) the productivity of less-experienced shift workers, especially new hires, is more vulnerable to inconsistent work schedules, highlighting the potential for operational efficiency gains from greater schedule consistency, especially for businesses employing a high portion of inexperienced shift workers.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2022.1132,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.1132,,,Goal 8,0.02749470219591612,False,labour productivity

In the age of digital marketing and big data, marketers are inundated with increasingly rich data from an ever-expanding array of sources. Such data may help marketers generate insights about customers and competitors. One fundamental question remains: How can marketers wrestle massive flows of existing and nascent data resources into coherent, effective growth strategies? Against such a backdrop, the Marketing Science Institute has made “capturing information to fuel growth” a top research priority. The authors begin by discussing the streetlight effect—an overreliance on readily available data due to ease of measurement and application—as contributing to the disconnect between marketing data growth and firm growth. They then use the customer equity framework to structure the discussion of six areas where they see substantial undertapped opportunities: incorporating social network and biometric data in customer acquisition, trend and competitive interaction data in customer development, and unstructured and causal data in customer retention.

Uncovering the predominant patterns of such co-considerations can help businesses learn more about the competitive structure of the market in the mind of the consumer. Extant research has shown that various types of online and offline consumer activity data (e.g., shopping baskets, search and browsing histories, social media mentions) can be used to infer product co-considerations. In this paper, we study a case of uncovering co-consideration patterns using a massive dataset of online price quote requests from U.S. auto shoppers. The main challenge we face is that, for privacy protection, no unique individual identifier (anonymous or otherwise) is contained in the data. Such a data deficiency prevents us from using existing methods such as affinity analysis for inferring co-considerations.

Two opposing forces affect backer decisions: backers are more likely to back a project that has already reached a greater fraction of its funding goal (positive externalities), but the backing propensity declines over time (negative deadline effects). These two competing forces give rise to a time‐dependent critical threshold of funding that a project must attain to achieve successful funding.

We discover distinct temporal usage patterns that can distinguish forward-looking users from myopic ones. An empirical test is constructed to test for individual forward-looking behavior and applied to a unique data set of individual mobile data users’ daily usage volume over multiple months. We find a considerable proportion of users (about 40%) are indeed forward looking and also find empirical evidence of individual consumer myopia. Our dynamic structural model enables sophisticated counterfactual simulations incorporating various factors (e.g., consumer anticipation, plan switch) to deliver rich implications for targeted promotion design. As we find, promotions targeting only forward-looking consumers could be significantly more profitable than blanket promotions uniformly applied to all.

Rui Gao,,2025,,"Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization has emerged as a recent topic with broader applications in operations research and machine learning. Various proofs have been presented in the literature, each differing in assumptions and levels of generality. In “A Short and General Duality Proof for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization,” Zhang, Yang, and Gao present a novel elementary proof that not only shortens existing frameworks but also offers surprising generalizations. Leveraging classical Legendre—Fenchel duality, they demonstrate that strong duality is contingent on a certain interchangeability principle.

Rui Gao,,2024,,"We study policy optimization for the feature-based newsvendor, which seeks an end-to-end policy that renders an explicit mapping from features to ordering decisions. Most existing works restrict the policies to some parametric class that may suffer from suboptimality (such as affine class) or lack of interpretability (such as neural networks). Differently, we aim to optimize over all functions of features. In this case, the classic empirical risk minimization yields a policy that is not well-defined on unseen feature values. To avoid such degeneracy, we consider a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework. This leads to an adjustable robust optimization, whose optimal solutions are notoriously difficult to obtain except for a few notable cases. Perhaps surprisingly, we identify a new class of policies that are proven to be exactly optimal and can be computed efficiently. The optimal robust policy is obtained by extending an optimal robust in-sample policy to unobserved feature values in a particular way and can be interpreted as a Lipschitz regularized critical fractile of the empirical conditional demand distribution. We compare our method with several benchmarks using synthetic and real data and demonstrate its superior empirical performance. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

Rui Gao,,2023,,"Distributionally robust stochastic optimization (DRSO) is an approach to optimization under uncertainty in which, instead of assuming that there is a known true underlying probability distribution, one hedges against a chosen set of distributions. In this paper, we first point out that the set of distributions should be chosen to be appropriate for the application at hand and some of the choices that have been popular until recently are, for many applications, not good choices. We next consider sets of distributions that are within a chosen Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution. Such a choice of sets has two advantages: (1) The resulting distributions hedged against are more reasonable than those resulting from other popular choices of sets. (2) The problem of determining the worst-case expectation over the resulting set of distributions has desirable tractability properties. We derive a strong duality reformulation of the corresponding DRSO problem and construct approximate worst-case distributions (or an exact worst-case distribution if it exists) explicitly via the first-order optimality conditions of the dual problem. Our contributions are fourfold. (i) We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a worst-case distribution, which are naturally related to the growth rate of the objective function. (ii) We show that the worst-case distributions resulting from an appropriate Wasserstein distance have a concise structure and a clear interpretation. (iii) Using this structure, we show that data-driven DRSO problems can be approximated to any accuracy by robust optimization problems, and thereby many DRSO problems become tractable by using tools from robust optimization.

Stephen Gilbert,,2024,,"Several major on-line platforms operate two channels: An agency channel in which suppliers retain control over prices and quantities and pay a portion of sales revenue to the platform, and a reselling channel in which the platform purchases goods from the supplier and resells them to consumers. These two channels run in parallel and many suppliers interact with only one of them. Although it is quite easy for a supplier to sell through a platform’s agency channel, they must typically be invited to participate in the reselling channel. We develop a model of a powerful platform that can offer a supplier a two-part contract to induce it to participate in its reselling channel instead of its agency channel. When the supplier sells through the platform’s agency channel, we find that if the competition among the traditional resellers is at least moderate and the on-line platform is a close enough substitute for traditional resale channel, then the equilibrium quantities sold through the on-line and traditional channels both exceed the first best quantities. This would not occur if the supplier sold through either the on-line or the traditional channel in isolation. Nor would it occur if the supplier sold through the platform’s reselling channel.

Stephen Gilbert,,2022,,"Problem definition: Although it is well known that a reseller’s ability to hold strategic inventory under a short-term supply contract can potentially benefit both the reseller and a supplier, existing research on strategic inventory focuses almost exclusively on exclusive reselling environments. However, in practice, multiple suppliers often sell to the same nonexclusive reseller, and it is not uncommon for suppliers to ask for future commitments to order quantities from resellers in return for their own commitment to wholesale prices. We investigate how the possibility of strategic inventory influences competing suppliers’ choices between short-term transactional and long-term commitment contracts to a nonexclusive reseller. Methodology/results: Using a game-theoretic model, we consider the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a single, nonexclusive reseller over a two-period horizon in which demand is deterministic. We demonstrate that in nonexclusive reselling environments, where more than one supplier sells its product through the same reseller, the use of strategic inventory under short-term contracts intensifies the price competition between suppliers. We show how this effect can be mitigated when one or both suppliers offer a long-term contract. Moreover, we show that long-term contracts can arise as an equilibrium outcome, particularly when products are more substitutable or holding costs are large. Managerial implications: By considering the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a nonexclusive reseller in a multiperiod setting, we contribute to the literature on strategic contracting and long versus short-term contracts.

Stephen Gilbert,,2014,,"Prior literature has shown that, for a symmetric information setting, supplier encroachment into a reseller's market can mitigate double marginalization and benefit both the supplier and the reseller. This paper extends the investigation of supplier encroachment to the environment where the reseller might be better informed than the supplier. We find that the launch of the supplier's direct channel can result in costly signaling behavior on the part of the reseller, in which he reduces his order quantity when the market size is small. Such a downward order distortion can amplify double marginalization. As a result, in addition to the “win–win” and “win–lose” outcomes for the supplier and the reseller, supplier encroachment can also lead to “lose–lose” and “lose–win” outcomes, particularly when the reseller has a significant efficiency advantage in the selling process and the prior probability of a large market is low. We further explore the implications of those findings for information management in supply chains. Complementing the conventional understanding, we show that with the ability to encroach, the supplier may prefer to sell to either a better informed or an uninformed reseller in different scenarios.

Stephen Gilbert,,2019,,"It is now widely accepted that a retailer’s use of strategic inventory can mitigate double marginalization and improve the coordination of a supply chain, potentially benefiting both the downstream retailer and an upstream manufacturer. However, this conclusion has typically been based on the assumption that the manufacturer can observe the retailer’s level of inventory before making wholesale pricing decisions. In reality, there are many situations in which neither the retailer’s sales nor inventory are observable to the manufacturer, effectively concealing the action taken by the retailer. We investigate the implications of such a lack of observability on the use of strategic inventory in a supply chain consisting of a single retailer and a single manufacturer. We find that the manufacturer’s inability to observe inventory has significant implications for the amount of inventory and the range of holding cost for which it is held in equilibrium. In addition, we find that, in the absence of any form of uncertainty, which the manufacturer could benefit from responding to, he may prefer not to observe the retailer’s inventory.

A consumer is either loyal to one of the retailers or is a shopper who follows a rational dynamic search process based on the prices and available assortments.

We demonstrate that, by adding a low‐end product line extension, an OEM can induce a strategic supplier to offer more favorable pricing. Moreover, depending upon the cost structure and relative performance of the product line extension, the OEM may benefit even more from the low‐end line extension if it is produced by a rival instead of by itself, even if it cannot obtain any licensing income from it.

Using a manufacturer who leases her product directly to consumers as a point of reference, we find that an isolated change in either the channel structure (selling through an intermediary), or the operational mode (leasing to selling) can decrease the manufacturer's willingness to provide durability.

Specifically, the traditional result that a manufacturer who leases provides more durability than one who sells, can be reversed in a decentralized channel.",Crossref,96.7741935483871,10.1111/poms.12335,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12335,,,Goal 13,0.002263104691389064,False,
Stephen Gilbert,,2015,,"The objective of this study was to extend existing understanding of supplier encroachment to contexts in which there is information asymmetry and the supplier can use nonlinear pricing. Prior research has shown that supplier encroachment can mitigate double marginalization and thus benefit both the supplier and the reseller. However, under symmetric information, this benefit disappears if the supplier can use nonlinear pricing. In our model, the reseller observes the true market size while the supplier knows only the prior distribution, that is, a seemingly ideal setting for implementing mechanism design through nonlinear pricing. We first show that, because encroachment capability enables the supplier to make an ex post output decision, it fundamentally alters the structure of the optimal nonlinear pricing policy. In addition to the usual downward distortion effect, where the reseller may purchase less than the efficient quantity, we also have the possibility for upward distortion. Thus, under asymmetric information and nonlinear pricing, supplier encroachment has two opposing effects. On one hand, the ability to shift sales to the direct channel allows the supplier to reduce information rents with less sacrifice of efficiency; but on the other hand, by introducing the possibility of her own opportunistic behavior, it can result in upward distortion of the quantities sold through the reselling channel, which is a new source of inefficiency. Depending upon the relative efficiency of the reselling channel and the demand distribution, either of these two effects may dominate and the supplier's ability to encroach may either benefit or hurt both the supplier and the reseller.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12210,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12210,,,Goal 9,0.008505198696483338,False,

Linda Golden,,2016,,"An important development in personal lines of insurance in the United States is the use of credit history data for insurance risk classification to predict losses. This research presents the results of collaboration with industry conducted by a university at the request of its state legislature. The purpose was to see the viability and validity of the use of credit scoring to predict insurance losses given its controversial nature and criticism as redundant of other predictive variables currently used. Working with industry and government, this study analyzed more than 175,000 policyholders’ information for the relationship between credit score and claims. Credit scores were significantly related to incurred losses, evidencing both statistical and practical significance. We investigate whether the revealed relationship between credit score and incurred losses was explainable by overlap with existing underwriting variables or whether the credit score adds new information about losses not contained in existing underwriting variables. The results show that credit scores contain significant information not already incorporated into other traditional rating variables (e.g., age, sex, driving history). We discuss how sensation seeking and self-control theory provide a partial explanation of why credit scoring works (the psycho-social perspective). This article also presents an overview of biological and chemical correlates of risk taking that helps explain why knowing risk-taking behavior in one realm (e.g., risky financial behavior and poor credit history) transits to predicting risk-taking behavior in other realms (e.g., automobile insurance incurred losses). Additional research is needed to advance new nontraditional loss prediction variables from social media consumer information to using information provided by technological advances.

Caitlin Gorback,,2022,,"Pigouvian taxes and user fees can address environmental externalities and efficiently fund transportation infrastructure, but these policies may place burdens on poorer households. This paper presents new evidence on the distributional consequences of the gasoline tax, bus and light-rail charges, and a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax. Gas taxes have become more regressive over time, partially because of environmentally oriented technological change, although the share of expenditures on gas taxes declines with expenditures much less than the share of income spent on gas taxes declines with income. Replacing the gasoline tax with a household-level VMT tax would increase the average tax burden on households in the top income and expenditure deciles, because of their greater use of hybrid-electric and battery-electric vehicles. This progressive shift would be small given current levels of hybrid and electric vehicle ownership, but will be larger in the future if such vehicles continue to be more common among higher- than lower-income households. An expanded commercial VMT would place a larger burden, as a share of expenditures, on lower-income or lower-expenditure households, because better-off households consume more nontradable goods that do not require transportation. User charges for airports, subways, and commuter rail are progressive, and bus fees loom much larger for lower-income households.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.1086/724352,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f4f0ab1920ae7c01110e96f421257489ca86ff5,,,Goal 12,0.02549105789616106,False,
Steven Gray,,2024,,"Entrepreneurs often struggle to add cofounders who are both interpersonally compatible and who possess complementary resources (i.e., hybrid ties). In this paper, we suggest that there are cognitive and motivational differences between lead entrepreneurs and potential cofounders that complicate the formation of hybrid ties. We propose that lead entrepreneurs prioritize resources, whereas potential cofounders prioritize interpersonal compatibility, because of differences in construal level and utilitarian motives during the team formation process. Although these differences can complicate the formation of hybrid ties, we posit that lead entrepreneurs can overcome these differences by communicating in ways that highlight their interpersonal compatibility with potential cofounders.

Because prior research has focused on how networks gradually evolve over time, there is little insight into how an exogenous shock, such as the pandemic, would reshape informal ties among colleagues that comprise their social networks. Drawing upon the optimal matching theory of social support, we develop a psychological perspective on how individuals recalibrate their social ties to enable coping with the uncertainty and anxiety introduced by the pandemic shock. We test our theory using a three-wave network data set from a sample of colocated, full-time MBA students before and after the onset of the pandemic. Following the onset of the pandemic, we found there was an overall reduction in the maintenance of advice ties. We also found that emotional exhaustion exacerbated this effect, and when emotional exhaustion was high, racially homophilous advice ties were just as likely to be dropped as heterophilous advice ties. We also found, unexpectedly, that COVID-19 reduced the maintenance of friendship ties, perhaps because social distancing reduced emotional support opportunities. Thoughts of anticipated inclusion mitigated this negative effect, particularly for racially heterophilous friendships.

Steven Gray,,2020,,"We develop and test a theoretical model that explains how collective psychological ownership—shared feelings of joint possession over something—emerges within new creative teams that were launched to advance one person’s (i.e., a creative lead’s) preconceived idea. Our model proposes that such teams face a unique challenge—an initial asymmetry in feelings of psychological ownership for the idea between the creative lead who conceived the idea and new team members who are beginning to work on the idea. We suggest that the creative lead can resolve this asymmetry and foster the emergence of collective psychological ownership by enacting two interpersonal behaviors—help seeking and territorial marking. These behaviors build collective ownership by facilitating the unifying centripetal force of team identification and preventing the divisive centrifugal force of team ownership conflict. Our model also proposes that collective ownership positively relates to the early success of new creative teams.

Steven Gray,,2019,,"Abstract Cross‐unit ties–relationships that facilitate discretionary information sharing between individuals from different business units–offer a range of organizational benefits. Scholars argue that organizations can promote cross‐unit ties by: (a) formally bringing together individuals from different business units into structural links (e.g., cross‐unit strategic committees) to encourage the formation of new cross unit ties and, (b) transferring individuals across units, which can increase cross‐unit interaction when ties to the prior unit are maintained. This study considers the notion that the success of these formal interventions in fostering cross‐unit interaction is contingent on identification with the local unit relative to identification with the broader organization. Specifically, we propose that structural links are more likely to foster cross‐unit ties when organizational identification is high and unit identification is low. In contrast, lateral transfers are more likely to result in cross‐unit ties when both organizational identification and unit identification are high. We find general support for these propositions in data obtained from a sample of senior leaders of a Fortune 200 agribusiness company before and after a restructuring designed to stimulate cross‐unit information sharing. Our model and results make important contributions to our understanding of the relationship between formal and informal structure and reconcile conflicting views regarding the moderating effect of unit identification on intergroup relations.",Crossref,80.3493449781659,10.1111/peps.12337,https://doi.org/10.1111/peps.12337,,,Goal 17,0.008071682938184208,False,
Paul Green,,2022,,"Problem definition: We examine the impact of four classes of workplace interruptions on short-term (working hours) and long-term (across-shifts) worker performance in an agribusiness setting. The interruptions are organized in a two-by-two framework in which they result (or do not result) in a physical task requirement and lead to a varying degree of attention shift from the primary task. Academic/practical relevance: Prior operations management literature primarily examines the long-term effects of a single class of interruption that reduces performance. Our study contributes to this literature by examining multiple classes of interruptions that lead to positive and negative outcomes over the short-term in addition to the long-term. Further, our study also contributes to understanding the impact of general task transitions (interruptions) on worker performance, and the interrupting tasks include tasks that are not part of workers’ primary job duties. Our study is relevant to work settings that envelop high manual labor and experience interruptions regularly. Finally, we offer strategies to improve operational performance. Methodology: Using a granular data set on worker productivity from 211 harvesters yielding 117,581 truckloads of fruit harvested for 9,819 worker shifts, we utilize an instrumental variable approach with two-stage residual inclusion estimation on a mix of linear and nonlinear models to examine and quantify the impact of interruptions on both short- and long-term worker productivity. Results: We identify a new interruption class, a pause—interruptions that provide the physical respite and limit the degree of attention shift from the primary task. We find that pauses improve worker productivity in the short- and long-term. Next, we find that scheduled breaks hurt (improve) the worker’s productivity in the short-term (long-term). Finally, we find that harvester breakdown and travel across field interruptions that drain physical resources and cause attention shift hurt worker productivity in the short- and long-term. We quantify the impact (in our field context) of a five-minute increase in each of these work interruptions on average worker productivity. Managerial implications: Our study demonstrates that various work interruptions can have positive or negative effects on workers’ productivity. We suggest that introducing brief pauses in a workday and simultaneously reminding (before initiating the pause) employees about the tasks yet to be completed or goals to be achieved for the rest of the shift can help maintain their focus on the work and yield high-performance benefits. We also suggest strategies that limit the restart costs and increase the predictability of interruptions that hurt performance. For example, in regards to scheduled breaks, planning the break after completing a subtask or reaching a subgoal can limit their adverse effects. Further, informing workers on the possibility of interruption circumstances at the beginning of the work shift can help them plan for these events and improve engagement and performance on the primary job.",Crossref,88.1578947368421,10.1287/msom.2021.1053,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.1053,,,Goal 17,0.01957776943079168,False,

John Griffin,,2021,,"This article synthesizes the large literature regarding the role of various players in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) securitization at the center of the 2008–09 US housing and financial crisis. Underwriting banks facilitated wide-scale mortgage fraud by knowingly misreporting key loan characteristics underlying mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under the cover of complexity, credit rating agencies catered to investment banks by issuing increasingly inflated ratings on both RMBS and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Originators who engaged in mortgage fraud gained market share, as did CDO managers who catered to underwriters by accepting the lowest-quality MBS collateral. Appraisal targeting and inflated appraisals were the norm. RMBS and CDO prices indicate that the marginal AAA investor was unaware of pervasive mortgage fraud and ratings inflation, but these factors were strongly related to future deal performance. The supply of fraudulent credit was not uniform, but clustered in certain geographic regions and zip codes. As these dubious originators extended credit to those who could not afford the loans, the credit expansion led to house price booms and subsequent crashes in these zip codes.

Diwakar Gupta,,2016,,"We present a multiperiod model of a retail supply chain, consisting of a single supplier and a single retailer, in which regular replenishment occurs periodically but players have the option to support fast delivery when customers experience a stockout during a replenishment period. Because expedited shipments increase the supplier's transportation cost, and possibly production/inventory costs, the supplier typically charges a markup over and above the prevailing wholesale price for fast‐shipped items. When fast shipping is not supported, items are backordered if customers are willing to wait until the start of the next replenishment period. We characterize the retailers and the supplier's optimal stocking and production policies and then utilize our analytical framework to study how the two players respond to changes in supply chain parameters. We identify a sufficient condition such that the centralized supply chain is better off with the fast‐ship option. We find a range of markups for fast‐ship orders such that the fast‐ship option is preferred by both the supplier and the retailer in a decentralized chain. However, a markup that is a win–win for both players may not exist even when offering fast‐ship option is better for the centralized chain. Our analysis also shows that depending on how the markup is determined, greater customer participation in fast‐ship orders does not necessarily imply more profits for the two players. For some predetermined markups, the retailer's profit with the fast‐ship option is higher when more customers are willing to wait. However, the retailer may not be able to benefit from the fast‐ship option because the supplier may choose not to support the fast‐ship option when fast‐ship participation increases due to the fact that the fast‐ship participation rate adversely affects the initial order size.",Crossref,98.1818181818182,10.1111/poms.12499,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12499,,,Goal 9,0.01128407254290167,False,supply chain disruptions

Work assignment decisions must be made sequentially without information about future job requests, a driver’s earlier assignment may not be interrupted to accommodate a new job (no pre-emption), and the scheduler may need to select a particular driver when multiple drivers can perform a job.

A key objective of this article is to develop an algorithm that performs well in both average and worst-case scenarios. For this reason, our approach includes discretionary parameters that allow the user to achieve a balance between a myopic approach (accept all jobs that can be scheduled) and a strategic approach (consider accepting only if jobs are longer than a certain threshold).

Genaro Gutierrez,,2022,,"Many decisions must be made before relevant uncertainties are revealed; hence robustness approaches to decision making are often considered. There are two major approaches to robustness in the literature: (i) maximizing the value of the worst outcome and (ii) minimizing the maximum ex post regret of the decision. While the first approach seeks the best worst‐case outcome, it may result in substantial opportunity losses relative to the ex post optimal decision; this is particularly critical in new product design decisions as it leaves the leading firm exposed to a late entrant who designs its products after uncertainties are resolved. The second approach seeks to minimize these ex post opportunity losses, but it may expose the decision maker to greater downside risk, that is, lower outcome in the worst case. Most studies have examined one of these approaches in isolation; in contrast, in this study, we explore the trade‐offs between protecting upside regret and downside risk with a focus on a product line design (PLD) problem, which relies greatly on conjoint analysis data. The PLD problem may suffer from significant uncertainty in the partworth utilities which define the attribute‐level consumer preferences on a product for different population segments. Our numerical experiments, based on a real conjoint data set, show that neither robustness approaches dominates the other and hence our proposed approach uses both.

Genaro Gutierrez,,2017,,"Motivated by a unique agribusiness setting, this paper develops an optimization-based approach to estimate the mean and standard deviation of probability distributions from noisy quantile judgments provided by experts. The approach estimates the mean and standard deviations as weighted linear combinations of quantile judgments, where the weights are explicit functions of the expert’s judgmental errors. The approach is analytically tractable, and provides flexibility to elicit any set of quantiles from an expert. The approach also establishes that using an expert’s quantile judgments to deduce the distribution parameters is equivalent to collecting data with a specific sample size and enables combining the expert’s judgments with those of other experts. It also shows analytically that the weights for the mean add up to one and the weights for the standard deviation add up to zero—these properties have been observed numerically in the literature in the last 30 years, but without a systematic explanation. The theory has been in use at Dow AgroSciences for two years for making an annual decision worth $800 million. The use of the approach has resulted in the following monetary benefits: (i) firm’s annual production investment has reduced by 6%–7% and (ii) profit has increased by 2%–3%.

Our study addresses a significant gap in the literature that has largely examined the effects of different governance mechanisms in isolation. We predict and find that mandated clawbacks increase managers’ tendency to use operational discretion (relative to accounting discretion) when board monitoring is weak, but not when board monitoring is strong.

Because prior research has focused on how networks gradually evolve over time, there is little insight into how an exogenous shock, such as the pandemic, would reshape informal ties among colleagues that comprise their social networks. Drawing upon the optimal matching theory of social support, we develop a psychological perspective on how individuals recalibrate their social ties to enable coping with the uncertainty and anxiety introduced by the pandemic shock. We test our theory using a three-wave network data set from a sample of colocated, full-time MBA students before and after the onset of the pandemic. Following the onset of the pandemic, we found there was an overall reduction in the maintenance of advice ties. We also found that emotional exhaustion exacerbated this effect, and when emotional exhaustion was high, racially homophilous advice ties were just as likely to be dropped as heterophilous advice ties. We also found, unexpectedly, that COVID-19 reduced the maintenance of friendship ties, perhaps because social distancing reduced emotional support opportunities. Thoughts of anticipated inclusion mitigated this negative effect, particularly for racially heterophilous friendships.

John Hatfield,,2020,,"Recent years have seen an explosion of scholarship on “personalized law.” Commentators foresee a world in which regulators armed with big data and machine learning techniques determine the optimal legal rule for every regulated party, then instantaneously disseminate their decisions via smartphones and other “smart” devices. They envision a legal utopia in which every fact pattern is assigned society’s preferred legal treatment in real time. 
 
But regulation is a dynamic process; regulated parties react to law. They change their behavior to pursue their preferred outcomes—which often diverge from society’s—and they will continue to do so under personalized law: They will provide regulators with incomplete or inaccurate information. They will attempt to manipulate the algorithms underlying personalized laws by taking actions intended to disguise their true characteristics. Personalized law can also (unintentionally) encourage regulated parties to act in socially undesirable ways, a phenomenon known as moral hazard. 
 
Moreover, regulators seeking to combat these dynamics will face significant constraints. Regulators will have imperfect information, both because of privacy concerns and because regulated parties and intermediaries will muddle regulators’ data. They may lack the authority or the political will to respond to regulated parties’ behavior. The transparency requirements of a democratic society may hinder their ability to thwart gamesmanship. Concerns about unintended consequences may further lower regulators’ willingness to personalize law.

Thus, when firms disaggregate forecasts and subsequently release disaggregated actual earnings numbers, investors reward firms that beat those multiple benchmarks, but punish firms that miss those multiple benchmarks.

Wayne Hoyer,,2025,,"In recent years, more and more consumers have defended brands online against criticism. Despite the high relevance of consumer brand defense (CBD) when recovering from adverse critique such as negative word of mouth online, the understanding of the motives that drive CBD beyond emotionally intense consumer–brand connections remains limited. Building on a social media analysis of the phenomenon, qualitative in-depth interviews with consumers who defend brands, and a survey of brand defenders, the authors provide a better understanding of the motivational and relational drivers as well as the contextual factors of CBD. Specifically, the results show that brand defenders are driven by the motives of reciprocal altruism, equity restoration, and egoism as well as relational factors including brand satisfaction and attachment. Using a large-scale study with 570 actual brand defenders along with subsequent cluster analysis, the authors distinguish three distinct brand defender types: brand promoters, justice promoters, and self-promoters. These defender types differ not only in their behavior but also in terms of contextual factors related to consumer characteristics, brand-related criticism, and company-related dynamics that influence their active engagement in CBD. Applying the distinct characteristics of the three defender types, the authors discuss how managers can more effectively motivate consumers to defend their brand online.",Crossref,96.8152866242038,10.1177/10949968251320615,https://doi.org/10.1177/10949968251320615,,,Goal 16,0.01534660855288872,False,
Wayne Hoyer,,2023,,"Abstract The use of conversational agents (e.g., chatbots) to simplify or aid consumers’ purchase decisions is on the rise. In designing those conversational agents, a key question for companies is whether and when it is advisable to enable voice-based rather than text-based interactions. Addressing this question, this study finds that matching consumers’ communication modality with product type (speaking about hedonic products; writing about utilitarian products) shapes consumers’ choice and increases choice satisfaction. Specifically, speaking fosters a feeling-based verbalizing focus, while writing triggers a reason-based focus. When this focus matches consumers’ mindset in evaluating the product type, preference fluency increases, thereby enhancing choice satisfaction. Accordingly, the authors provide insights into managing interactions with conversational agents more effectively to aid decision-making processes and increase choice satisfaction. Finally, they show that communication modality can serve as a strategic tool for low-equity brands to better compete with high-equity brands.",Crossref,89.3617021276596,10.1007/s11747-023-00987-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-023-00987-7,,,Goal 5,0.009112565445651649,False,
Wayne Hoyer,,2023,,"Abstract Recent technological advancements allow companies to incorporate increasingly heterogeneous and interrelated features into their products, which heightens the products’ complexity. In four experimental studies conducted with two product categories, this article reveals similarities and differences in terms of how the heterogeneity and interrelatedness of product features influence consumer attitudes (i.e., expected product usability and capability) and, in turn, purchase intentions. Moreover, it shows that both neglected dimensions of product complexity affect the corresponding influence of the number of product features but do so in considerably different ways. The findings suggest that companies can foster consumer adoption by deemphasizing a product’s feature heterogeneity, thereby avoiding low expected product usability, and by emphasizing its feature interrelatedness, thereby promoting high expected product capability. This article provides insights into how companies can manage the complexity of products during both product design (i.e., before market launch) and product advertising and selling (i.e., after market launch).",Crossref,85.589519650655,10.1007/s11747-023-00933-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-023-00933-7,,,Goal 12,0.02824307187933358,False,consumer behavior; sustainable product design

Two field studies and five online experiments provide evidence that the personality trait of buying impulsivity predicts differences in whether a shopper initially focuses on internal motivations (e.g., “because I love it”) or external motivations (e.g., “because it is on sale”) for unplanned purchases at the beginning of a shopping trip and, consistent with a mechanism of motivation balancing, that motivations for unplanned purchases change as a shopper satisfies their initial motivations. The studies also demonstrate how the level of buying impulsivity influences the effectiveness of point-of-purchase messages at stimulating unplanned purchases and consumers’ relative spending on unplanned purchases. Overall, these findings address conflicting results in previous shopping studies, advance the literature streams on consumer motivation and sequential choice, and contribute insights to enhance shopper-marketing programs.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/0022243720912284,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720912284,,,Goal 1,0.008126516301894869,False,

Empowered by new technological possibilities, an individual consumer can now wreak havoc on a brand with relatively little effort.

On the basis of different underlying motives, a conceptual framework distinguishes CBS (a form of hostile aggression: harming the brand as dominant motive) from other forms of negative consumer behavior, such as customer retaliation and negative word of mouth (instrumental aggression: harming a brand is only a means to achieve other objectives, e.g., restoring equity). This framework adapts insights from aggression and appraisal theories as well as qualitative interviews with actual saboteurs to a consumer–brand relationship context in order to develop an improved theoretical understanding of the under-researched phenomenon of CBS.

This research empirically examines the quality of customer-service brand relationships in the context of an airline's frequent flyer program. The authors show that service brand relationship quality (BRQ) involves both a hot (based on emotions) and a cold (based on object-relevant beliefs) component. They find that these two components have different implications for a service brand's performance and are at least partially driven by different antecedents whose relative importance changes over time. Specifically, cold BRQ is important for word-of-mouth behavior and is strongly driven by partner quality (i.e., the generalized assessment of the brand in its role as a relationship counterpart). Hot BRQ, on the other hand, has a stronger impact on willingness to pay a price premium and consideration set size. In early stages of a customer-brand relationship hot BRQ is more strongly driven by self-congruence (i.e., consumer's perception of the fit between his/her self and the brand's personality), in later stages partner quality becomes more relevant. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for the development of BRQ and the implementation of alternative growth strategies in a services context.",Crossref,86.6666666666667,10.1177/1094670514547580,https://doi.org/10.1177/1094670514547580,,,Goal 12,0.02568190954518725,False,
Insiya Hussain,,2024,,"Past research suggests that when organizations communicate the benefits of their work for human welfare—that is, use a social impact framing for work—job candidates are willing to accept lower wages because they expect the work to be personally meaningful. We argue that this explanation overlooks a less socially desirable mechanism by which social impact framing leads to lower compensation demands: the perception among job candidates that requesting higher pay will breach organizational expectations to value work for its intrinsic (rather than extrinsic) rewards, or constitute a motivational norm violation. We find evidence for our theory across five studies: a qualitative study (Study 1), a hiring experiment with undergraduate students (Study 2), an online labor market field experiment (Study 3), a vignette-based simulation (Study 4), and a stimulus sampling study using multiple occupations (Study 5). Exploratory analyses find that the negative effects are unique to monetary (versus nonmonetary) job rewards. Together, results uncover a novel mechanism by which emphasizing work for the greater good leads job candidates to accept lower wages—one that reflects candidates self-censoring on pay from concerns about violating organizational norms rather than solely from a willingness to trade higher pay for potentially meaningful work. Our research contributes to understandings of how social responsibility messaging impacts workers’ perceptions of organizations and negotiation behavior.

Sirkka Jarvenpaa,,2023,,"ABSTRACT Digital transformation can produce scaling in numbers – growing organisational boundaries by adding new users, customers, or members. For membership-based organisations, such as social movement organisations (SMOs), digital scaling brings an inflow of new resources and members at a pace that previously was unimaginable, as well as mounting power and influence. But sustained rapid growth in new membership also can introduce a tension related to digital scaling and political or social impact. In this research, we trace this tension to member prototype ambiguity – that is, to a perceived variation in the attributes, assumptions, and actions of the new members entering the organisation. Such ambiguity can have a destabilising effect on collective identity that might significantly weaken the political or social impact of the SMO. In this longitudinal study of Amnesty International, we examine how digital transformation and scaling unveiled this tension and how the professional core at two of Amnesty’s national sections, Australia and Sweden, addressed the prototype ambiguity that ensued.

Muhammad Jawad,,2021,,"Innovations are not always adopted due to their expected economic impact but often due to bandwagon pressure. Fueled by economic uncertainty, these “bandwagon innovations” are adopted once the bandwagon pressure reaches a certain threshold. Existing literature, however, has not examined this threshold’s sources nor considered the effect of a bandwagon adoption decision on threshold. Therefore, building on current knowledge about the bandwagon effect, organizational attention, and legitimacy, this paper develops a theoretical model to help understand the factors affecting threshold and making organizations more or less likely to adopt bandwagon innovations. The novel dynamic threshold model proposed here explains how attention to social or economic factors can affect an organization’s threshold. The model shows that the threshold may change such that an organization may be more likely to adopt a bandwagon innovation after prior resistance or resist one after prior adoption. Implications for organizational decision-makers and future research avenues are also discussed. Plain Language Summary The paper proposes a dynamic threshold model of bandwagon innovations, which illuminates the outcomes of the decision involving bandwagon innovations. If the bandwagon pressure does not exceed the threshold level (or the propensity to adopt a bandwagon innovation), then the organization resists the bandwagon, which increases legitimacy concerns. On the other hand, if the bandwagon pressure exceeds the threshold level, the organization adopts the bandwagon innovation. The primary determinant of this threshold is attention. Attention can be of two types; attention to social factors, which decreases the threshold level, and attention to economic factors, which increases the threshold level. The allocation of attention to the two factors varies based on the outcomes of the bandwagon innovation decision. The increased legitimacy concerns (in case of resisting a bandwagon innovation) lead the organization to allocate more attention to the social factors, thereby reducing the threshold level for the subsequent bandwagon innovation. In case of adopting a bandwagon innovation, the legitimacy concerns are reduced, and the organization's attention is redirected to assimilating the innovation and justifying the adoption costs, which makes the economic factors of any subsequent bandwagon innovation more salient and increases the threshold level until the current innovation is assimilated.",Crossref,100.0,10.1177/20413866211054201,https://doi.org/10.1177/20413866211054201,,,Goal 9,0.03392502231231702,False,innovation
Ross Jennings,,2017,,"Abstract We survey commercial bank lenders to better understand how they evaluate and react to variation in financial statement quality and how they view recent changes in accounting standards. A unique aspect of this study is that our respondents focus on medium‐size loans to private companies. In fact, more than 90 percent of the survey respondents primarily make credit decisions on loans between $250 thousand and $50 million. This is in contrast to prior archival research, which focuses primarily on very large loans to public firms or very small loans to private firms. We find that lenders in our sample distinguish among financial statements in terms of quality, including conservatism, primarily on the basis of accrual patterns and restatements. While this general result holds throughout our sample, financial statement quality is substantially more important for lenders making larger loans (over $10 million) as compared to very small loans (under $1 million). In addition, bank lenders are much more likely to respond to low‐quality reporting with collateral and guarantee requirements than with an increase in the interest rate charged. This finding is consistent for lenders making both larger and smaller loans. Finally, despite concerns in the academic literature, bank lenders in our sample actually hold a neutral‐to‐positive view of recent changes in accounting standards.

It provides foundational reasons to move away from the untenable idealism of value maximization, characterized here as a culmination outcome-oriented approach, towards a stakeholder-oriented approach that is concerned with broader comprehensive outcomes. It argues that the stakeholder approach more accurately reflects how business decision makers actually make choices; as compared to the shareholder primacy approach, which proposes that decision makers are able to seek (and should seek) to maximize a single-valued culmination score. It is argued that the value maximization approach is flawed because no decision-making space exists where a “maximal” allocation is available in its merely technical sense, free of the taint of politics or constraints of ethics. The stakeholder approach is a more realistic account of what decision-makers are actually able to do in discharging their managerial responsibilities; and thus, it provides a richer account of what they ought to do and how.

Volatility and horizon are critically important for assessing return predictors, as these factors affect how an investor learns about predictability and how she chooses to invest based on return forecasts.

From these reports, we identify 121 measures of poor earnings quality under four major categories: (i) sales quality; (ii) margin quality; (iii) cash flow quality; and (iv) others. As a first-cut to short-list stocks for detailed fundamental analysis, the RF appears to screen for larger, growing firms with lower barriers to arbitrage. The firms flagged by the RF also have higher M-score, F-score, and total and abnormal accruals. The average two (251) days abnormal return after the stock is first flagged by the RF is -1.30 (-18.5) percent, and such return is incremental to the return attributable to mispricing of accruals. Modified Jones and Dechow-Dichev models of abnormal accruals do not appear to capture RF identified signals well suggesting that such models are too coarse to pick up nuanced fundamental analysis conducted by the RF. In out of sample analyses, we find that the RF signals are associated with future restatements, AAERs, and GAAP-related lawsuits after controlling for other earnings quality indicators.

Urooj Khan,,2020,,"ABSTRACT Prior research finds that unrealized gains/losses on cash flow hedges are negatively associated with future earnings, and that investors and analysts fail to anticipate this association. These studies speculate that this mispricing is due to either poor derivatives disclosures or the accounting model for cash flow hedges. We examine whether enhanced mandatory derivatives disclosures set forth in FAS 161 improve users' understanding of firms' hedging activities and offer three main findings. First, we find that this mispricing does not persist after FAS 161. Second, we find that the correction of mispricing is greatest when disclosure might help investors most. Finally, we find that analyst forecast accuracy improves after FAS 161. Overall, our results suggest that the enhanced mandatory derivative disclosures required by FAS 161 improved users' understanding of the effects of derivative and hedging activities on future firm performance and firm value—and consequently mitigated investor mispricing.",Crossref,98.3425414364641,10.2308/tar-2018-0418,https://doi.org/10.2308/tar-2018-0418,,,Goal 1,0.004615015471109723,False,
Urooj Khan,,2020,,"We investigate the relation between corporate performance and overall economic growth in the United States. In particular, we focus on the impact of the U.S. corporate tax regime on this relation. Exploiting time-series variation and a tax shock, we document that the relatively higher corporate income tax rate and the tax treatment of foreign earnings of U.S. corporations have contributed to a disconnect between the performance of the corporate sector and the overall economy. Specifically, the growth of domestic (national) corporate profits, on average, has outpaced the growth of the domestic (national) economy, and this disconnect increases as the difference between the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the average tax rate of the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries increases. The underlying mechanism is fewer corporate profits being channeled into subsequent domestic investments when the U.S. tax rate is relatively higher, leading to lower economic growth.

Urooj Khan,,2019,,"Bank lending standards vary over time. Periods in which firms find it relatively easy to borrow are followed by periods in which banks scrutinize borrowers more and tighten lending. We predict that changes in lending standards affect the accounting conservatism of bank-dependent firms. Using (i) a natural experiment that leads to certain banks tightening lending standards for plausibly exogenous reasons and (ii) time series variation in economy-wide bank lending standards, we find that borrowers increase their asymmetric timely loss recognition in response to the tightening of lending standards. Further, riskier borrowers, borrowers less likely to violate loan covenants, and borrowers whose banks tighten lending standards to a greater extent display larger increases in conservatism following the tightening of lending standards. These results suggest that borrowers internalize the costs and benefits of increasing conservatism. Finally, borrowers do not seem to decrease conservatism immediately after the lending standards are loosened. Overall, our results illuminate a commonly observed banking phenomenon that can influence firms’ incentives to recognize losses, suggesting that developments in the banking sector can shape the information produced by firms in the real sector.

Urooj Khan,,2019,,"ABSTRACT I investigate whether fair value accounting can contribute to the banking industry's systemic risk. I focus on the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115 (SFAS No. 115), which required available‐for‐sale (AFS) securities to be recognized at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in equity through accumulated other comprehensive income. SFAS No. 115 increased banks' regulatory risk because, at the time, calculation of regulatory capital closely conformed with GAAP equity. I find that systemic risk increased following the adoption of SFAS No. 115. Furthermore, following a subsequent regulatory amendment—which excluded unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities from regulatory capital but did not change their GAAP treatment—systemic risk decreased. Taken together, the evidence suggests that fair value accounting has the potential to increase systemic risk through the explicit inclusion of volatile fair value estimates in regulatory bank capital adequacy assessments. I do not, however, find evidence of fair value accounting impacting systemic risk in its information role; that is, by providing information to a bank's external stakeholders about its financial position and performance. I also show that higher fair value volatility of investment securities, lower bank capital, and larger AFS security holdings increase banks' marginal contribution to systemic risk. My findings should interest regulators and policymakers, as recent regulatory changes in light of Basel III recommendations require unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities to be included in regulatory capital for advanced approaches banks.",Crossref,89.873417721519,10.1111/1911-3846.12501,https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12501,,,Goal 10,0.01750207799354165,False,financial market regulation

Unlike largely predetermined amortized cost measurement, recurring fair value measurement requires firms to invest in information and control systems to assess relevant economic conditions and estimate fair values quarterly. We expect these systems discipline insurers' OTT impairments. Exploiting statutory requirements that PC (life) insurers measure securities with NAIC designations from 3 to 5 at fair value (amortized cost) and disclose security-level accounting information, we predict and find that PC insurers record timelier OTT impairments of the same NAMBS with NAIC designations of 3 to 5 than life insurers. We predict and find weaker evidence of spillover effects to the timeliness of OTT impairments of the same NAMBS with NAIC designations of 1 or 2.

Urooj Khan,,2018,,"ABSTRACT We examine how personal lending relationships between lenders and managers are affected by information and accounting environments of borrowing firms. We address this question by exploring whether, following managerial turnover, lenders migrate with the manager from the firm where a relationship developed (origin firm) to the manager's new firm (destination firm). We find that the opacity of the external information environment of the destination firm significantly increases the probability of lenders' co-migration, while accounting irregularities at both the destination and origin firms decrease it. We also show that co-migration is affected by a lender's monitoring efficiency. A lender's monitoring efficiency increases its co-migration probability when a manager moves to an opaque firm, but not when she moves to a transparent one. When the destination or origin firm experiences accounting irregularities, even lenders with strong monitoring capabilities are mostly reluctant to continue their relationship with a migrating manager.",Crossref,91.4285714285714,10.2308/accr-52287,https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-52287,,,Goal 10,0.03479428961270505,False,

We develop a measure of the one-year-ahead expected rate of credit losses (ExpectedRCL) that combines various measures of credit risk disclosed by banks.

ExpectedRCL substantially outperforms net charge-offs in predicting one-year-ahead realized credit losses, and reflects nearly all the credit loss-related information in the charge-offs. ExpectedRCL also contains incremental information about one-year-ahead realized credit losses relative to the allowance and provision for loan losses and the fair value of loans.

Urooj Khan,,2018,,"We investigate the effectiveness of regulatory oversight exercised by the SEC against auditors over the years 1996-2009. The evidence suggests that the SEC is significantly less likely to name a Big N auditor as a defendant, after controlling for both the severity of the violation and for the characteristics of companies more likely to be audited by Big N auditors. Further, when the SEC does charge Big N auditors, the SEC (i) is less likely to impose harsher penalties on the Big N; and (ii) is less likely to name a Big N audit firm relative to individual Big N partners. Moreover, the SEC relies overwhelmingly on administrative proceedings, instead of the tougher civil proceedings, against auditors. One interpretation of these patterns is that the SEC’s enforcement against auditors is relatively mild. Other interpretations of these results are also discussed.

The objective of this work was to develop high‐resolution grids (0.25 ∘ × 0.25 ∘ ) of daily precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the five climate variables generally required to estimate evapostranspiration for Brazil. These five variables are maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed. We tested six different interpolation schemes to create the grids for these variables. The data were obtained from 3625 rain gauge and 735 weather stations for period of 1980–2013. We used a cross‐validation approach that compares point observed data to point interpolated estimates to select the best interpolation scheme for each climate variable. We also present the performance of the best interpolation for each climate variable at daily timescales and for river basins. The inverse distance weighting and angular distance weighting methods produced the best results. Performance of all methods was poorer prior to 1995 because of fewer stations and available data. The performance of the interpolation varies for different seasons for almost all variables. Forecasting capability was tested for precipitation only and performed adequately for the system state (wet or dry). Variations in the interpolation schemes across river basins are primarily attributed to differences in gauge or station network density.

Carey King,,2015,,"We translate between biophysical and economic metrics that characterize the role of energy in the economy. Specifically, using data from the International Energy Agency, we estimate the energy intensity ratio (EIR), a price-based proxy for a power return ratio (PRR ∼ P out / P invested ). The EIR is a useful metric, because for most countries and energy commodities, it can indicate the biophysical trends of net energy when data are too scarce to perform an original net energy analysis. We calculate EIR for natural gas, coal, petroleum and electricity for forty-four countries from 1978 to 2010. Global EIR values generally rise from 1978 to 1998, decline from 1998 to 2008 and then slightly rebound. These trends indicate one interpretation of the net energy of the world economy. To add perspective to our recent, but short, time series, we perform the same calculations for historical England and United Kingdom energy prices to demonstrate that a given energy price translates to different PRRs (EIR in this case) depending on the structure of the economy and technology. We review the formulation of PRRs and energy return ratios (ERR ∼ E out / E invested ) to indicate why PRRs translate to (the inverse of) energy prices and ERRs translate to (the inverse of) energy costs. We show why for any given value of an ERR or PRR, there is not a single corresponding energy cost or price, and vice versa.

Lisa Koonce,,2019,,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we investigate whether the current references to probability in standard setters' conceptual definitions of assets and liabilities cause individuals to believe that the probability of a future transfer of economic benefits must be above some meaningful threshold for an asset or a liability to exist—a belief that is contrary to standard setters' intent. Results of multiple experiments indicate that the majority of individuals do use a high probability threshold to determine asset existence, whereas for liabilities the majority use a very low threshold. Thus, even under ceteris paribus conditions, liabilities are more frequently judged to exist than assets—a phenomenon analogous to accounting conservatism, as has been discussed in terms of the performance statement. These findings are robust to variation in formal training and in type of liability, and cannot be explained by alternative approaches to judging existence. Consistent with standard setters' intentions, results also suggest that their proposed changes to the definitions of assets and liabilities—changes that attempt to clarify the intended role of probability—do cause a greater proportion of participants to indicate that the relevant financial statement element (asset or liability) exists, relative to participants with no definition.

Individual supervisor fixed effects explain twice as much variation in branch misconduct as firm fixed effects. Supervisor influence is concentrated in firms that theory suggests are most likely to delegate authority—firms with complex operations, distant branches, and trustworthy supervisors. Supervisors affect misconduct through their personnel decisions, attention to employees with past misbehavior, and ethics and industry rules training.

Zach Kowaleski,,2020,,"Abstract We study the role of reputation in auditor-client matching. Using 1.2 million employment records from US broker-dealers, we find that broker-dealer clients of the same auditor have similar financial adviser misconduct profiles. Our estimates indicate that variation in client misconduct behavior is nearly half as important as variation in client size in explaining matches. Auditors adjust their portfolios when presented with new information about client behavior, and those with the most significant reputation concerns are least likely to deal with high misconduct clients. Finally, we find that an auditor's reputation for accepting high misconduct clients predicts their new clients' future misconduct. Together, our results present new evidence on how reputation affects audit relationships, and the consequences of auditors' reputation concerns for client behavior. Our results also indicate an unintended consequence of audit mandates: non-discerning auditors emerge to serve clients with low endogenous demand for auditing.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),97.7777777777778,10.2139/ssrn.3326595,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45330847650d0f10cef4de86670e419719da304e,,,Goal 8,0.02046370148249136,False,

Our paper directly addresses concerns raised by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that the largest public accounting firms’ growth in their consulting practices threatens audit quality. We conduct an experiment proposed using a registration‐based editorial process. We compare a baseline where the auditor does not provide consulting services to conditions where auditors provide consulting to audit clients or where auditors only provide consulting services to non‐audit clients. Our unique design provides evidence on whether providing consulting to non‐audit clients strengthens the salience of a client‐cooperative social norm that reduces audit quality. We do not find differences in audit quality by condition in our planned analysis, however we find greater variation in audit quality in the conditions where auditors provide consulting services compared to the baseline. In unplanned analyses, our results suggest providing consulting services increases auditor cooperation with managers, increasing audit quality when managers prefer high audit quality and decreasing audit quality when managers prefer low audit quality.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/1475-679x.12197,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12197,,,Goal 1,0.01926544093499826,False,

The contracts are in the forms of a menu with linear compensation for demand or sales, incorporating inventory costs.

Guoming Lai,,2019,,"Competing firms may engage in group buying to benefit from quantity discount from the common supplier. There are two prevailing power structures in industry practice: Nash group buying in which two competing firms possess similar powers, and Stackelberg group buying in which one firm serves as the leader to initiate group buying contract. We investigate how the competitors' power structure affects their group buying behaviors and the performances of all stakeholders (including the supplier, the two firms, and the end consumers). Our paper is the first to study the impact of power structure on group buying between competitors in B2B context. We employ a game-theoretic framework in which two firms facing Cournot competition can group their purchase if it is beneficial over individual purchasing. As part of the framework, we model firms' group buying based on their endowed power structures. For each power structure, we derive equilibrium firm behaviors and characterize the conditions under which firms have a group buying incentive. We compare the group buying behaviors and performances across different power structures and demonstrate the determinant of power structure: Different power structures may fundamentally alter firms' group buying incentives. Furthermore, different power structures lead to different joint performance and neither form of group buying can dominate the others. Our results suggest that either Nash or Stackelberg group buying between competing firms may achieve Pareto improvement over individual purchasing in the sense that all the parties are better off. One distinctive insight is that when the two firms are highly asymmetric in their market bases, Nash group buying is unattainable due to severe co-opetition conflict and only Stackelberg group buying may be possible. Moreover, under certain conditions, the smaller-firm-led Stackelberg group buying (i.e., the smaller firm moves first and acts as the leader) can be Pareto optimal among all power structures.",Semantic Scholar (by DOI),100.0,10.2139/ssrn.3435526,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/def55004f3ff91c1bd352db2f67cad29dd5bc717,,,Goal 5,0.005432880907726093,False,
Guoming Lai,,2023,,"Problem definition: Modern technologies have made it viable for firms to lower the costs of switching on and off production in response to market changes. In this paper, we explore how production start–stop flexibility impacts joint operating policies, financing, and investment timing decisions. Methodology/results: We develop a continuous-time, optimal stopping model in which equity holders of the firm make operational decisions regarding pausing and restarting production as well as when to default. The degree of production flexibility is measured by switching costs. On the one hand, production flexibility influences the trade-off between tax shields and default costs for the capital structure decision; on the other hand, debt levels impact the equity holders’ incentive to use flexibility by pausing and restarting operations. We find that optimal debt usage is not monotone in production flexibility. Specifically, when switching costs are in a low region, the optimal debt level decreases slowly as switching costs increase. As switching costs increase into an intermediate region, the optimal debt level decreases sharply because the firm needs to reduce its debt to ensure the equity holders maintain flexible operating policies. However, when switching costs exceed a threshold, the cost of compromising the use of debt becomes excessive, and the firm substantially increases its debt to gain the full benefit of the tax shield; in so doing, the equity holders forgo flexibility and maintain production continuously until default. This financing strategy affects the firm’s investment timing decision, which also exhibits a nonmonotone pattern. Managerial implications: When a firm optimizes the debt usage and investment timing, the incentive of utilizing flexibility embedded in the production technology by the equity holders needs to be taken into account.

Guoming Lai,,2023,,"Companies have increasingly used supply chain financing instead of bank financing when engaging with financially constrained suppliers. We investigate the effectiveness of different financing mechanisms at supporting supply chain responsibility. We consider a decentralized supply chain where a buyer sources from a financially constrained supplier who borrows from either a bank or the buyer to finance his production. The buyer audits the supplier for responsibility compliance and will refuse to accept and pay for the order if the supplier fails the audit. We find that under conventional bank financing, the bank is concerned with the supplier's audit failure and will raise the interest rate. This not only hinders the supplier's compliance effort but also hurts the profitability of every stakeholder. In contrast, under buyer financing, the buyer may offer the supplier a low interest rate to motivate him to be more compliant when the supplier's collateral is of low value. However, if the supplier's collateral is of high value, the buyer may be tempted to set a high interest rate to exploit the supplier—leading to a reduction in supplier's compliance and supply chain profitability. Thus, we conclude that buyer (bank) financing is more preferable for encouraging responsibility when the supplier has low (high) collateral. Our findings suggest that buyer financing may not always be an effective approach for encouraging supply chain responsibility. As such, we propose an alternative mechanism under which the buyer offers a reward to the supplier if he passes the audit while the supplier continues to borrow from a bank. We prove that this combination of bank financing and buyer reward always improves the compliance level and in most cases increases the total supply chain profit. It is even more effective than buyer financing in encouraging responsibility especially when the supplier's collateral is of low value.",Crossref,80.2030456852792,10.1111/poms.14082,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.14082,,,Goal 9,0.02232048186443347,False,
Guoming Lai,,2023,,"Problem definition: We investigate the participation, competition, and welfare at platforms that focus on customer-intensive discretionary services, such as healthcare, legal, and business consulting. Academic/practical relevance: Such platforms have recently emerged in practice to provide a venue for independent professionals and service seekers to match online. Methodology: We develop a strategic queueing model, where the platform sets the commission rate, upon which service providers decide participation, service quality, and price, and consumers make service acquisition. Results: First, our study reveals that with heterogeneous consumers, the participating service providers may engage in both price and service competitions if the number of them is either small or large. They compete for attractive consumers in the former and for market share in the latter. In these regions, more service providers joining the platform can result in a lower service price and a higher service quality. Whereas, if the number of participating service providers is intermediate, only service competition arises, so that a higher service quality is associated with a higher service price. Second, we find that in our main model, the platform may set the commission rate sufficiently high to limit the number of participating service providers, so as to prevent intense price competition. In contrast, if the platform also controls the service price, it may set a higher service price and a lower commission rate, which boosts the participation of service providers and improves their service quality. As a result, platform price intervention may not only benefit the platform and the service providers, but also the consumers.

Guoming Lai,,2022,,"Classic inventory theories typically focus on the operational trade-offs to optimize inventory decisions.

Academic/practical relevance: Logistics is critical for e-commerce. It is intriguing that the third-party sellers that use FBA may directly compete with Amazon. By FBA, their service levels are substantially improved and so is their competitiveness. Such a phenomenon has been little investigated in prior literature. Methodology: We develop a strategic competition model where Amazon and a representative third-party seller engage in both price and service competition. Results: Interestingly, we find that although FBA may intensify the service competition between Amazon and the third-party seller, it can mitigate their price competition besides the direct revenue Amazon collects from the service. The latter effects dominate the former when the cross-service sensitivity of the consumers is either sufficiently low or sufficiently high. Therefore, not only the third-party sellers but also Amazon may benefit from FBA. Moreover, because the sales of Amazon’s products may increase because of FBA, its OEM (original equipment manufacturer) supplier may gain from FBA also. These findings extend to the settings where the third-party seller is Amazon’s OEM supplier, cross-price and cross-service sensitivities are correlated, or the parties set their retail prices sequentially.

Guoming Lai,,2022,,"Problem definition: Although it is well known that a reseller’s ability to hold strategic inventory under a short-term supply contract can potentially benefit both the reseller and a supplier, existing research on strategic inventory focuses almost exclusively on exclusive reselling environments. However, in practice, multiple suppliers often sell to the same nonexclusive reseller, and it is not uncommon for suppliers to ask for future commitments to order quantities from resellers in return for their own commitment to wholesale prices. We investigate how the possibility of strategic inventory influences competing suppliers’ choices between short-term transactional and long-term commitment contracts to a nonexclusive reseller. Methodology/results: Using a game-theoretic model, we consider the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a single, nonexclusive reseller over a two-period horizon in which demand is deterministic. We demonstrate that in nonexclusive reselling environments, where more than one supplier sells its product through the same reseller, the use of strategic inventory under short-term contracts intensifies the price competition between suppliers. We show how this effect can be mitigated when one or both suppliers offer a long-term contract. Moreover, we show that long-term contracts can arise as an equilibrium outcome, particularly when products are more substitutable or holding costs are large. Managerial implications: By considering the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a nonexclusive reseller in a multiperiod setting, we contribute to the literature on strategic contracting and long versus short-term contracts.

In particular, the tax consideration can make a multinational firm more inclined to procure materials by its overseas subsidiary and then resell the materials to the contract manufacturer to retain profit in the low tax jurisdiction. Such an effect can not only cause the firm to choose a more expensive material supplier but also overproduce the products. Therefore, besides the general concern of income shifting, tax considerations can further lead to operational distortions. We show that to reduce tax disparity while preventing tax exemption for shifted foreign profit may lead to a win‐win outcome for the firm and the home country stakeholders. The firm will make more efficient operational decisions to obtain a higher after‐tax profit at a certain reduced tax rate, while the home country stakeholders can receive more tax income. Interestingly, the foreign contract manufacturer may also benefit from such a change.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.13271,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13271,,,Goal 10,0.02347109380153647,False,
Guoming Lai,,2019,,"This paper studies an innovative agricultural partnership model in the dairy industry. In developing regions, farmers are constrained by limited resources, while it is costly for an enterprise to set up new facilities and raise dairy animals all on its own. Under the partnership model, dairy animals are raised by individual farmers during the maturing stage and then by the enterprise during the milking stage. This can lower the enterprise’s investment cost, ensure milk quality, and also expand the farmers’ capacity given that a new batch can be raised when the old batch goes to the enterprise’s facilities. We find that from the enterprise’s perspective, the performance of this model depends on the farmers’ original capacity and capacity expansion ratio (i.e., how much it can expand under partnership). The profitability of the enterprise can either increase in the farmers’ original capacity if the expansion ratio is small or decreases otherwise. Compared with the conventional decentralized model and the independent integrated model, the partnership model is particularly preferred when the enterprise’s market size is intermediate. Several extensions of our model show that the government quality subsidy offered to the farmers may sometimes lower dairy product quality as well as the enterprise’s profit; when the enterprise aims to maximize the total profit of the partnership, it will contract with more farmers and produce more dairy products; and if the farmers have more bargaining power, the partnership model will benefit the farmers more but be less preferable to the enterprise.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12992,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12992,,,Goal 2,0.0430131758982281,False,agricultural productivity; agriculture investment
Guoming Lai,,2019,,"This study studies discretionary healthcare services with consumption of medical goods (e.g., tests, drugs). Specifically, we focus on a setting where the service provider obtains revenue from the medical consumption, and the perceived service value improves while the amount of medical consumption decreases in the service time (e.g., due to more thorough inquiry and examination). We find that the equilibrium service and demand rates both decrease if the service provider’s share of revenue from the medical consumption decreases, or if the medical goods become more expensive. Moreover, the consumption of goods can reverse some well‐known results in models without goods: the service provider may reduce the service time when the perceived service value depends more heavily on the service time. From a policy perspective, we find that service price caps—often put in place to control medical costs—can lead to shorter service times and increased medical consumption. This effect is more severe when the service provider retains less revenue from the medical goods or when they are less expensive. Furthermore, without service price caps, facing a smaller market size, the service provider generally offers a longer service time inducing less medical consumption; however, this can be reversed with service price caps. Thus, in discretionary healthcare services accompanied by medical goods, price regulations may lead to wasteful consumption; extra attention is needed for certain market scenarios.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.13051,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13051,,,Goal 12,0.02137339088763563,False,consumer behavior
Guoming Lai,,2019,,"It is now widely accepted that a retailer’s use of strategic inventory can mitigate double marginalization and improve the coordination of a supply chain, potentially benefiting both the downstream retailer and an upstream manufacturer. However, this conclusion has typically been based on the assumption that the manufacturer can observe the retailer’s level of inventory before making wholesale pricing decisions. In reality, there are many situations in which neither the retailer’s sales nor inventory are observable to the manufacturer, effectively concealing the action taken by the retailer. We investigate the implications of such a lack of observability on the use of strategic inventory in a supply chain consisting of a single retailer and a single manufacturer. We find that the manufacturer’s inability to observe inventory has significant implications for the amount of inventory and the range of holding cost for which it is held in equilibrium. In addition, we find that, in the absence of any form of uncertainty, which the manufacturer could benefit from responding to, he may prefer not to observe the retailer’s inventory.

Guoming Lai,,2017,,"We study leader-based collective bargaining (LCB), under which a leading buyer (leader) and a following buyer (follower) form an alliance to jointly purchase a common component from a supplier. Although the leader and the follower cooperate in their component purchase, they compete in selling their end products. We first analyze the most common and simple form of LCB, equal price LCB, under which the follower pays to the leader the same wholesale price that the leader obtains from his negotiation with the supplier. We compare each buyer’s profit under the equal price LCB with the benchmark where each buyer purchases separately from the supplier. We find that although the alliance might obtain a lower wholesale price and although the leader is always better off under equal price LCB, the follower can be worse off if the competition intensity of the leader’s and follower’s products is within an intermediate region. We identify a competition effect resulting from equal price LCB that can place the follower at a disadvantage in the competition. This finding implies that the equal price LCB might not be sustainable in practice. In view of this limitation, we investigate an alternative form of LCB, fixed price LCB, under which the follower pays a fixed price to the leader regardless of the wholesale price the leader obtains from the supplier. We show that fixed price LCB benefits not only the leader but also the follower, compared with separate purchases, which implies that fixed price LCB always achieves a win–win outcome for the buyers.

Guoming Lai,,2017,,"Trade credit is a widely adopted industry practice. Prior research has focused on how trade credit benefits firms by improving vertical supply chain relationships. This paper offers a novel perspective by examining whether trade credit benefits suppliers through a horizontal channel. Under the classic Bertrand competition framework, we analyze two competing firms’ price decisions with and without trade credit. We find that when the firms are financially constrained, trade credit softens horizontal price competition. Specifically, with trade credit, the firms will behave less aggressively in setting their prices for fear of incurring additional financing costs, resulting in equilibrium prices above the marginal cost, even if the products are perfect substitutes. Equilibrium profits under trade credit may thus be strictly higher than those under cash contracts. Furthermore, we find that with trade credit, a financially stronger firm may be able to exclude its weaker competitor from the market. We also investigate the relationship between the firms’ financial strength and their physical capacity in the competition with trade credit. We find that the horizontal benefit of trade credit over cash contracts increases as either the firms’ physical capacities increase or their financial status weakens. Therefore, with trade credit, firms’ financial constraints are a partial substitute for the role that physical capacity plays in price competition. Finally, we study the firms’ choice between offering trade credit and cash contracts. We find that trade credit is the equilibrium contract form if customers value trade credit, suggesting that the horizontal benefit of trade credit may complement its vertical roles.",Crossref,100.0,10.1287/msom.2016.0608,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2016.0608,,,Goal 17,0.05241337261984542,True,global trade

We consider a multi‐period setting where two firms process a common commodity to meet stochastic demands. They can buy and sell the commodity through both the spot and forward markets. They can also share the commodity if one has leftover inventory while the other has excess demand. We first characterize the equilibrium strategies of the two firms. Our analysis reveals that in such a context, the value of inventory sharing is low when the forward price is directly used to value the sharing transactions. We then develop a structured trans‐shipment price scheme that uses a linear combination of the spot and forward prices. We show that this method can substantially increase the value of inventory sharing.

Guoming Lai,,2016,,"In the producer–seller relationship, the seller, besides his role of selling, is often in an ideal position to gather useful market information for the producer’s operations planning. Incentive alignment is critical to motivate both information-acquisition and sales efforts. Two popular contract forms are investigated. One is the forecast-based contract (FC) that requires the seller to submit a demand forecast: the seller obtains commissions from the realized sales but is also obliged to pay a penalty for any deviation of the sales from the forecast. The other is the classical menu of linear contracts (MLC), from which the seller can choose a contract that specifies a unique commission rate and a fixed payment. The conventional understanding suggests that the MLC is superior, but it is often assumed that information is exogenously endowed. In contrast, we find that, with an endogenous information-acquisition effort, the MLC may suffer from a conflicted moral hazard effect that creates friction between motivations for the two efforts. The FC can, however, decouple these two tasks and thus dominate the MLC. We further find that when ensuring interim participation is necessary (e.g., renegotiation cannot be prevented after information acquisition), the performance of the FC might be affected by the adverse selection effect because it is unable to effectively separate different types, at which the MLC excels. We show that when the demand and supply mismatch cost is substantial, the conflicted moral hazard effect dominates the adverse selection effect, and the FC is more efficient, and it is the converse otherwise. These findings can enrich the understanding of these two contract forms and are useful for sales and operations planning.

Guoming Lai,,2015,,"We analyze a dynamic bargaining game in which a seller and a buyer negotiate over quantity and payment to trade for a product. Both firms are impatient, and they make alternating offers until an agreement is reached. The buyer is privately informed about his type, which can be high or low: the high type's demand is stochastically larger than the low type's. In the dynamic negotiation process, the seller can screen, whereas the buyer can signal information through their offers, and the buyer has an endogenous and type-dependent reservation profit. With rational assumptions on the seller's belief structure, we characterize the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game. Interestingly, we find that both quantity distortion and information rent may be avoided depending on the firms' relative patience, and the seller may reach an agreement with either the high type or the low type first, or with both simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore our model to characterize the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm profitability. We find that improved demand forecast benefits the buyer but hurts the seller when the buyer's forecasting accuracy is low. However, once the buyer's forecasting accuracy exceeds a threshold, both firms will benefit from further improvement of the forecast. This observation makes an interesting contrast to previous findings based on the one-shot principal–agent model, in which improvement of forecasting accuracy mostly leads to a win–lose outcome for the two firms, and the buyer has an incentive to improve his forecasting accuracy only when it is extremely low.

In particular, theoretically equivalent hedging strategies have very different sensitivities to model error, with one natural strategy exhibiting potentially catastrophic performance in the presence of small model errors. We propose effective approaches to mitigate the negative effect of futures term-structure model error on hedging, also taking into account futures contract illiquidity, and provide theoretical justification for some of these approaches.

We then investigate the inspection mechanism and characterize the equilibrium. We find that under the inspection mechanism, the optimal procurement quantity is no less than the first best.

Guoming Lai,,2015,,"The objective of this study was to extend existing understanding of supplier encroachment to contexts in which there is information asymmetry and the supplier can use nonlinear pricing. Prior research has shown that supplier encroachment can mitigate double marginalization and thus benefit both the supplier and the reseller. However, under symmetric information, this benefit disappears if the supplier can use nonlinear pricing. In our model, the reseller observes the true market size while the supplier knows only the prior distribution, that is, a seemingly ideal setting for implementing mechanism design through nonlinear pricing. We first show that, because encroachment capability enables the supplier to make an ex post output decision, it fundamentally alters the structure of the optimal nonlinear pricing policy. In addition to the usual downward distortion effect, where the reseller may purchase less than the efficient quantity, we also have the possibility for upward distortion. Thus, under asymmetric information and nonlinear pricing, supplier encroachment has two opposing effects. On one hand, the ability to shift sales to the direct channel allows the supplier to reduce information rents with less sacrifice of efficiency; but on the other hand, by introducing the possibility of her own opportunistic behavior, it can result in upward distortion of the quantities sold through the reselling channel, which is a new source of inefficiency. Depending upon the relative efficiency of the reselling channel and the demand distribution, either of these two effects may dominate and the supplier's ability to encroach may either benefit or hurt both the supplier and the reseller.",Crossref,100.0,10.1111/poms.12210,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.12210,,,Goal 9,0.008505198696483338,False,

Yan Leng,,2024,,"Machine learning is commonly used to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in randomized experiments. Using large-scale randomized experiments on Facebook and Criteo platforms, we observe substantial discrepancies between machine learning-based treatment effect estimates and difference-in-means estimates directly from the randomized experiment. This paper provides a two-step framework for practitioners and researchers to diagnose and rectify this discrepancy. We first introduce a diagnostic tool to assess whether bias exists in the model-based estimates from machine learning. If bias exists, we then offer a model-agnostic method to calibrate any HTE estimates to known, unbiased, subgroup difference-in-means estimates, ensuring that the sign and magnitude of the subgroup estimates approximate the model-free benchmarks. This calibration method requires no additional data and can be scaled for large data sets.

To operationalize these social science theories, we empirically identify the homophilous communities and use the community structures to capture such “roles”, affecting particular decision-making processes.

We tested this hypothesis in a pre-registered experiment where 1670 Republicans and Democrats in the United States were asked to complete an online social learning task with a bot that was labeled as a member of the opposing party. Prior to this task, we exposed respondents to primes about (a) a common enemy (involving Iran and Russia); (b) a patriotic event; or (c) a neutral, apolitical prime. Though we observed no significant differences in the behavior of Democrats as a result of priming, we found that Republicans—and particularly those with very strong conservative views—were significantly less likely to learn from Democrats when primed about a common enemy. Because our study was in the field during the 2020 Iran Crisis, we were able to further evaluate this finding via a natural experiment—Republicans who participated in our study after the crisis were even less influenced by the beliefs of Democrats than those Republicans who participated before this event. These findings indicate common enemies may not reduce inter-group conflict in highly polarized societies, and contribute to a growing number of studies that find evidence of asymmetric political polarization in the United States.

Yan Leng,,2022,,"Location-Based Social Networks have been widely studied in recent years; new approaches constantly developed to solve individuals’ trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods require sufficient data to learn individual features, which is not always satisfied in real situations, especially for online data. The digital data on human behavior typically follows a power-law distribution, indicating that only a few people have rich activities recorded while most people’s behavioral data are limited. In order to overcome this hurdle, our work constructs the user behavior proximity network (UBPN) and proposes a new walking strategy based on this network that extracts the hidden information from the social contacts to substitute the unobserved behavioral information of an individual. Specifically, our proposed walking strategy has two walking paths, accounting for the temporal and social information on the ego users’ and their alters’ mobility activities. This walking strategy is model-agnostic and can be integrated with many existing walk-based deep learning methods.

We test the effectiveness of contextual centrality in predicting the eventual outcomes in the adoption of microfinance and weather insurance. Our empirical analysis shows that the contextual centrality of first-informed individuals has higher predictive power than that of other standard centrality measures. Further simulations show that when the diffusion occurs locally, contextual centrality can identify nodes whose local neighborhoods contribute positively.

In this paper, we focus on online service providers over which users reveal preferences (e.g., ratings or reviews) as publicly available behavioral data. We model users' strategic interactions in making these decisions as quadratic games on networks, where a user's payoff depends not only on their actions but also on their neighbors in a social interaction network. Based on the assumption that the observed preferences correspond to the Nash equilibrium of the game, we investigate whether eavesdroppers or competitors having access to such behavioral data could potentially infer or even thoroughly learn the hidden social interaction network from the observed user actions, leading to privacy risks at a system level for the platform. We introduce three notions of privacy risks on networks: fundamental privacy, conditional privacy, and practical privacy. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for fundamental and conditional privacy of the social interaction structure, suggesting that at the system level, such interaction structure is not facing a critical risk of being fully exposed regardless of the amount of data available. To study practical privacy, we further propose and analyze a novel learning framework by solving a joint optimization problem for the network structure and the individual marginal benefits in the game. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, hence illustrating that behavioral data indeed present substantial privacy risks in practice.

Traditional models assume that firms interact only as competitors. We examine and model “Collaborative Industries,” which afford rival firms opportunities to meaningfully collaborate. For example, in some industries, firms compete to win business, but then work together to complete production (e.g., through subcontracting). Firms in Collaborative Industries have powerful ways to reward or punish each other beyond raising or lowering the prices they offer to customers. These mechanisms create much greater scope for collusion than economic models conventionally recognize. 
 
We show that Collaborative Industries can sustain anticompetitive collusive behavior no matter how unconcentrated the industry becomes. In some instances, lower market concentration makes collusion easier; smaller firms may be more dependent on collaboration with rivals and thus may be easier to punish if they undercut collusion.

However, models that examine these effects for digital and viral media are still evolving. Given resistance to advertising, firms often seek to promote their own viral content to boost brand awareness. However, a key shortcoming of virality is its ephemeral nature. To gain insight into sustaining virality, we develop a quasi-experimental approach that estimates the backward spillover onto a focal platform by introducing a piece of content onto a new platform. We posit that introducing content to the audience of a new platform can generate word of mouth, which may affect its consumption within an earlier platform. We estimate these spillovers using data on 381 viral videos on 26 platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) and observe how consumption of videos on an initial “lead” platform is affected by their subsequent introduction onto “lag” platforms. This spillover is estimated as follows: for each multiplatform video, we compare its view growth after being introduced onto a new platform to that of a synthetic control based on similar single-platform videos. Analysis of 275 such spillover scenarios reveals that introducing a video onto a lag platform roughly doubles its subsequent view growth in the lead platform. This positive cross-platform spillover is persistent, bursty, and strongest in the first 42 days. We find that spillover is boosted when the video is consumed more in the lag platform, when the consumption rate peaks earlier in the lag platform, and when the lag platform targets a foreign market. Our findings suggest that firms can sustain the popularity of their viral content by introducing it onto additional platforms (e.g., Vimeo) after posting it on a focal platform (e.g., YouTube). As a result of their posting on the latter platforms, firms can expect subsequent view growth on the focal platform to roughly double. The aforementioned benefits persists for up to five lag platforms. Platforms should also consider that a positive cross-platform spillover may help platforms reinforce each other’s usage, rather than cannibalize each other.",Crossref,88.3333333333333,10.1287/isre.2019.0897,https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2019.0897,,,Goal 8,0.01434566820284399,False,

Luis Martins,,2023,,"In contrast to the prevalent outside-in perspectives on corporate purpose as a response to competing normative demands of stakeholders, we introduce an inside-out perspective on purpose as based in firm-specific, agentic commitments to specific values, ideals, and societal goals. Drawing on moral philosophy, we propose how strategists can develop a strategic purpose through moral imagination that involves developing shaping intentions based in values and ideals, empathetic relating, and imaginativeness in stakeholder contexts. These processes support the generation of an emergent theory of value, which we term “the collective desirable.” This theory of value—a creative synthesis of the shaping intentions of the firm, and the interests and perspectives of stakeholders—provides the foundation of purpose, which is strategic, dynamic, and generative for the firm and its stakeholders. Such a strategic purpose becomes an organizational logic of action enacted through designated processes for articulation, maintenance, and evolvability, and through blueprints for credible commitments and resource allocations. By theorizing the microfoundations of an agentic, inside-out view of purpose, our theoretical framework articulates a set of mechanisms through which strategists can develop a strategic purpose that is tightly linked to the firm’s future-oriented strategy and the exercise of moral leadership.

We argue that continuous or near futures are likely to be perceived as more plausible, whereas discontinuous or distant futures are likely to be perceived as more desirable by stakeholder audiences. We further draw on Ricœur’s ideas about narrative time to theorize how narratives are used by firms for temporal reorganization that can alter perceptions of plausibility and desirability, thereby increasing the overall persuasiveness of their futurescapes.

By theorizing choice as an information and decision problem, behavioral strategy research has not considered fully the agentic capacities of strategists. We argue that agentic capacities are distinct from decision-making and information-processing capacities as they rest on temporally anchored engagements with the world through habit, imagination, and judgment. We propose that understanding agency as temporally anchored action capacities is particularly important for research in behavioral strategy, as strategic phenomena encompass accumulated experience and path-dependencies (the past), ongoing competitive, market, and organizational interactions and exchanges (the present), and plans, visions, and forecasts for the future (the future).

We build on psychological research on personal values to propose that values are complex cognitive resources, distinct from mental representations, beliefs, ideologies, identities, and emotions, that, when deployed in strategy making, affect the attributes of the strategies created. We specify how values affect the value-creation and value-capture potential of firms’ strategies by theorizing four distinct functions of values in strategy making: as attentional structures, as valuation lenses, as design principles, and as identity markers. As attentional structures, values direct strategists’ attention to specific issues and often unconventional solutions; as valuation lenses, they change the evaluation of relevant markets and resources; as design principles, they influence the prioritization and integration of activities; and as identity markers, they facilitate audience engagement and mobilization.

However, studies that have investigated a link between advertising and firm value have only sometimes found that link. Meta-analysis has failed to determine moderators that govern the link between advertising and firm value.

Advertising cannot build brand equity for a cost leader because such a firm has no point of difference on which to build. Identifying differentiators and cost leaders on the basis of firms’ reactions to a change in accounting regulations, the authors confirm hypotheses: advertising is related to sales for all firms, but it is more strongly related to firm value for differentiators than for cost leaders.

Although one might conclude that their impacts on bankruptcy risk are merely the inverse of their impacts on shareholder value, we argue otherwise and show that the differences hinge on the fact that shareholder value is a function of expected cash flows from all future periods, whereas bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from only the next period. We show that current market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&D assets on expected cash flow from the next period but not on expected cash flows from more distant future periods. Therefore, market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&D assets on bankruptcy risk but not shareholder value.

John McInnis,,2017,,"Abstract We survey commercial bank lenders to better understand how they evaluate and react to variation in financial statement quality and how they view recent changes in accounting standards. A unique aspect of this study is that our respondents focus on medium‐size loans to private companies. In fact, more than 90 percent of the survey respondents primarily make credit decisions on loans between $250 thousand and $50 million. This is in contrast to prior archival research, which focuses primarily on very large loans to public firms or very small loans to private firms. We find that lenders in our sample distinguish among financial statements in terms of quality, including conservatism, primarily on the basis of accrual patterns and restatements. While this general result holds throughout our sample, financial statement quality is substantially more important for lenders making larger loans (over $10 million) as compared to very small loans (under $1 million). In addition, bank lenders are much more likely to respond to low‐quality reporting with collateral and guarantee requirements than with an increase in the interest rate charged. This finding is consistent for lenders making both larger and smaller loans. Finally, despite concerns in the academic literature, bank lenders in our sample actually hold a neutral‐to‐positive view of recent changes in accounting standards.

Further, there is no evidence on the mechanism linking control strength to fraud risk. We find a strong association between material weaknesses and future fraud revelation.

One of the distinctive features of our model is that it incorporates limits on the number of transshipments for each container, a common service requirement in practice. These limits can vary by shipment attributes such as origin and destination, and cargo priority. We propose a new stage-indexed multi-commodity flow model that is based on an augmented network containing links (representing sub-paths) between every pair of ports visited by a candidate service.

Although telehealth has been proposed as a potential solution to improve access to care and restrain runaway healthcare costs, it can increase spending if telehealth use leads to new types of resource utilization. Drawing on the lens of process virtualization theory, we study the impact of telehealth on healthcare utilization by examining visit-level patient data of telehealth use in facilitating e-visits with healthcare providers. On average, a telehealth visit reduces the number of future outpatient visits by 13.6% (or 0.15 visits), equal to a reduction of $239 in total cost within 30 days after the visit. Our results suggest that the benefits of telehealth use are observed primarily among diseases with high virtualization potential. Specifically, patients with mental health, skin, metabolic, and musculoskeletal diseases exhibit a significant reduction of 0.21 outpatient visits per quarter (an equivalent cost reduction of $179) when they are treated via telehealth, suggesting a substitution effect with respect to traditional clinic visits. Our research identifies the boundary conditions that determine the nuanced impact of telehealth on care utilization and shows that its effectiveness depends on the process virtualization potential of different diseases.

Further, the role of hospital information integration in moderating the impact of SDOH on ER utilization has not received adequate attention. Utilizing longitudinal claims data from a regional health information exchange spanning 6 years including the COVID-19 period, we study how SDOH affects ER utilization and whether effective integration of patient health information across hospitals can moderate its impact. Our results suggest that a patient's economic well-being significantly reduces future ER utilization. The magnitude of this relationship is significant when patients are treated at hospitals with high information integration but is weaker when patients receive care at hospitals with lower levels of information integration. Instead, patients' family and social support can reduce ER utilization when they are treated at hospitals with low information integration. In other words, different dimensions of SDOH are important in low versus high information integration conditions. Furthermore, predictive modeling shows that patient visit type and prior visit history can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of ER utilization. Our research implications support efforts to develop national standards for the collection and sharing of SDOH data and their use and interpretation for clinical decision making by healthcare providers and policy makers.",,0.0,,,,,Goal 3,0.09465936000201358,True,health infrastructure

The methodology also measures predictor variable worth (for determining target behavior group membership) at a predictor variable category-by-category level, so different variable response categories can contain different amounts of information about classification.

With USD 1.6 trillion in contracts under guarantees, VAGB had become a vast and lucrative part of life insurer activities. But the guarantees expose insurers to market risk. Our analysis suggests that those risks were insufficiently hedged. Second, we assess the cumulative magnitude of all derivative risks (including VAGB risks) and find that they probably do not rise to level of a systemic threat.

The emerging paradigm recognizes that the unscientific samples that currently dominate behavioral intervention research cannot produce reliable estimates of an intervention’s real-world impact. Similarly, unqualified references to an intervention’s “true effect” are rarely warranted. Rather, the variation in effect estimates across studies that defines the current replication crisis is to be expected, even in the absence of false positives, as long as heterogeneous effects are studied without a systematic approach to sampling. Finally, when studied effectively, heterogeneity in treatment effects can be harnessed to build more complete theories of causal mechanism that could provide nuanced and dependable guidance to policy-makers.

Across each of these domains, we present a body of organizational behavior research that finds evidence of the influence of emotional contagion on a variety of attitudinal, cognitive, and behavioral/performance outcomes as well as identify the key boundary conditions of the emotional contagion phenomenon. To support future scholarship in this domain, we identify several new frontiers of emotional contagion research, including the need to better understand the “tipping point” of positive versus negative emotional contagion, the phenomenon of counter-contagion, and the influence of computer mediated communication and technology within organizations and society on emotional contagion.

Wealthier retirees have higher annuity demand when health shocks are considered, and increased longevity increases demand even more when retirees expect an expansion or slight morbidity compression. With health shocks and expectations of severe morbidity compression considered, the opposite effect might occur.

For the case of a multi-wave epidemic as represented by our compartmental model with behavioral feedback, we find that none of the alternative policies offers consistently more efficient allocations than a simple pro-rata policy across a broad range of behavioral parameter settings. In fact, in some cases the alternative policies may actually result in less efficient allocations than the pro-rata policy. Thus our results support the conclusion that the widely used pro-rata policy can be well justified because it is simple to explain/implement and does not cause unexpected adverse effects.

The hospital may also realize gains or losses from its internal operations. It may incentivize physicians to select certain treatment levels that improve quality and reduce costs by offering to share gains and losses. CMS has placed restrictions on what gains or losses may be shared and implemented stop‐loss and stop‐gain (SLSG) provisions for the hospital and the physicians. In this study, we consider a class of affine gainsharing functions that calculate a physician’s per‐episode share based on both the aggregate performance across all physicians, and the cost and quality outcomes achieved by that physician. We show that when there are no sharing restrictions and no SLSG provisions, an optimal gainsharing function lies in the class of affine functions. In contrast, when there are SLSG constraints, the contract design problem is analytically challenging. Therefore, we perform a series of numerical experiments, which reveal that the hospital SLSG provisions, the maximum savings potential, and the hospital’s risk preferences determine the amount of gains and losses that the hospitals share and the resulting treatment levels.

Pharmaceutical companies often find such markets financially unattractive because the opportunity cost of capacity commitment is high, developing countries have limited ability to pay, and demand is uncertain. A contract design recently implemented by one GHO offers the manufacturer a per‐dose sales subsidy, which is paid by the GHO, on top of the base price paid by developing countries. The subsidy is required because the base price is not enough, by itself, to induce the manufacturer to commit capacity for developing‐country markets. A natural question that arises in this context is whether, within a fixed budget, alternate contract designs lead to higher capacity commitment. This study proposes and analyzes three contract designs that include the current practice and two alternatives inspired by contracts studied in the operations management literature. It also considers two types of budget constraints that may arise in practice and quantifies the impact of each type of budget constraint on the manufacturer’s capacity commitment. We show that the best contract design depends on the size of the budget, and that GHOs can increase capacity commitment (over the contract design used in practice) by choosing the budget‐appropriate contract design and optimal parameters for the chosen design.",Crossref,0.0,10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u26828,https://doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u26828,,,Goal 17,0.05153632887920597,True,fiscal capacity

The OR manager has access to historical case count and case length data, and needs to balance the fixed cost of baseline staff and variable cost of overtime, while satisfying surgeons’ preferences. Academic/practical relevance: ORs are costly to operate and generate about 70% of hospitals’ revenues from surgical operations and subsequent hospitalizations. Because hospitals are increasingly under pressure to reduce costs, it is important to make staffing and scheduling decisions in an optimal manner. Also, hospitals need to leverage data when developing algorithmic solutions, and model tradeoffs between staffing costs and surgeons’ preferences. We present a methodology for doing so, and test it on real data from a hospital. Methodology: We propose a new criterion called the robust competitive ratio for designing online algorithms. Using this criterion and a robust optimization approach to model the uncertainty in case mix and case lengths, we develop tractable optimization formulations to solve the staffing and scheduling problems. Results: For the staffing problem, we show that algorithms belonging to the class of interval classification algorithms achieve the best robust competitive ratio, and develop a tractable approach for calculating the optimal parameters of our proposed algorithm. For the scheduling phase, which occurs one or two days before each surgery day, we demonstrate how a robust optimization framework may be used to find implementable schedules while taking into account surgeons’ preferences such as back-to-back and same-OR scheduling of cases. We also perform numerical experiments with real and synthetic data, which show that our approach can significantly reduce total staffing cost. Managerial implications: We present algorithms that are easy to implement and tractable. These algorithms also allow the OR manager to specify the size of the uncertainty set and to control overtime costs while meeting surgeons’ preferences.",,0.0,,,,,Goal 17,0.01433747140439642,False,

Our contribution lies in operationalizing this idea with the help of algorithms that utilize thresholds. Moreover, we show that if non-optimal thresholds are chosen, then those may lead to poor CRs.

They provide three main types of services: surgical services, emergency services, and inpatient services. In addition, some hospitals have outpatient clinics and facilities in which specialist consults and surgical services are provided on an outpatient basis. What challenges do hospital managers face in matching supply and demand for hospital services while maintaining service quality and keeping costs low? To what extent and how has the Operations Management (OM) literature contributed to addressing these challenges? What are emerging trends in practice? What opportunities and additional challenges do they pose for the OM researchers? This monograph is the authors’ attempt to address the questions posed above. Although service capacity could very well be defined in terms of the numerical count of physical and human resources, we have chosen to focus on the three main types of services that hospitals provide. In doing so, we expose the interconnectedness of these services and the challenges that arise due to the cascading effects of mismatches in any one area on all other hospital operations. Our goal is to expose key issues from practitioner perspectives, use representative data to highlight problems that are amenable to modeling using operations management tools, summarize state of the art in modeling such problems, and identify opportunities for future research. The monograph underscores several important observations. First, hospital administrators need to consider forces affecting demand and supply for services both inside and outside the hospital walls. Specifically, the option to shape and smooth demand for services, which is often underutilized, may provide significant new opportunities to lower the cost of matching demand and supply. Second, hospitals need both careful advance planning, based on patterns observed in historical data, as well as dynamic response strategies to unfolding reality that forces inevitable deviations from plans. Effective dynamic response may require administrators to invest in building alliances with other hospitals and flexibility (e.g. contingent staff). Third, the role of hospitals is changing. Innovations in payment mechanisms that bundle payment to hospitals and doctors, and offer incentives for lowering costs, are creating the need to design and implement effective gainsharing plans. These same forces have also increased the importance for hospital administrators of choosing the right number and specialization of salaried physicians, and building alliances with both upstream (e.g. primary care clinics) and downstream (e.g. skilled nursing facilities) service providers.

To study this question, we develop an investment game in which, if the investor chooses to invest, the manager privately observes production costs, chooses their personal pay, and provides a cost report in one of three reporting regimes: aggregated, disaggregated without discretion, or disaggregated with discretion. In Experiment 1, as predicted, managers report lower personal pay under both disaggregated regimes than what they consume under the aggregated regime. Yet, when disaggregated reports allow for discretion, managers misclassify personal pay as production costs to such an extent that their actual consumption is no different than in the aggregated condition. In Experiment 2, we allow managers to choose either an aggregated report or a disaggregated report with discretion. We find that, rather than remaining silent, the vast majority of managers still prefer the opportunity to report on their pay explicitly so that they can use their reporting discretion to appear trustworthy, despite not actually being so. In summary, our evidence suggests a strong weight of preferences for appearing trustworthy in the managers' utility function, a much lower weight for actually being trustworthy, and little evidence that preferences for being honest are strong enough for discretionary disaggregated reporting to curb agency costs. In other words, whether disaggregation can reduce agency costs will depend on managers' reporting discretion.

However, no formal test exists, so researchers have to rely on visual inspection. Even with a formal test, researchers still need to know how to balance the bias-efficiency trade-off for the estimate. We fill this void and advance the two-step synthetic control (TSSC) approach that comprises a formal test for the SC pretrends assumption in the first step and recommends an appropriate method that balances the dual goal of reducing bias and increasing efficiency in the second step.

The factor model approach to estimate treatment effects accommodates a large number of control units and can easily handle a large number of treatment units while flexibly allowing for cases where the treatment is outside the range of the control units. However, the factor model method lacks formal inference theory, instead relying on bootstrap or permutation procedures with strong assumptions.

The approach enables formal quantification of uncertainty through hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. The inference method is applicable to both stationary and nonstationary data. More importantly, the inference theory accommodates treatment and control unit outcomes with different distributions, which includes different error variances as a special case.

Within platform-based ecosystems, what drives platform owners' investment decision to enable third-party complements onto their platforms? Departing from the conventional focus on the complementarity value that these complements add to platform owners, we examine how uncertainty in the complementary product market drives this decision. We offer a novel perspective on third-party complements—they contain option value allowing the platform owner to defer its own entry into the market. Thus, uncertainty increases investment in enabling complements, especially with greater “downside risk” in the market or learning-by-observing. We demonstrate this perspective using numerical examples, simulations, and data on Apple's iPhone ecosystem from 2010 to 2015.

The result is that, among other things, the nature of their value exchange is likely different. To address this gap, we create a novel framework. The value creation lens is grounded in theory and creates a better understanding of the dynamics of platform creation and growth by separating the platform's value into three components: (1) the standalone value of the product, such as a smartphone's ability to take pictures, (2) the value of other participants on the platform, such as the number of friends on Instagram or merchants on eBay, and (3) the value created by complementary products from third-party providers, such as apps for a smartphone.

However, little is known statistically about whether this disparity is caused by liver compartment size, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease adjustments, or regional differences.

Methods: We use retrospective data from the United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Treatment Analysis and Research data files for liver transplantation from 1995 through 2012. The final sample consists of 150,149 patients. These data contain information on all individuals who registered for the liver transplant waiting list as well as updated outcome data. Linear probability and logistic regression models were both used.

Results: Women were 4.8 percentage points less likely to receive a transplant. Adjustment for race, weight, body mass index, region, education, and other characteristics attenuated the sex difference by roughly 19% (from 4.8 to 3.9 percentage points). The disparity was consistent across the 11 United Network for Organ Sharing allocation regions. Comparing the heaviest women to the lightest men, the disparity flipped. Pairwise comparisons between men and women of various sizes suggest that disparities in favor of men increase with the ratio of male-to-female size.

Conclusion: Our results document persistent sex disparity in liver transplantation, only 19% of which is explained by size differentials between men and women. Differences in rates of transplantation are increasing in the ratio of male-to-female height and weight, suggesting that some of the disparity is explained by differences in liver compartment size.

However, regime change, even when essentially peaceful, occurs in a dynamically complex environment that renders often counterintuitive results. For example, when a government falls to an insurgency (peaceful or otherwise), the establishment of the new regime is often not the end of the story. In particular, new regimes often find themselves faced by their own insurrections and may very likely be overthrown by them. Thus begins a domino-like chain of serial insurrections and regime changes, which typically create immense havoc. Much has been written on why traditional governments fall to insurgencies in the first place and how connectivity can promote this. However, this paper uses the methodology of system dynamics to posit that increases in connectivity may not only increase the probability of overthrowing a traditional regime, it may also increase the likelihood of a series of rapid, successful insurgencies that result in multiple regime changes. We also examine how various interactions between the regime (s) and populace lead to other unforeseen results. One finding that stands out is that connectivity may very well increase the likelihood that the end result of a series of insurgencies will be less popular among the citizenry than the regime that was initially overthrown.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=ega7598,The Effect of Increased Connectivity on Serial Regime Change,"Information, Risk, and Operations Management",Goal 9,0.01665626553338673,False,

This discussion serves to highlight the benefits of developing extended formulations and embedding constraints within the network representation, underscoring the importance of using strong formulations to effectively solve integer programs such as the RADR problems.

Research shows that loneliness carries numerous negative outcomes for individuals and casts loneliness as an individual problem that requires individual-oriented solutions. This view ignores the possibility that loneliness is symptomatic of a broader organizational problem, and further that organizations may be a root cause of widespread loneliness. This conceptual paper develops a framework that construes loneliness as a collective-level property; a crucial indicator that the relationships organizations need to be resilient during crises are deficient. We theorize a dynamic system in which the attention paid to relationships at the organizational-level continually shapes and is shaped by the quality of relationships emerging at lower levels. We adopt the attention-based view to outline how different patterns of attention are animated by different configurations of structures for building relationships, creating distinct relational systems. We contrast three prototypical relational systems: relational advocacy, relational antipathy, and relational indifference.

Thus, it is important for IT groups in organizations to understand how to deal with such difficulties for improved outsourcing performance. We study whether firms learn over time to deal with these two related but distinct issues in IT and business process outsourcing. Does such learning affect financial value appropriation through outsourcing? We build on the literature in information systems and strategy to investigate whether value creation in outsourcing depends on relational learning that results from prior association with the vendor, and procedural learning that results from prior experience in managing interfirm relationships. We estimate value in terms of long-term abnormal stock returns to the client relative to an industry, size, and book-to-market matched sample of control firms following the implementation of the outsourcing contract. We also analyze announcement period returns and allied wealth effects. Using data from the hundred largest outsourcing deals between 1996 and 2005, we find that whereas relational learning influences value creation in both simple and complex outsourcing engagements, procedural learning impacts value only in complex initiatives. Financial markets are slow to price the value of learning. The results suggest that caution should be exercised when firms without the experience of managing interfirm relationships externalize complex tasks to vendors they have not worked with in the past. Furthermore, IT groups can help improve learning-based outcomes by developing processes and systems that enable a firm to improve outsourcing procedures in a cumulative manner and also to coordinate and collaborate with the vendor.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=barua,The Impact of Firm Learning on Value Creation in Strategic Outsourcing Relationships,"Information, Risk, and Operations Management",Goal 4,0.02314364984668193,False,

This rapid assessment needs to occur as the disaster unfolds and immediately after the disaster, even while data is scarce and emerging. Marketing communication techniques and modern information technology methods (machine learning, geospatial information, and social media text mining) can help with these tasks.

This paper shows how to use predictive modeling and geospatial interpolation along with machine learning for pre-disaster community planning, for risk management actions during the disaster, and for assisting in creating informed structure regulations to assist in disaster resilience. As disaster response is an ongoing process, the technique provides a framework of spatial level loss estimation using limited evolving data and iteratively improves estimation as more data becomes available.

In response, Medicare reform efforts have been testing various payment and service delivery models, including accountable care organizations (ACOs), aiming to reduce expenditures while preserving or enhancing the coordination of quality care. The idea behind ACOs is to form an organizational network to coordinate all care for Medicare beneficiaries and in so doing, at least theoretically, improve quality of care and hopefully reduce medical costs. The purpose of this research is to apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the potential savings of Medicare obtainable through optimally efficient implementation of ACOs and Medicare Advantage plans. DEA comparisons across plans achieve this purpose by identifying which Medicare plans operate relatively more efficiently and which are inefficient, and additionally, for inefficient plans, the DEA analysis generates target levels of “inputs” and “outputs” required to bring the plan into efficient operation. Knowing sources of inefficiency can also provide insights into Medicare reform, such as Medicare privatization and innovation models. Our results show that Medicare Advantage plans are more efficient in reducing health expenditures but incur higher administrative costs.

Abstract
Recent research shows that more highly concentrated portfolios produce superior risk-adjusted returns. The untested premise is that it is the most skillful managers who hold the most concentrated portfolios. In this article, the authors formally examine the implicit assertion that the initial portfolio concentration decision is related to a manager’s inherent investment skill. First, they present a theoretical model indicating that the greater the manager’s skill level, the more concentrated the portfolio should be. Second, they conduct a simulation analysis of the capacity to make accurate ex ante security return forecasts; they show that skilled managers would select as few as 5% of the available securities and that the portfolio concentration decision is directly proportional to investment prowess. Finally, they provide an empirical examination of the actual skill–concentration relationship for actively managed equity mutual funds over 2002–2015 and document that managers who demonstrated past skill do form portfolios with higher concentration levels. The authors conclude that talented asset managers should and actually do hold more concentrated portfolios and that the extent of this concentration decision is meaningfully related to forecasting skill.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=kcbrown,"The Decision to Concentrate: Active Management, Manager Skill, and Portfolio Size",Finance,Goal 16,0.007634045550008554,False,

However, we find that half of the endowments revised their rules at least once and, on average, about a quarter of the sample changed their spending policies each year, implying a retention rate far lower than expected. We show that larger endowments with lower historical portfolio returns and lower past payout levels are more likely to alter their future spending formulas, but that institutions having the ability to invoke special appropriations on a temporary basis are less likely to make adjustments to their permanent rules. Further, we document that both spending rule changes and asset allocation adjustments persist over time and that, consistent with hypothesized behavior, the former tends to lead the latter.

We tested a perspective-taking approach to decreasing attitude entrenchment. Participants were held accountable in a task in which they wrote about a controversial issue from the perspective of a partner with an opposing viewpoint. This approach was effective at changing views on controversial issues—in Study 1 on weight discrimination, an issue participants were unlikely to have thought much about, and in Study 2 on abortion, where beliefs tend to be more deeply held. Studies 3 and 4 showed this change only took place under conditions where participants met the individual with an opposing view in person, and where that individual would see the perspective-taking effort. These results suggest that it is possible to reduce attitude entrenchment by encouraging people to think about the opposing perspective of another, as long as there is real contact and accountability.

Yet, how these antecedents translate into outcomes may depend on what employees speak up about and its implications for implementation. We engage in three studies to explore what individuals speak up about, why they speak up about those things, and the consequences of voicing such content. First, through a qualitative field study, we find evidence for three dimensions of voice content: the importance of initiating change, the required resources to enact the desired change, and the interdependencies involved in implementing the desired change. Further, specific targets of identification—either one’s local work unit or one’s broader profession—shape whether the issues individuals raise take into account barriers related to resources and interdependencies. Next, in a quantitative field study, we find that voicing on issues related to one’s work unit or profession mediates the relationship between employee identification and managers’ valuation of voice. Finally, in an experiment, we manipulate importance, resources, and interdependencies of implementation and find these dimensions of voice content influence managerial value of voice. These results offer meaningful theoretical implications for the literatures on employee voice and identification.

Journal of Applied Psychology. 100, 6 (2015), 1765-1784.",2015,Who gets credit for input? Demographic and structural status cues in voice recognition,"The authors investigate the employee features that, alongside overall voice expression, affect supervisors’ voice recognition. Drawing primarily from status characteristics and network position theories, the authors propose and find in a study of 693 employees from 89 different credit union units that supervisors are more likely to credit those reporting the same amount of voice if the employees have higher ascribed or assigned (by the organization) status—cued by demographic variables such as majority ethnicity and full-time work hours. Further, supervisors are more likely to recognize voice from employees who have higher achieved status—cued by their centrality in informal social structures. The authors also find that even when certain groups of lower status employees speak up more, they cannot compensate for the negative effect of their demographic membership on voice recognition by their boss. The authors underscore how recognition of employee voice by supervisors matters for employees. It carries (mediates) the effects of voice expression and status onto performance evaluations 1 year later, which means that demographic differences in the assignment of credit for voice can serve as an implicit pathway for discrimination.

However that intuition has been shown to impair good recommendations as demonstrated by some well-known results in the stochastic optimization literature. Our work on multiattribute ranking and selection procedures demonstrates that Pareto and constraint-based approaches could be used as part of a successful decision process; but a tradeoff-based approach, like multiattribute utility theory, is required to identify the true best system in all but a few special cases. We show that there is no guaranteed strategic equivalence between utility theory and constraint-based approaches when constraints on the means of the performance measures are used in the latter.

Yet, despite their increasing importance in military affairs and foreign policy, we know next to nothing about the individual men and women who serve their country as military contractors in PMSCs. To fill this gap, this chapter provides a data-driven analysis of the individual private contractors working for major PMSCs. We provide descriptive information on the private contractor population by analyzing employee profiles and job histories for those employed by PMSCs in the last decade. We investigate a unique database of professional resumes from a leading online job search and social networking website, which consists of employees randomly sampled from eight of the major PMSCs in the industry. The analysis describes the demographics, military experience and ranking, and education backgrounds of these employees. Moreover, we contextualize our findings with prior literature and demographics on the current US active duty military personnel, military veterans, and the general adult population.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=butlerjs,Who are the Private Military and Security Contractors?

Neural Information Processing Systems 2023 (Jan. 2024).",2024,Cascading Bandits: Optimizing Recommendation Frequency in Delayed Feedback Environments,"Delayed feedback is a critical problem in dynamic recommender systems. In practice, the feedback result often depends on the frequency of recommendation. Most existing online learning literature fails to consider optimization of the recommendation frequency, and regards the reward from each successfully recommended message to be equal. In this paper, we consider a novel cascading bandits setting, where individual messages from a selected list are sent to a user periodically. Whenever a user does not like a message, she may abandon the system with a probability positively correlated with the recommendation frequency. A learning agent needs to learn both the underlying message attraction probabilities and users' abandonment probabilities through the randomly delayed feedback. We first show a dynamic programming solution to finding the optimal message sequence in deterministic scenarios, in which the reward is allowed to vary with different messages. Then we propose a polynomial time UCB-based offline learning algorithm, and discuss its performance by characterizing its regret bound. For the online setting, we propose a learning algorithm which allows adaptive content for a given user. Numerical experiment on AmEx dataset confirms the effectiveness of our algorithms.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=jc92763,Cascading Bandits: Optimizing Recommendation Frequency in Delayed Feedback Environments,"Information, Risk, and Operations Management",Goal 4,0.01578360223120402,False,

To select the best combination, AlphaRob fuses robust optimization with a new notion of a portfolio’s regret that accounts for the training data’s size. Our analysis only needs mild assumptions on the distribution of asset returns. AlphaRob significantly outperforms competing methods on several simulated and real-world datasets, even after adjusting for transaction costs. AlphaRob is  better on average than the nearest competitor, and  better than the next-best combination portfolio method.

For ""low-rank"" latent variable models, the natural contender will be to estimate the latent variables using SVD and use them for non-parametric regression. While we show consistency of this method under less stringent sparsity conditions, our experimental results suggest that the simple local CN-VEC method either outperforms the global SVD-RBF method, or has comparable performance for low rank models.

Annals of Applied Statistics. 11, 4 (2017).",2017,Modeling Node Incentives in Directed Networks,"9Twitter is a popular medium for individuals to gather information and express opinions on topics of interest to them. By understanding who is interested in what topics, we can gauge the public mood, especially during periods of polarization such as elections. However, while the total volume of tweets may be huge, many people tweet rarely, and tweets are short and often noisy. Hence, directly inferring topics from tweets is both complicated and difficult to scale. Instead, the network structure of Twitter (who tweets at whom, who follows whom) can telegraph the interests of Twitter users. We propose the Producer-Consumer Model (PCM) to link latent topical interests of individuals to the directed structure of the network. A key component of PCM is the modeling of incentives of Twitter users. In particular, for a user to attract more followers and become popular, she must strive to be perceived as an expert on some topic.We use this to reduce the parameter space of PCM, greatly increasing its scalability. We apply PCM to track the evolution of Twitter topics during the Italian Elections of 2013, and also to interpret those topics using hashtags. A secondary application of PCM to a citation network of machine learning papers is also shown.

This large volume of user-generated content is the application's notable strength, but also makes the problem of finding the authoritative users for a given topic challenging. Discovering topical authorities can be useful for providing relevant recommendations to the users. In addition, it can aid in building a catalog of topics and top topical authorities in order to engage new users, and hence provide a solution to the cold-start problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach that we call the Authority Learning Framework (ALF) to find topical authorities in Instagram. ALF is based on the self-described interests of the follower base of popular accounts. We infer regular users' interests from their self-reported biographies that are publicly available and use Wikipedia pages to ground these interests as fine-grained, disambiguated concepts. We propose a generalized label propagation algorithm to propagate the interests over the follower graph to the popular accounts. We show that even if biography-based interests are sparse at an individual user level they provide strong signals to infer the topical authorities and let us obtain a high precision authority list per topic. Our experiments demonstrate that ALF performs significantly better at user recommendation task compared to fine-tuned and competitive methods, via controlled experiments, in-the-wild tests, and over an expert-curated list of topical authorities.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=dc38643,Discovery of Topical Authorities in Instagram,"Information, Risk, and Operations Management",Goal 4,0.003575804202809099,False,

Academy of Management Journal. 63, 4 (Aug. 2020), 1028-1053.",2020,Take a stand or keep your seat: Independent director exit after social activist challenges,"While prior work has shown that a firm’s market performance affects the loyalty of its board, little is known about how corporate social responsibility affects directors’ willingness to serve. In this project, we shed light on this question by exploring how social movement boycotts that challenge a firm’s social responsibility affect board turnover. We find that boycotts provoke a significant increase in turnover at targeted firms, and that directors are especially likely to leave after boycotts that signal that the firm’s social values conflict with their personal values. Specifically, we find that an ideological match between a board member and the activist challengers predicts exit: liberals are more likely to leave after liberal challenges and conservatives are more likely to leave after conservative challenges.

Yet, while many studies have examined how microfinance loans affect poor borrowers, we know little about how microfinance organizations (MFOs) themselves finance their lending activities. This is a significant oversight because most MFOs do not self-fund their lending, but, rather, rely on loans from external funders. To better understand microfinance funding, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective to analyze the lending practices of commercial and public funders, who together provide most of the capital for global microfinance. We argue that these funders adhere to financial and development logics, respectively, and that this leads them to invest in different types of MFOs. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, we suggest that the practices motivated by these logics will start to converge in ways that are problematic for a nation's microfinance sector. Using a proprietary database of all traceable loans to MFOs from 2004 to 2012, we find strong support for our hypotheses.

Methods: Our 677 patient cohort was derived from the 2013-2017 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program at a safety net hospital augmented with EHR data to determine insurance status and 30-day readmissions. Patients' home addresses were linked to the ADI and DCI.

Results: Our cohort consisted of 53.9% males and 63.8% Hispanics with a 22.9% 30-day readmission rate from the date of discharge; > 50% lived in highly deprived neighborhoods.

These studies are predominantly implemented via repeated independent, non-overlapping samples, which are much less costly than recruiting and maintaining a longitudinal panel that track the same sample over time. In the existing literature, data from repeated cross-sectional samples are analyzed either independently for each time period, or longitudinally by focusing on the dynamics of the aggregate measures (e.g., sample averages). In this study, we propose a multivariate state-space model that can be applied directly to the individual-level data from each of the independent samples, simultaneously taking advantage of three patterns embedded in the data: a) inter-temporal dependence within the population means of each variable, b) temporal co-movements across the population means of different variables and c) cross-sectional co-variation across individual responses within each sample. We illustrate our proposed model with two applications, demonstrating the benefits of making full use of all the available data. In the first illustration, we have access to all the individual-level purchase data from one large population of grocery shoppers over a span of 36 months. This provides us a testing ground for benchmarking our proposed model against existing approaches in a Monte Carlo experiment, where we show that our model outperforms all the alternatives in inferring population dynamics using data sampled through repeated cross-sections. We find that, as compared with using simple sample averages, our proposed model can improve the accuracy of repeated cross-sectional tracking studies by double digits, without incurring any additional data-gathering costs (or equivalently, reducing the data-gathering costs by double digits while maintaining the desired accuracy level).

The effects of pushes are positively correlated with shoppers’ propensities of app pulls and mall visits, which suggests that timing the delivery of pushes can make them more effective. Furthermore, location-based pushes exhibit stronger positive effects on app pulls and coupon outclicks during a shopping trip than behavior-based pushes, even after shoppers receive the latter before the trip, which shows that behavior and location-based pushes are not substitutable.

In this work, we use natural gas futures prices in a Kalman filter approach with maximum likelihood estimation to parameterize the Schwartz and Smith (2000) stochastic price model, and then apply an asset pricing model to address the large uncertainty of the risk premia parameter estimates. To evaluate the impact of the risk premia and other parameters in the two-factor price model on project valuation, we apply the price model to a prototypical shale gas investment, both for a base reference case as well as for cases where there are real options to optimally time decisions to invest or to abandon the project. Using this approach, we are able to determine the implied risk-adjusted discount rate that would be used with the spot price forecast, given the two-factor model risk premia, and we also discuss the impact of the risk premia on project value relative to other model parameters.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=dyerjs,Risk Premia in Commodity Price Forecasts and Their Impact on Valuation,"Information, Risk, and Operations Management",Goal 2,0.01423565144781782,False,

(2017).",2017,Sensitivity Analysis of Decision Making under Dependent Uncertainties using Copulas,"Many important decision and risk analysis problems are complicated by dependencies between input variables. In such cases, standard one-variable-at-a-time sensitivity analysis methods are typically eschewed in favor of fully probabilistic, or n-way, analysis techniques which simultaneously vary all n input variables and capture their interdependencies. Unfortunately, much of the intuition provided by one-way sensitivity analysis may not be available in fully probabilistic methods because it is difficult or impossible to isolate the marginal effects of the individual variables. In this paper, we present a dependence-adjusted approach for identifying and analyzing the impact of the input variables in a model through the use of probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on copulas. This approach provides insights about the influence of the input variables and the dependence relationships between the input variables. One contribution of this approach is that it facilitates assessment of the relative marginal influence of variables for the purpose of determining which variables should be modeled in applications where computational efficiency is a concern, such as in decision tree analysis of large-scale problems. In addition, we also investigate the sensitivity of a model to the magnitude of correlations in the inputs.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=dyerjs,Sensitivity Analysis of Decision Making under Dependent Uncertainties using Copulas,"Information, Risk, and Operations Management",Goal 9,0.004669548638445232,False,

Cesare Fracassi,"Fracassi, C. and Magnuson, W. 2021. Data Autonomy. Vanderbuilt Law Review. 74, (2021), 327.",2021,Data Autonomy,"In recent years, “data privacy” has vaulted to the forefront of public attention. Scholars, policymakers, and the media have, nearly in unison, decried the lack of data privacy in the modern world. In response, they have put forth various proposals to remedy the situation, from the imposition of fiduciary obligations on technology platforms to the creation of rights to be forgotten for individuals. All these proposals, however, share one essential assumption: we must raise greater protective barriers around data. As a scholar of corporate finance and a scholar of corporate law, respectively, we find this assumption problematic. Data, after all, is simply information, and information can be used for beneficial purposes as well as harmful ones. Just as it can be used to discriminate and to embarrass, information can be used to empower and to improve. And while data privacy is often pitched at ending unauthorized data sharing, it all too often leads simply to the end of data sharing, period. This comes at a cost. Data silos can inhibit consumer choice, protect the positions of powerful incumbents, and reduce the efficiency of markets. The best example of these costs comes from the financial industry. For more than a century, banks and other financial institutions have built their information technology systems to keep financial records as private and nonshareable as possible. While security concerns can be a primary reason for such closed systems, banks also understand that financial data is an advantage that can protect them from market entry and competition. Banks can hold up consumers with unfavorable rates and inferior products as a result, and a set of market failures make it difficult for consumers to opt out. First, information asymmetries between consumers and financial institutions are large and difficult to resolve. Second, search and switch costs—the difficulty of finding out more information about the risks and benefits of financial products and of switching to a better financial service—are high in the financial industry. Finally, individuals struggle to take advantage of even simple financial strategies to save, borrow, and invest. Data sharing can help resolve these problems. The emergence of a new regulatory and technological framework called “open banking” raises the possibility of consumers being able to task trusted intermediaries with automatically analyzing their financial data, nudging them to achieve their goals, and switching them to better products, all in order to reduce the substantial inefficiencies in their financial lives. There is one problem, however. A combination of market failure and regulatory ambiguity has led to a situation in which data is limited, siloed, and inaccessible, thereby preventing individuals from using their data in efficient ways. Ultimately, this Article contends, resolving these problems will require us to replace the clarion call of “data privacy” with a new, more comprehensive concept, that of “data autonomy”—the ability of individuals to have control over their data. Data autonomy balances the need for data to be protected and secure with the need for it to be accessible and shareable. In this Article, we lay out a set of key principles that grant individuals a legal right to data autonomy, including a right of ownership over data, as well as obligations on institutions to safely share standardized and interoperable data with third parties that consumers so choose. Perhaps counterintuitively, the only way of expanding consumer welfare and protection today is by breaking down the barriers of data privacy.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=cf8745,Data Autonomy,Finance,Goal 17,0.07253207049478876,True,data accountability; resource sharing

These weights are class-dependent, and are determined by the similarities of sample features under the least favorable scenarios. When the size of the uncertainty set is properly tuned, the robust classifier has a smaller Lipschitz norm than the vanilla k-NN, and thus improves the generalization capability.

The model used in this study expands the EPPM model to include social factors (parental and peer pressure) and a range of emotions beyond fear. After pre-testing the field study included 1479 non-smoking adolescents 11–13 years old and 358 smokers 11–13 years old from a mix of schools in southern England. All scales proved reliable and the data were submitted to SEM. Among non-smokers parental views of smoking have a strong effect on smoking attitude and intentions to smoke, as does susceptibility to peer pressure. Perceived threat of smoking results in attitudes toward smoking being more negative for social threats only, while perceived efficacy reduces both attitudes and intentions for both social and physical threats.

A main challenge identified by this research is that adolescents who smoke showed lower levels of perceived threat for smoking than do non-smokers. Literature shows that smokers who see a warning respond in a defensive manner and downplay the negative health effects of smoking. This lower perceived threat acts as a defence mechanism and is compatible with the notion of strong optimistic bias among adolescents. Perceived efficacy is an important factor in shaping future smoking attitudes and for intentions among both smokers and non-smoking adolescents. This study contributes to existing knowledge by showing how mechanisms of coping response can regulate reactions to physical and social threat appeals, physical (e.g., fear) and social (e.g., shame).

The research has implications for both theory and health promotions. The results enhance knowledge of the effectiveness of threats, particularly for the under-research adolescent segment who are potentially vulnerable to peer pressure and, at times, resistant to parental influence. It also has implications for the design of public health anti-smoking campaigns for adolescent targets.

E-cigarettes are growing health risk, potentially, among adolescents. The results are also a call for inquiry into adolescent responses to e-cigarette public health messages. As the use of e-cigarettes increases around the world, there is an urgent need to not only investigate the health implications of this tobacco product but also how successful health communications may and may not be strategically similar to those of traditional tobacco products, such as cigarettes.

Moreover, the personal nature of direct selling, being based on a strong person-to-person interactive process, enables a variety of research endeavors that use direct selling to provide a vehicle or venue for data collection and testing hypotheses. Indeed, more than 150 peer-reviewed articles have been published on direct selling topics or have used direct selling data in research.

Just as with business-to-business (B2B) marketing, government segments must solicit funds from other government agencies and distribute funds to other government agencies. Examples include state interactions with federal agencies (as clients) when requesting competitively distributed disaster funding from the federal government (e.g., for flood mitigation after a hurricane), the US Department of Transportation funding to State Departments of Transportation for highway construction, US Department of Housing and Urban Development funding to state and local governments for housing assistance, or federal government funding to state universities (grants from SBA, NSF, NIH, etc.). States also act as suppliers distributing funds to local governments for housing assistance, health and welfare systems, etc. When a catastrophe spreads across several states, states essentially compete to receive as much as possible of the federal funds pie. Just as with for-profit industries and social profit enterprises, governments are in competition for market share. We denote the process of facilitating this dual solicitation/distribution role involving governmental entity’s exchange is called “Government to Government Marketing” (G2G marketing for short).

This presentation addresses techniques useful for G2G marketing when competition among divisions of government is simultaneously competitive and cooperative with goals directed toward a very tangible social goal, such as disaster relief and recovery. Unlike B2B marketing, profit orientation is not a motive but competition for exchange ensues for other rationales (including votes and funding goals). G-to-G marketing stakes can be for billions of dollars and create large economic domino effects for the communities receiving funding. Many disciplines are relevant to G2G marketing as society and public policy makers are central stakeholders in this competition.

G2G marketing differs from B2B marketing approaches in that it often operates with more (unpublished/unknown) constraints on permissible competitive marketing techniques. And, disasters themselves create all kinds of markets, even in government relations. G2G marketing is an increasingly important and academically ignored approach to market perspectives, not previously introduced into the marketing literature. While at first glance these situations may appear “political,” there are clear marketing implications from relationship marketing to political (voter) marketing and market share analyses, as well as strategic market planning.

Some traditional marketing techniques that apply to the potentially high-stakes G2G marketing are discussed. For example, predictive modeling to estimate future needs before they occur, and relationship marketing between and among agencies being headed by elected officials.

Regardless of the desirability of rate regulation, it does happen. The objective of this paper is to explore how to develop better methods for setting regulated rates. This paper presents a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to determine efficient levels of expenses to use as an input into rate making by regulators when market competition determined levels of expenses are unavailable. Thus, we develop an efficiency-based rate promulgation methodology and use title insurance in Texas to illustrate this process.

We find support for our framework across three studies.

Although there is some evidence to support this notion, there is also evidence to suggest that status differences may amplify information sharing in diverse teams by offering status enhancement incentives to members who share unique knowledge. In this paper, we reconcile these different predictions by suggesting that the effects of status hierarchy on the relationship between knowledge diversity and team information sharing will depend on the stability of the hierarchy. Using a diverse sample of 156 teams across 110 organizations, we found that status differences constricted information sharing in knowledge-diverse teams when hierarchy stability was high and amplified information sharing in knowledge-diverse teams when hierarchy stability was low. These information sharing effects, in turn, affected team performance.

We propose that leader agreeableness stifles team leaders' effectiveness by moderating the efficacy of their constructive feedback to the team. We argue that feedback delivered by an agreeable individual will be higher in positive emotional tone, and that positive emotional tone is, itself, informational content from which recipient teams draw inferences about the need to adapt. As a result, we suggest that team leaders' agreeableness influences the effectiveness of the constructive feedback they provide. Using two studies, one panel study of working adults and another of sales teams, we find support for our theory. Specifically, we show that agreeable individuals provide feedback that has linguistic features that convey higher levels of positive emotional tone. We then show that constructive feedback from team leaders encourages team reflexivity, which in turn enhances team performance, but that high agreeableness inhibits the impact of leaders' constructive feedback. Constructive feedback provided by agreeable leaders limits team reflexivity in response to the feedback.

However, these findings are scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for organizational scholars to leverage this knowledge in the advancement of gender research. The purpose of this review is to assemble these findings to capture how gender and race, when considered in tandem, can generate new understandings about women of different racial groups and their experiences in the workplace. We first provide a review of both historic and contemporary interpretations of the intersectionality concept. Next, using an intersectional framework, we review key findings on the distinct stereotypes ascribed to Black, Asian, and White women, and compare and contrast the differential impact of these stereotypes on hiring and leadership for these subgroups of women. Building from these stereotypes, we further review research that explores the different job roles that Black, Asian, and White women occupy, specifically focusing on the impact of occupational segregation, organizational support, and the motherhood penalty. Finally, we examine how the frequency, emotional toll, and legal implications of sexual harassment can vary for women of differing races. Through this review, we bring attention to the pitfalls of studying women as a monolithic category and call for organizational scholars to consider the role of intersectionality in shaping workplace outcomes.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=dah2475,Intersectionality: Connecting experiences of gender with race at work,Management,Goal 5,0.2032257164913928,True,gender and technology; gender bias; gender discrimination; women in the workforce

There is an opinion that, over many years, the articles in JCR have trended toward the interests of academics and do not address the actual problems faced by consumers, firms, and public policy-makers (Inman et al. 2018). Also, there has been concern that much of what appears in JCR is narrow in scope, both in terms of theory and the empirical methods employed. Further, the dependent variables investigated are often lacking in real-world significance.

These concerns have led to calls to increase relevance in consumer research. For example, Wells (1993) argued that “any given piece of research should be designed from the start with a consideration of how it will be useful to audiences it seeks to address” (Dahl et al. 2014, iii). According to Dahl et al. (2014), a single mantra for JCR should be to “make it meaningful” to its audience. The audience includes academics from the founding fields as well as scholars in other fields, consumers, marketing managers, and public policy-makers. Nevertheless, despite these calls, JCR was recently rated the lowest of the premier academic marketing journals on one measure of practical relevance (Jedidi et al. 2021).",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=hoyerwd,Practical Relevance in Consumer Research,Marketing,Goal 9,0.008237956618030274,False,

Considering this, the current study provides an exploratory investigation into a new way to build up customer resilience that would otherwise not be formed simply by strengthening positive attributes of the customer-brand relationship. It argues that brands can strengthen their customers’ immunity to negative brand-related information by using an immunity metric (i.e., merely asking customers to reflect on their immunity makes them more resilient to actual negative information in the future). The construct of immunity has the dual benefit of being diagnostic of relationship strength, as well as acting as an immunizing agent.

Therefore, in the context of a consumer-based strategy, this study investigates whether life events change actual purchase behavior as well as how three important and managerially actionable consumer difference variables (consumer innovativeness, the variety seeking tendency, and price consciousness) mediate this link. Purchase records of an individual-level consumer panel, combined with demographic and survey data over a three-year period, indicate that there is a direct link between life events and changes in share of wallet (SOW) and share of units (SOU) for the preferred brand in a product category. Further, experiencing a life event leads to an increase in consumer innovativeness that, in turn, decreases SOW/SOU for the preferred brand for some purchases, while at the same time leading to a decrease in consumers’ variety seeking tendency and price consciousness for others that, in turn, lead to an increase in SOW/SOU. These findings suggest a paradox of change that can both enhance and inhibit purchasing new brands. Finally, the effects of first-time life events (i.e., significant markers in the course of life that occur for the first time) are stronger than the effects of repeated life events, and life events with a positive economic impact have a strong negative effect on change in price consciousness.

An implicit association test and two consumption studies provide evidence that people hold an implicit belief that healthy foods are less filling than unhealthy foods, an effect we label the “healthy = less filling” intuition. The consumption studies provide evidence that people order greater quantities of food, consume more of it, and are less full after consuming a food portrayed as more versus less healthy. In addition, we demonstrate a novel tactic for reversing consumers’ intuitions: highlighting the nourishing aspects of healthy food mitigates the belief that it is less filling. Taken together, these findings add to the burgeoning body of work on the psychological causes of weight gain and obesity and point to a way of overturning the pernicious effects of the “healthy = less filling” intuition.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=hoyerwd,Eating Healthy or Feeling Empty?

Our empirical results, based on data drawn from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), show that complementors are more likely to obtain high-impact innovations in technological fields that have more standards. More importantly, this effect varies based on the downstream capabilities of developers of enabling technologies and the downstream capabilities of complementors. The standards created by vertically integrated developers have a stronger effect on facilitating high-impact innovations by complementors than the standards created by specialist developers.

In this paper, we outline a framework for establishing such a suite of indicators based on system science and life cycle assessment. We identify a number of considerations that should be addressed including the following: (a) scope, ranging from project level (for example, a thermoelectric power plant) through higher system network levels (industry to national to global-level analysis), and (b) the category of the metric, which is defined by two dimensions, (i) intrinsic vs. extrinsic and (ii) absolute vs. relative units, whether the metric indicates an absolute value (for example m3 of freshwater consumption or kWh of electricity used by a power plant) or a value relative to an industry/policy performance benchmark or some environmental indicator (e.g., available water within the basin in which our power plant is located). By understanding the scope and category of metrics derived from economic, life cycle, or other modeling and accounting methods, we understand how various stakeholders are motivated to focus on certain metrics over others.

Biophysical Economics and Resource Quality. 1, 2 (2016).",2016,Information Theory to Assess Relations Between Energy and Structure of the U,"This paper describes the changing structure of the United States’ (U.S.) domestic economy by applying information theory-based metrics to the U.S. input–output (I–O) tables from 1947 to 2012. Here the I–O tables are an economic network where the sectors are the nodes. The value of these metrics is that they describe the balance or trade-off between efficiency and redundancy of network flows as well as equality and hierarchy of flows through nodes in a network. I relate these metrics to the U.S. gross power consumption and annual intermediate spending by the food and energy sectors, the latter being a proxy for the inverse of the net power ratio (or net energy) of the economy, to test hypotheses of energy–economy structural linkages. The results of this paper show that increasing gross power consumption, as well as a decreasing share of intermediate expenditures of the food and energy sectors, correlates with increased distribution of money among economic sectors, and vice versa. The information theory metrics indicate two time periods at which major structural shifts occurred. The first was between 1967 and 1972, and the second was around the turn of the twenty-first century when food and energy expenditures no longer continued to decrease after 2002. In response to the latter, it is clear that the U.S. economy did trade off structural reserves (e.g., decreasing metrics of conditional entropy, redundancy, and equality) for structural efficiency (e.g., increasing metrics of efficiency, mutual constraint, and hierarchy) after food and energy expenditures increased post-2002. I also test the structural trends with increasingly simpler (e.g., fewer sectors) representations of the I–O tables, and the results are more consistent for I–O representations that account for inputs and outputs (e.g., value added and gross domestic product) rather than only the intermediate transactions among sectors. The findings of this paper have important implications for economic modeling in at least two ways. First, the paper helps explain how fundamental shifts in resources costs relate to economic structure and economic growth. Second, the paper shows that the number of sectors used to represent economic transactions influences the systemic metrics themselves.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=cwk,Information Theory to Assess Relations Between Energy and Structure of the U,"Business, Government, and Society",Goal 7,0.15770942978813,True,electricity consumption; energy demand; energy efficiency; global energy consumption

Our results reveal that investors are misled by partial management explanations. We demonstrate that this effect occurs in situation both when qualitative information is known about the causes and when quantitative information is known about the causes. We document that one way in which this overreliance on management-provided partial information can be mitigated is when investors are provided with a quantitative analysis of the management explanation; with this quantitative analysis we observe that investors are able to distinguish between partial and complete explanations.

Based on a survey of 145 firms, empirical evidence suggests that the level of risk governance in a firm is related to the size of the firm, leverage and dividend payments and the chief executive officer’s influence on the board; this may suggest that corporate governance motives, like the need for governance, existing governance and the control a CEO has over governance decisions, determine the decision to take the step toward implementing ERM. This study is a step toward clarifying the existing ad hoc theoretical foundations of ERM and implies that firms are implementing ERM in accordance with stakeholder desires for better governance of the risk management system.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=sal3928,Why firms implement risk governance-Stepping beyond traditional risk management to enterprise risk management,Finance,Goal 16,0.03763376760417605,False,

To address these questions, we develop a multivariate event history model to evaluate the effects of behavior and location-based push promotions on shoppers’ app usage and offline shopping activities. Our study generates new insights into mobile app promotions and offline shopping. We find that behavior-based pushes have a higher impact on consumer responses before a shopping trip than during a trip, and their effects vary significantly across different types of retailers. The effects of pushes are positively correlated with shoppers’ propensities of app pulls and mall visits, which suggests that timing the delivery of pushes can make them more effective. Furthermore, location-based pushes exhibit stronger positive effects on app pulls and coupon outclicks during a shopping trip than behavior-based pushes, even after shoppers receive the latter before the trip, which shows that behavior and location-based pushes are not substitutable. We demonstrate through simulations that our model enables marketers to design more effective mobile targeting strategies by exploiting heterogeneous consumer responses. Addressing potential endogeneity by controlling for the information used for customer selection in the customer’s response functions, our proposed model can be applied to many empirical problems involving event history data.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=mahajanv,Push and Pull: Modeling Mobile App Promotions and Consumer Responses,Marketing,Goal 9,0.009793323274500306,False,

They face difficulty in retaining active donors, reactivating lapsed donors, and acquiring prospective donors. The challenge often stems from the need for more reliable data for predicting the expected behavior of different groups of donors. Although nonprofits have reliable data relating to past donations from active donors, the data on lapsed donors is limited, and data on prospective donors is nonexistent. We propose that nonprofits can use community-clustered donor profiles to predict the expected donations. Our results validate that predictions based on “actual donation data” and “community donor profiles” are equivalent in accuracy. Drawing insights from the nonprofit marketing and social psychology literature, we suggest that nonprofits can reliably devise targeting strategies for active, lapsed, and prospective donors using community-clustered profiles.

The literature has focused on three static bundling strategies under which the products are sold separately (pure components or PC) or only in a bundled form (pure bundling or PB) or both (mixed bundling or MB). In a generalization, and motivated by real world examples, this paper examines the relative effectiveness of temporal bundling. We consider a firm that sells to a market of myopic and strategic consumers, and a selling season consisting of two stages. We compare four strategies – PC-PC (i.e., pure components in each of two stages), PB-PB, PB-PC and PC-PB – relative to MB. Our results show that PB-PB maximizes profits under low marginal costs; PC-PC prevails under high marginal costs given a large proportion of myopic consumers; and PB-PC is profit maximizing under moderate marginal costs when most consumers are strategic. These temporal strategies dominate MB except when the market is comprised entirely of strategic consumers. Finally, while temporal mixed bundling – MB-MB – is weakly superior to other temporal strategies, the latter are much easier to implement, as shown by real-world uses, and suffice to capture most of the profits. Related interesting pricing implications are discussed. Three extensions to the main model are also proposed.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=mahajanv,Temporal Product Bundling with Myopic and Strategic Consumers: Manifestations and Relative Effectiveness,Marketing,Goal 17,0.008911743622256954,False,

The authors propose that CEOs’ degree of political liberalism positively affects their firms’ rate of NPIs. This impact is weakened, however, when CEOs have low power, when a high proportion of their compensation comes from equity, when the marketing department has high influence in the top management team, and when the economy is growing. Liberal CEOs’ greater rate of NPIs is associated with superior Tobin's q but also higher stock return volatility. Findings based on observations of 421 publicly listed U.S. firms from 2006 to 2010 provide considerable support for the authors’ hypotheses. The authors also examine changes in firms’ rate of NPIs and performance around CEO turnovers and find corroborating evidence for their thesis.

Coupled with other results related to industry sales growth and stability that make CMO turnover less likely, these findings underscore marketing’s demand- or customer-facing role in the firm. The authors also show that some of these results are distinct to turnover among CMOs compared to other top management team (TMT) executives. While this research does show support for extant theory, its focus on the CMO within the TMT results in important contributions to the turnover literature. These include the inverted-U effect of TMT marketing experience on CMO turnover and the nuanced attenuation by CMO insider-ness of a similar relationship between CMO tenure and turnover. Overall, the results lead to important practical implications for managing CMO turnover.",,,,https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/profile/?username=mahajanv,Shedding Light on the CMO Revolving Door: A Study of the Antecedents of Chief Marketing Offer Turnover,Marketing,Goal 1,0.01324539763771638,False,

We test our theory using a within-subject policy-capturing experimental design that simulates organizational DM approaches, supplemented with census data for the participants' home communities. Results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses suggest that the manipulated instrumental value for diversity leads to higher perceptions of organizational attractiveness, in part through heightened expectations of merit-based hiring decisions.
