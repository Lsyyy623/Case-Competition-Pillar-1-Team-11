Why Do People Choose Extreme Candidates? The Role of Identity Relevance,"Mohamed Hussein, Zakary Tormala, S. Christian Wheeler",Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,2026,"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology January2026 Vol. 122, Article 104821",https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/why-do-people-choose-extreme-candidates-role-identity-relevance,"Elected officials are increasingly extreme. Research trying to understand this trend has tended to focus on structural factors, such as primary elections and changes in the supply of candidates. Less emphasis has been placed on psychological perspectives. The current research advances such a perspective. Leveraging research on attitudes, we investigate when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their own party. We posit that the identity relevance of people’s attitudes plays a key role. Specifically, we propose that identity relevance fosters attitude extremity, which in turn promotes a preference for extreme over moderate candidates. Across six main studies (N = 3136) using a variety of political issues, operationalizations of identity relevance, instantiations of candidate extremity, and experimental paradigms (including two studies with human-LLM interactions), we find support for this hypothesis. Our findings suggest that as attitudes become more identity relevant, they become more extreme, leading individuals to prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their party. These results shed light on when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates, contribute to a nascent literature on the identity relevance of people’s attitudes, and advance our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of attitude extremity.",,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01126273448117866,False,
Fifteen Reasons You Should Read This Paper: How Providing Many Arguments Increases Perceptions of Both Expertise and Persuasive Intent,"Abigail Bergman, Mohamed Hussein, Rhia Catapano, Zakary Tormala",Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,2026,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 2026 Issue in press,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/fifteen-reasons-you-should-read-paper-how-providing-many-arguments,"People generally believe more is better in persuasion, for good reason. Past research has shown that providing more arguments can enhance a message’s persuasiveness. In contrast, we demonstrate that increasing the number of arguments in a message can have conflicting effects on perceptions of the message source. Compared to using few arguments, using many arguments makes the source seem like more of an expert, increasing persuasion, but it can also make the source seem like they have more persuasive intent, decreasing persuasion. These perceptions suppress each other, creating minimal or no overall benefit to persuasion. We document these effects across multiple experiments. We further demonstrate that providing many arguments can have a clear positive or negative effect, depending on whether high expertise or low persuasive intent is more valued. These findings expand our understanding of argument quantity effects in persuasion and contribute to a growing literature on conflicting source perceptions.",,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.002266436457459865,False,
Talking About What We Support Versus Oppose Affects Others’ Openness To Our Views,"Rhia Catapano, Zakary Tormala",Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2026,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 2026,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/talking-about-what-we-support-versus-oppose-affects-others-openness,"People’s unwillingness to engage with others who hold views that differ from their own—in other words, their lack of receptiveness to opposing views—is a growing problem globally. We explore the possibility that something as simple as how people frame their position can shape disagreeing others’ receptiveness to them. Specifically, we investigate the role of support-oppose framing—that is, whether people frame their position in terms of what they support or what they oppose. In five main studies spanning 5,921 participants, we find a disparity in how communicators and disagreeing others perceive support- versus oppose-framed messages. Communicators believe that disagreeing others will be more receptive to them if they use support rather than oppose framing. One contributor to this effect is value congruence: Communicators perceive a message articulating their own position in support terms to be more value congruent. However, disagreeing others are actually less receptive to support-framed messages than to oppose-framed messages. We find that disagreeing others perceive support framing as less congruent with their values, which predicts decreased receptiveness. This effect manifests in self-reported receptiveness and a variety of downstream consequences and predicts greater attitude change following oppose- rather than support-framed messages. Thus, by framing their positions in terms of what they oppose (rather than support), people can elicit greater receptiveness from disagreeing others. Consistent with a value-congruence account, this framing effect fully reverses for people with the same values as the communicator.",,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01010648114586843,False,
Veto Players and Policy Development,"Alexander V.

If veto players are moderate, there is active competition between developers on both sides of the ideological spectrum. However, more extreme veto players induce asymmetric activity, as one side disengages from development. With highly-extreme veto players, policy development ceases and gridlock results. We also analyze effects on centrists’ utility. Moderate veto players dampen productive policy development and extreme ones eliminate it entirely, either of which is bad for centrists. But some effects are surprisingly positive; somewhat-extreme veto players can induce policy developers who dislike the status quo to craft moderate, high-quality proposals. Our model accounts for changing patterns of policymaking in the U.S. Senate, and suggests that if polarization continues centrists will become increasingly inclined to eliminate the filibuster.",,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.02966613142106871,False,policy coherence
Putting Climate into Context: How Culture and Composition Shape the Effects of Diversity Climate,"Alison V. Hall, Derek R. Avery, Michele J. Gelfand, Patrick F.

Though some scholars theorize potential mediators to explain these effects, recent meta-analytic and literature reviews conclude that much remains unknown regarding both why diversity climate influences outcomes and how sociocultural factors within and beyond the organization may shape its implications. We propose that unit-level diversity climate stands to produce more uniformly positive affective commitment levels (i.e., higher commitment mean and lower commitment dispersion), thereby optimizing the returns on human capital investments in the form of greater unit productivity. Data from 738 stores in 48 American states indicate a significant indirect effect of unit diversity climate on productivity through affective commitment mean and dispersion. Moreover, we apply the concept of climate context congruence to extend diversity climate theory and explore the influence of alignment among unit-level diversity climate, unit composition (i.e., racioethnic diversity), and cultural tightness–looseness (i.e., state tightness–looseness) in the geographic region within which the unit is operating. In doing so, we offer a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of the sociocultural conditions wherein supportive diversity climates may be differentially beneficial. Our results support the notion that organizations may reap greater benefits of diversity climate when state culture and unit composition align (i.e., tighter/homogenous, or looser/diverse) to accentuate diversity climate efficacy.",,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.2248282655962106,True,climate adaptation
Bond Convenience Yields in the Eurozone Currency Union,"Zhengyang Jiang, Hanno Lustig, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, Mindy Z.

The intertemporal government budget constraint requires member countries’ bond convenience yields and default spreads to adjust in response to shocks to their government surpluses. In the data, adjustments to convenience yields explain a larger fraction of the variation in Eurozone bond yields than default spreads. Higher convenience yields are correlated with stronger fiscal conditions both in the cross-section and in the time series. These findings imply large fiscal costs especially on the peripheral countries. If all Eurozone countries could have issued sovereign bonds at the same convenience yields as Germany, they would have raised an extra 281 billion euros in cumulative revenues from bond issuance between 2003 and 2020, representing 2.6% of 2020 Eurozone GDP.",,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01823998021881761,False,fiscal capacity
Comparing Experimental and Nonexperimental Methods: What Lessons Have We Learned Four Decades after LaLonde (1986)?,"Guido W.

He concluded that the nonexperimental methods at the time could not systematically replicate experimental benchmarks, casting doubt on their credibility. Following LaLonde’s critical assessment, there have been significant methodological advances and practical changes, including (1) an emphasis on the unconfoundedness assumption separated from functional form considerations, (2) a focus on the importance of overlap in covariate distributions, (3) the introduction of propensity score-based methods leading to doubly robust estimators, (4) methods for estimating and exploiting treatment effect heterogeneity, and (5) a greater emphasis on validation exercises to bolster research credibility. To demonstrate the practical lessons from these advances, we reexamine the LaLonde data. We show that modern methods, when applied in contexts with sufficient covariate overlap, yield robust estimates for the adjusted differences between the treatment and control groups. However, this does not imply that these estimates are causally interpretable. To assess their credibility, validation exercises (such as placebo tests) are essential, whereas goodness-of-fit tests alone are inadequate. Our findings highlight the importance of closely examining the assignment process, carefully inspecting overlap, and conducting validation exercises when analyzing causal effects with nonexperimental data.",,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.005584911582236218,False,

Using a change in Australia’s income-contingent repayment schedule, I show that borrowers reduce their labor supply to lower their repayments. These responses are larger among borrowers with more hourly flexibility, a lower probability of repayment, and tighter liquidity constraints. I use these responses to estimate a dynamic model of labor supply with frictions that generate imperfect adjustment. My estimates imply that the labor supply responses to income-contingent repayment limit the optimal amount of insurance in government-provided student loans. However, these responses are too small to justify fixed-repayment contracts: restructuring existing student loans from fixed repayment to a constrained-optimal income-contingent loan—while keeping the tax and transfer system unchanged—increases borrower welfare by the equivalent of a 0.8% increase in lifetime consumption at no additional fiscal cost.",,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01824004700038259,False,

This framework highlights four dimensions along which accounting scholars contribute to the literature: (i) documenting the role of financial reporting incentives as a moderating factor in firms’ real responses, (ii) studying firms’ reporting versus real responses, (iii) quantifying real effects of tax disclosure regulations, and (iv) improving measurement of firms’ tax status and proxies for investment and employment. We identify open questions for future research and suggest new international, federal, and local settings that may help uncover underlying mechanisms driving observed economic phenomena.

This study combines close reading with large language models to analyze 80,000 reviews of 28,000 accepted and rejected manuscripts in engineering and the life sciences. By following reviewers’ value judgments and editorial decisions, we come to a different view of how epistemic cultures are practiced in journal science. Instead of a consensual dialogue revealing salient norms, we find reviewers differently weigh (“commensurate”) their judgments to attribute value to works. Their pluralistic viewpoints elevate uncertainty about the work, and editors respond by aligning with the most negative of reviewers. Surprisingly, we observe engineers and life scientists find the same epistemic criteria are salient, valued, and influential, with novelty and accuracy being primary.

We address this problem by combining several short-term outcomes (e.g., short-run earnings) into a “surrogate index,” the predicted value of the long-term outcome given the short-term outcomes. We show that the average treatment effect on the surrogate index equals the treatment effect on the long-term outcome under the assumption that the long-term outcome is independent of the treatment conditional on the surrogate index. We then characterize the bias that arises from violations of this assumption, deriving feasible bounds on the degree of bias and providing simple methods to validate the key assumption using additional outcomes. Finally, we develop efficient estimators for the surrogate index and show that even in settings where the long-term outcome is observed, using a surrogate index can increase precision.

Innovation readiness is crucial for transformative changes and enhanced performance in health care and depends on multiple factors including trust, training, and unit dynamics.

Purposes

We develop and validate a survey measuring innovation readiness in health care organizations, focusing on dispositional, situational, and learned dimensions. We identify individual and unit factors that constitute innovation readiness.

Methodology/Approach

We administered a survey assessing individual (e.g., autonomy at work) and unit (e.g., unit innovation climate) characteristics to 593 intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians across four ICUs (50.3% response). We used principal component analysis with varimax rotation to assess psychometrics and t tests to examine groups’ differences.

Results

Psychometric analysis detected seven factors; five multi-item factors, namely, trust in technology, concerns about technology, unit innovation climate, unit manager commitment to technology, and professional identity assessing innovation readiness; four factors with Cronbach’s alpha values ranging from 0.79 to 0.90; and two individual single-item factors measuring unit human–technology interdependence and unit training on technology. Individual and unit factors related to technology innovation readiness differed by professional discipline, unit, and tenure.

Conclusion

The survey exhibited reliability in four ICUs in one hospital, suggesting that this 21-item tool can be used in similar settings. Variation in innovation readiness among professional disciplines and units highlights the importance of tailored approaches when introducing new technologies.

Practice Implications

Managers can use this survey to gauge readiness and address individual and unit needs before implementing new technologies. Future research should validate this tool in diverse health care contexts to expand the literature on technology innovation readiness.",1.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.0448959202734598,False,innovation

First, I establish that unbiasedness as a requirement on the estimation of the average treatment effect can align researchers’ preferences with the minimization of the mean‐squared error relative to the truth, and that fixing the bias can yield an optimal restriction in a minimax sense.

We examine racial disparities in the discretionary context of traffic stops, their disparate influence on community members’ impressions, and the power of departmental guidance to close them.

Prior research focuses on how agility can equip such companies with strong sense-and-respond capabilities to identify and fulfill unpredictable customer demands.

These companies, relying on end-to-end digital technologies, have pushed this dimension of agility to unprecedentedly high levels, launching new products with great frequency and variety. The frequent product launches create freshness, stimulating latent demands of consumers and making these companies “ultra-fresh” fashion, a term we adopt in this paper. We seek to model this dimension of agility as an operational strategy for demand creation. Our model enables us to explore the effects through the lens of profit to the firm, consumer surplus, and environmental impact. Our analysis reveals that frequent product launches, high variety, and low prices—the three salient features of ultra-fresh fashion—are driven by both the product design agility and the customers’ interest for product freshness.

Feasibility of a Digital Coaching Program for Improving Mental Well-Being and Emotional Intelligence: Pragmatic Retrospective Cohort Study,"Nicholas Chalmer Peiper, Adam Pettitt, Bela Shah, Oliver Attwood, Ella Sivonen, Jeffrey Pfeffer",JMIR Formative Research,2025,JMIR Formative Research August72025 Vol. 9,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/feasibility-digital-coaching-program-improving-mental-well-being,"Background: Within the past decade, digital coaching programs (DCPs) have emerged as an evidence-based modality to improve mental well-being and emotional intelligence (EI), although there is limited evidence in real-world contexts.

Objective: This pragmatic retrospective cohort study aims to determine the preliminary effectiveness of a DCP in improving mental well-being and EI within a real-world context. We hypothesized that there would be a significant increase in mental well-being and EI.

Methods: This study included 588 people who voluntarily enrolled in an 8-week, blended care DCP offered through their employers from October 2021 to August 2024. The DCP included routine check-ins and consultations with certified coaches. Participants completed the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) at baseline and then weekly until the end of the program, as well as the Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale-10 (BEIS-10) at baseline and the end of the program. Multivariable linear mixed models examined changes in WHO-5 (biweekly) and BEIS-10 (pre-post) scores, adjusting for age, gender, program engagement, and program completion. Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated correlates of clinically meaningful improvements on the WHO-5 (ie, at least a 10-point improvement). We calculated a reliable change index (RCI) for the BEIS-10 and the proportion of participants meeting the RCI criterion from baseline to end of treatment.

Results: In multivariate linear mixed models adjusting for demographics and program characteristics, we observed a significant increase in WHO-5 scores (baseline x¯=45.6; week 8 x¯=66.3; Cohen’s d=1.98; P<.001). Over half of the sample (55.4%) experienced a clinically meaningful improvement on the WHO-5. Multivariable logistic regression found that higher engagement was associated with an increased odds of a clinically meaningful improvement on the WHO-5 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.002, 95% CI 1.001‐1.003), while program noncompletion (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.15‐0.50) and higher baseline well-being (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.89‐0.92) were associated with reduced odds. BEIS-10 scores also significantly increased from baseline to the end of the program after adjusting for relevant correlates (baseline x¯=37.6; week 8 x¯=41.2; Cohen’s d=1.32; P<.001). The estimated RCI on the BEIS-10 was approximately 5, with 19.7% experiencing a meaningful improvement.

Conclusions: These results demonstrate that DCPs can be a viable option for individuals looking to improve their mental well-being. Additional efforts should focus on establishing reliable change metrics for EI measures.

When Mimicry Leads to Divergence: Interdependence Asymmetries and Selective Imitation Among Competitors,"Sarah Balachandran, Julien Clement",Strategic Management Journal,2025,Strategic Management Journal August52025,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/when-mimicry-leads-divergence-interdependence-asymmetries-selective,"Research Summary

We investigate why firms imitating the same competitor’s strategy in the same environment often replicate different components of that strategy. We argue that such divergence can arise because firms vary in the internal interdependencies that underlie their strategies. When a firm significantly differs from a competitor in how one component of its strategy interacts with other components, the consequences of replicating the competitor’s choices about that component are harder to anticipate, making imitation less likely. We discuss how imitators’ internal coordination mechanisms may help mitigate barriers to imitation arising from interdependence asymmetries and test our resulting hypotheses in the context of esports, where small teams of professional video-game players compete in high-stakes tournaments.

Managerial Summary

We investigate why firms observing the same competitor often imitate different aspects of that competitor’s strategy. We argue that this variation stems from each firm’s unique internal connections between activities. When a competitor’s practice is closely linked to other parts of their strategy, imitation becomes riskier if similar links do not exist in the focal firm—making imitation less likely. Using data from esports teams, where both strategic choices and coordination are observable, we show that these differences can act as barriers to imitation. However, strong communication or shared experience among decision-makers helps overcome such barriers. Our results may caution managers against indiscriminately copying “best practices”: the highly competitive teams we studied considered not only what competitors did, but also whether those practices fit their own processes and structures.",1.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.006625657467288182,False,industrial diversification

Because information that is easy to access is more likely to be adopted, leaders often minimize friction in information delivery. However, one type of friction may increase engagement: piquing curiosity by posing relevant questions prior to sharing information. To test this, we shared identical information about COVID-19 in either question-and-answer format or via direct statements across two preregistered field experiments in Ghana and Michigan (total n = 49,395). Q&A-style communication increased information seeking about directly related topics (e.g., how to wear a mask properly) by 1.0 percentage point (216%) in Ghana and by 1.1 percentage points (19%) in Michigan (p’s < 0.001) and increased self-reported behavior change by 1.3 percentage points (4%) in Michigan (p = 0.002). However, sharing information in Q&A format did not increase interest in general COVID-19 information in either setting, suggesting that the impact of Q&A-style messaging on information seeking may be issue specific. In Michigan, both Q&A-style and direct statement messaging produced less information seeking than sending no informational messages, likely because of differential attrition: the more texts participants received, the more likely they were to opt out of receiving messages, which made it impossible for them to seek more information via text. In a follow-up implementation experiment with social media ads (a messaging strategy without attrition challenges), Q&A-style ads generated 9%–11% more unique clicks to the CDC website per dollar spent than ads that directly stated information about vaccines (p < 0.001).

Within our academic hospitalist division, the establishment of a Director of Community Partnership role in 2024 marked a significant step in recognizing and addressing the SDOH needs of hospitalized patients. Collaborative efforts with local Medicaid plans, county systems, and private non-profit organizations have facilitated improved care transitions, specialty care access, and support services.

To do so, we exploit the Patent Pilot Program (PPP) introduced by the U.S. Congress in 2011, which allowed judges with expertise and resources (as opposed to randomly selected judges) to preside over more patent cases to facilitate efficient ruling. We find firms headquartered in counties subject to the PPP increase patent-based innovation by 6.9%, relative to firms in counties not under the program. The increase is driven both by greater investments in R&D as well as firms strategically transitioning their trade secrets to patents. Moreover, patents filed after the PPP exhibit higher patent disclosure quality, consistent with the PPP providing a reliable enforcement mechanism that curbs competitors from illegally exploiting patent information. Our results are concentrated among firms with high legal costs and uncertainty: firms that engage in innovation with “fuzzy boundaries”, that have high litigation risk, and that are small and private. Probing further, we find that small private firms are significantly better at safeguarding their intellectual property (IP) using the judicial system, which in turn, helps them attract more venture capital investments after the PPP.

Individuals who sought beauty in food consistently selected healthier options across diverse consumption contexts—including cafeteria meals, self-generated food ideas, grocery lists, and varied menus (with and without images)—and across populations, spanning both adults and children. Notably, the effect was stronger among individuals who more strongly associate beauty with health and weaker in choice sets in which  the beauty–health association was less pronounced (e.g., morning cereals).

Recent work finds that colorblind individuals robustly understand and reason abstractly about color, implying that color associations in everyday language might contribute to the metaphorical understanding of color. However, it is unclear how much colorblind individuals’ understanding of color is driven by language versus their limited (but no less embodied) visual experience. A more direct test of whether language supports the acquisition of humans’ understanding of color is whether large language models (LLMs)—those trained purely on text with no visual experience—can nevertheless learn to generate consistent and coherent metaphorical responses about color. Here, we conduct preregistered surveys that compare colorseeing adults, colorblind adults, and LLMs in how they (1) associate colors to words that lack established color associations and (2) interpret conventional and novel color metaphors. Colorblind and colorseeing adults exhibited highly similar and replicable color associations with novel words and abstract concepts. Yet, while GPT (a popular LLM) also generated replicable color associations with impressive consistency, its associations departed considerably from colorseeing and colorblind participants. Moreover, GPT frequently failed to generate coherent responses about its own metaphorical color associations when asked to invert its color associations or explain novel color metaphors in context. Consistent with this view, painters who regularly work with color pigments were more likely than all other groups to understand novel color metaphors using embodied reasoning. Thus, embodied experience may play an important role in metaphorical reasoning about color and the generation of conceptual connections between embodied associations.",2.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.001885935396271114,False,

It tracks the customer’s or user’s interactions with products and services during experiences and maps out significant changes in those experiences. While CJM has been praised for its ability to understand customer experiences from their perspectives (i.e., empathy building), it suffers from limitations such as limited sample sizes and cognitive biases, mostly due to its reliance on traditional ethnographic methods such as interviews, observations, and surveys. To address these issues, this article presents an approach to performing CJM with mobile applications (apps) and quantitatively analyzing the gathered data. By dividing CJM into data collection and analytics stages, challenges in each stage are tackled separately. In the data collection stage, a custom-built mobile app is designed to gather information on customer experiences. Then, a two-step data analysis approach is developed to gain insights into those experiences. To demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness in tracking customer experiences, it was applied to the errand experiences of students during the pandemic, and the results were compared with those from a parallel study using traditional CJM approaches. The findings demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach in performing CJM and showed that additional insights can be obtained through the proposed approach.

Traditional RL models, however, often adopt a linear approach to updating reward expectations, potentially oversimplifying the nuanced relationship between human behavior and rewards. To address these challenges and explore models of RL, we utilized a method of model discovery using equation discovery algorithms. This method, currently used mainly in physics and biology, attempts to capture data by proposing a differential equation from an array of suggested linear and nonlinear functions. Using this method, we were able to identify a model of RL which we termed the Quadratic Q-Weighted model. The model suggests that reward prediction errors obey nonlinear dynamics and exhibit negativity biases, resulting in an underweighting of reward when expectations are low, and an overweighting of the absence of reward when expectations are high. We tested the generalizability of our model by comparing it to classical models used in nine published studies. Our model surpassed traditional models in predictive accuracy across eight out of these nine published datasets, demonstrating not only its generalizability but also its potential to offer insights into the complexities of human learning. This work showcases the integration of a behavioral task with advanced computational methodologies as a potent strategy for uncovering the intricate patterns of human cognition, marking a significant step forward in the development of computational models that are both interpretable and broadly applicable.",2.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.01318747174693688,False,

Contrary to the evidence in past studies, the affirmation effect was stronger among students who initially reported facing fewer stereotype threats.

This framework has animated research on psychological phenomena ranging from habit formation to social learning, moral decision-making, and cognitive development. Here, we propose that model-based and model-free algorithms may not be as aligned with deliberate and automatic evaluative processing as prevailing theories suggest. Across three preregistered behavioral experiments involving adult human participants (total n= 2,572), we show that model-based algorithms shape not only deliberate but also automatic evaluations. Experiment 1 numerically replicates past findings suggesting that deliberate (but not automatic) evaluative responses are uniquely shaped by model-based algorithms but, critically, also reveals confounds that render interpretation of this evidence equivocal. Experiments 2 to 3 eliminate these confounds and reveal robust model-based contributions to automatic evaluative processing across two measures of automatic evaluation, supported by multinomial processing tree modeling. Together, these results suggest that dominant frameworks may considerably underestimate both the ubiquity of model-based algorithms and the computational sophistication of automatic evaluative processing.",3.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.0116192804449386,False,
Load Balancing Using Sparse Communication,"Gal Mendelson, Kuang Xu",Operations Research,2025,Operations Research June192025,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/load-balancing-using-sparse-communication,"Load balancing across parallel servers is an important class of congestion control problems that arise in service systems. An effective load balancer relies heavily on accurate, real-time congestion information to make routing decisions. However, obtaining such information can impose significant communication overheads, especially in demanding applications such as those found in modern data centers. We introduce a framework for communication-aware load balancing and design new load balancing algorithms that perform exceptionally well even in scenarios with sparse communication patterns. Central to our approach is state approximation, where the load balancer first estimates server states through a communication protocol. Subsequently, it utilizes these approximate states within a load-balancing algorithm to determine routing decisions. We demonstrate that by using a novel communication protocol, one can achieve accurate queue length approximation with sparse communication: for a maximal approximation error of x, the communication frequency only needs to be 𝑂⁢(1/𝑥2). We further show, via a diffusion analysis, that a constant maximal approximation error is sufficient for achieving asymptotic √𝑛 optimality gap in performance, where n represents the scale of the total arrival and service rates. This is meaningful in situations where the system experiences periods of heavy traffic or overload, as well as situations where the system is underloaded but the servers have different processing speeds and it is not trivial to achieve good performance. Taken together, these results therefore demonstrate that highly performant load balancing is possible with very little communication. Through simulations, we observe that the proposed designs match or surpass the performance of state-of-the-art load balancing algorithms while drastically reducing communication rates by up to 90%.",3.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01223641591529568,False,

This effect occurs because the slider allows participants to engage with the scale as they consider their options. When dragging past each response option, attention is directed to that option, increasing its chance of being selected. Supporting this account, sliders only result in responses closer to the starting point when participants physically drag the cursor across options to their desired response, not when they directly click on it. Furthermore, participants dragging a slider interact with the scale earlier in the judgment process and exhibit a greater visual focus on left-side (vs. right-side) options on the scale compared to participants clicking a radio button.

Telemedicine Trends in Ambulatory Surgical Oncology: A Five-Year Analysis of Visit Volume and Utilization at a High-Volume Academic Center,"Vijaya Parameswaran, Marci Miller, Joshua Pritchett, art Demaerschalk, Yue Hu, Sean Tsung, Yan Bo Zeng, Leah Rosengaus, Christopher Sharp, Byrne Lee, Sumit Shah",,2025,June2025,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/telemedicine-trends-ambulatory-surgical-oncology-five-year-analysis,"Background

Telemedicine is now a sustained modality of ambulatory surgical oncology care, yet its association with workforce utilization, patient volume, and visit type at high-volume academic centers remains understudied. Characterizing these patterns is essential for guiding clinical operations and long-term integration of telemedicine into surgical oncology practice.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study across nine oncology subspecialties at Stanford Medicine’s ambulatory surgical oncology clinics from January 2019 to December 2023 to compare yearly visit volumes and telemedicine use. The study included a total of 231,746 visits, including 50,667 new and 181,079 return visits. We measured overall visit volumes, telemedicine utilization, and their association with increase in unique patients served, including both new and return visits.

Results

In 2023, visit volumes increased by 44% (46,726 to 67,259), and the clinician workforce grew by 16.8% (107 to 125) compared with 2019. The number of unique patients served rose by 39% (20,620 to 28,711), while visits per patient remained stable (2.3 ± 2.1 to 2.3 ± 2.2). Telemedicine use increased from 0.5% (244/46,726) to 37% (24,906/67,259), correlating with serving more patients per year (r = 0.776, p = 0.030) and return visits (r = 0.796, p = 0.010), but not new visits (r = 0.432, p = 0.245).

Conclusions

At this academic medical center, telemedicine use is associated with an expansion of the clinician workforce, an increase in patient volume, and more return visits rather than new visits, without contributing to overall higher healthcare utilization. This suggests that telemedicine can deliver a significant proportion of ambulatory surgical oncological visits while preserving access to care and operational efficiency.",3.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.009658383283544805,False,
Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models,"Keyon Vafa, Susan Athey, David M.

Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is fine-tuned in the standard way: to minimize predictive error. We then provide a set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are √𝑛-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage gap estimation. Classical methods for estimating the adjusted wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages, which can induce omitted variable bias because they condition on coarse summaries of career history. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model, capturing a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the gap.",3.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.04908091830794907,False,gender disparities; gender inequality; gender wage gap; women in the workforce
The Price and Quality of Methylphenidate Products,"Aditya Narayan, Ben Teasdale, A. J. Hudspeth, David Light, Jill K. Nailor, Kevin A. Schulman",American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,2025,American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry May152025,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/price-quality-methylphenidate-products,"Objective

For many products, generic markets are very mature, with aggressive competition driving down the price of products for manufacturers. Under these conditions, manufacturers may not have an ability to invest in high-quality manufacturing processes.

Method

We acquired samples of all available methylphenidate products in immediate-release tablet (IR), extended-release tablet (ERT), and extended-release capsule (ERC) formulations in all available doses from all available labelers listed at one major wholesaler in February 2023. Products were analyzed for variations in dissolution parameters and for the presence of N-nitroso-methylphenidate. Finally, we examined the cost and quality of tested products.

Results

All immediate-release methylphenidate products had similar dissolution profiles. For extended-release products, the confidence intervals of the difference factors for 12 of the 24 generic extended-release tablets sampled did not contain the null value, indicating a statistically significant difference in dissolution from the branded product. N-nitroso-methylphenidate, a probable human carcinogen, was detected above regulatory thresholds in generic immediate-release products for 7 of the 15 unique products sampled. N-nitroso-methlyphenidate was detected below regulatory thresholds in extended-release tablets and was not detected above the limit of quantification in extended-release capsules. The average prices for products with and without elevated N-nitroso-methlyphenidate were not significantly different.

Conclusion

Independent laboratory testing of generic methylphenidate products found significant product quality concerns. Making product quality transparent could offer the potential to dramatically improve the quality of generic drugs at no additional cost.",3.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.024141638414173,False,

Yet for all this policy evaluation, what do we know about policy diffusion—how these policies are introduced and spread from state to state? We present a series of facts based on a data set of 602 U.S. state policies spanning the past 7 decades. First, proxies of state capacity do not predict a higher likelihood of innovating new policies, but the political leaning of the state does predict a higher likelihood of introducing partisan laws since 1990. Second, the diffusion of policies from 1950 to 2000 is best predicted by proximity—a state is more likely to adopt a policy if nearby states have already done so—as well as similarity in voter policy preferences. Third, since 2000, party alignment has become the strongest predictor of diffusion, and the speed of adoption has increased. Models of learning and correlated preferences can account for the earlier patterns, but the findings for the last two decades indicate a sharply increasing role of party control. We conclude that party polarization has emerged as a key factor recently for policy adoption, plausibly leading to a worse match between state policies and voter preferences.",3.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.02751742022838882,False,

The findings show a substantial adverse effect of the app failure on shoppers’ frequency, quantity, and monetary value of purchases, leading to short-term revenue losses of up to $1.08 million, with an additional $1.89 million in potential long-term revenue erosion. The effects are heterogeneous across channels and shoppers. The decline in purchases across channels stems from reduced purchases in stores (vs. online). The decline in store purchases is predominantly explained by the search discontinuation mechanism, wherein shoppers who use the app for search but complete their purchases in stores curtail their offline purchases following the app failure. The effect on purchases in the retailer’s online channel is insignificant, aligning with the channel-switching mechanism, wherein shoppers who use the app primarily to purchase simply pivot to another online channel.

In a longitudinal survey experiment, we find that exposure to three brief, scalable treatments over a week reduces partisan animosity, with effects persisting for at least a month.

Yet, BTM is above one for many firms, particularly in recession years. Recession risk is the extent to which a firm’s equity returns are more sensitive to market returns during recessions than at other times, which could result in BTM above one. Thus, we address whether recession risk helps explain this apparent incongruity. We find that BTM above one generates predictable returns and that these returns (i) are concentrated in recession years; (ii) are explained by a modified version of HML, the BTM-based return explanation factor; and (iii) likely reflect risk rather than mispricing. We also find that returns of firms with BTM above one are more sensitive to expected market risk premiums during recessions. In addition, we find BTM above one reflects potentially overstated equity book values, but only in non-recession years. In contrast, high BTM below one does not generate predictable returns and reflects potentially overstated equity book values in recession and non-recession years. Together, our findings reveal that recession risk helps explain BTM above one, which means that BTM above one has implications for risk assessment, return prediction, and asset under-impairment identification. Our study calls into question using HML as a return explanation factor for BTM above one and using BTM as a generic measure of conservative accounting or as the key indicator of overstated asset book values.",3.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.007756448059193871,False,

Insights From Refusal Patterns for Deceased Donor Kidney Offers,"Grace Guan, Sanjit Neelam, Joachim Studnia, Xingxing S. Cheng, Marc L. Melcher, Michael A. Rees, Alvin E. Roth, Paulo Somaini, Itai Ashlagi",Transplantation,2025,Transplantation May2025,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/insights-refusal-patterns-deceased-donor-kidney-offers,"Background

The likelihood that a deceased donor kidney will be used evolves during the allocation process. Transplant centers can either decline an organ offer for a single patient or for multiple patients at the same time. We hypothesize that refusals for a single patient indicate issues with individual patients, whereas simultaneous refusals for multiple patients indicate issues with organ quality.

Methods

We investigate offer refusal patterns between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023, using Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data. We aggregate refusals at the same timestamp by a center and define a multiple patient refusal as >1 or >5 patients simultaneously refused. We report the refusal codes associated with single and multiple patient refusals and the nonutilization rate after receiving single and multiple patient refusals by cross-clamp.

Results

Patient-related refusal reasons are more commonly single patient refusals, whereas organ-related refusal reasons are more commonly multiple patient refusals. Multiple patient refusals before cross-clamp are associated with nonutilization, but single patient refusals are positively correlated with utilization. The nonutilization rate was 28% for organs without pre-clamp refusals, 35% with a single center sending a multiple patient refusal, but only 12% with a single center sending a single patient refusal.

Conclusions

The risk of nonutilization can be assessed early in the offering process based on the number of single and multiple patient refusals received by a specific time (e.g., cross-clamp).

We randomly sampled companies and obtained data from >200 people knowledgeable about health benefits administration in their organizations. Our novel survey comprehensively inquired about what data concerning health benefits operations companies collected and who, if anyone, was responsible for aspects of employee benefits experience and outcomes. We found a surprisingly small amount of accountability for employer-provided health benefits. For instance, 39% of companies never requested any feedback from their employees about their health benefits, just 6% assessed the time employees spent getting questions about their health benefits answered, and <5% of companies measured how often employees postponed filling a prescription or seeing a doctor because of cost. Moreover, there was a widespread absence of accountability for the performance of health plans.

In this work, we attempt to reconcile these competing positions by considering two additional hypotheses. First, expressing uncertainty may be beneficial in moderate doses, but detrimental in especially small or large doses. Second, followers’ intolerance of uncertainty (i.e., “need for closure”) may be a critical moderator of the relationship between leader-expressed uncertainty and social influence. We conducted five experimental studies to determine whether the link between expressed uncertainty and leader influence may be negative, positive, curvilinear (i.e., inverse U-shaped), and/or moderated by follower’s tolerance of uncertainty. We find overwhelming evidence that the link between expressed uncertainty and leader influence is negative. Leaders who express uncertainty are perceived as less effective, less warm, and less competent. Beyond these subjective evaluations, leader-expressed uncertainty has behavioral consequences, reducing advice-taking, leader selection, and reward allocation.

The senders have a negative average willingness-to-pay (WTP) to send the email, meaning they would rather pay than pressure their peers. The experiment reveals two counteracting motives at play. On the positive side, senders believe that pressuring their peers will persuade them to register. On the negative side, they believe that their peers will dislike being pressured, which outweighs the positive motives. However, under anonymous messaging, they become much less sensitive to whether the recipient dislikes being pressured, and their average WTP turns positive. This pattern of behavior reflects voters who are motivated by the prospect of mobilizing their peers, but are restrained by self-interested concerns from social costs or retaliation.",4.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.008671913355306305,False,

Estimating Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Psychiatry: A Review and Tutorial With Causal Forests,"Erik Sverdrup, Maria Petukhova, Stefan Wager",Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research,2025,Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research April2025 Vol. 34 Issue 2,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/estimating-treatment-effect-heterogeneity-psychiatry-review-tutorial,"Background

Flexible machine learning tools are increasingly used to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects.

Aims

This paper gives an accessible tutorial demonstrating the use of the causal forest algorithm, available in the R package grf.

Summary

We start with a brief non-technical overview of treatment effect estimation methods, focusing on estimation in observational studies; the same techniques can also be applied in experimental studies. We then discuss the logic of estimating heterogeneous effects using the extension of the random forest algorithm implemented in grf. Finally, we illustrate causal forest by conducting a secondary analysis on the extent to which individual differences in resilience to high combat stress can be measured among US Army soldiers deploying to Afghanistan based on information about these soldiers available prior to deployment. We illustrate simple and interpretable exercises for model selection and evaluation, including targeting operator characteristics curves, Qini curves, area-under-the-curve summaries, and best linear projections.

We test the program using a field experiment that includes short stories covering three fundamental financial education topics: compound interest, risk diversification, and inflation. Two surveys are administered eight months apart to measure the effects of those stories on middle-aged and older (45+) participants’ short-term and longer-term knowledge and financial behavior. We show that the risk diversification story is the most effective at improving participants’ knowledge, in both the short and longer terms. In the short term, reading the risk diversification story significantly increased the likelihood of correctly answering the related knowledge questions by 17–18 percentage points. The compound interest and inflation stories significantly increase participant knowledge in the short term, but the gain in financial literacy declines over time. Furthermore, timestamp data was used to show that the inflation story increased the time participants spent answering the related knowledge questions, suggesting that exposure to our story boosted participants’ attentiveness and interest in the topic. Over just an eight-month time period, the stories do not seem to have a significant effect on financial behaviors as measured by four financial distress indicators and a financial resilience index. Nevertheless, higher financial literacy is positively linked to better financial decision-making. The eight months might be too short to measure significant behavioral change; thus, further research is needed to prove the intervention’s effect on financial behavior in the long run.",4.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.0500218850701752,True,education financing

Paying for ads that support far-right candidates, the reasoning went, could help Democrats win in the general elections because it is easier to beat extreme than moderate candidates. In the current research, we ask: how do consumers react to the use of “meddle ads”? On the one hand, because of rising levels of polarization, consumers might be accepting, or even supportive, of meddle ads. On the other hand, because meddle ads might come across as unethical and risky, consumers might be averse to their use. Across 7 main studies and 10 supplemental studies (N = 7,740) using multiple empirical approaches — including conjoint analysis, vignette studies, incentive-compatible donation studies, and analysis of online comments using human coders and NLP tools — we find that consumers are averse to the use of meddle ads. This aversion is driven by three factors: concerns about the character of the candidate, outcome-related risk (losing elections), and system-related risk (losing trust in democracy). These findings contribute to research on political marketing, provide practical guidance for marketers around meddle ads, and identify a novel type of risk perceptions with implications for consumer behavior research.",4.0,School Website,100,Goal 6,0.007251917988690769,False,

When agents can respond strategically to such policies, competition arises, complicating estimation of the optimal policy. In this paper, we study capacity-constrained treatment assignments in the presence of such interference. We consider a dynamic model in which the decision maker allocates treatments at each time step and heterogeneous agents myopically best respond to the previous treatment assignment policy. When the number of agents is large but finite, we show that the threshold for receiving treatment under a given policy converges to the policy’s mean-field equilibrium threshold. Based on this result, we develop a consistent estimator for the policy gradient. In a semisynthetic experiment with data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, we demonstrate that this estimator can be used for learning capacity-constrained policies in the presence of strategic behavior.",4.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.03965427312595635,False,

The visual shapes of letters, contrary to the phonemes of spoken languages, lack a unified description — an equivalent of the phonological features that describe most phonemes in the world’s languages. Using a gamified crowdsourcing approach, we elicited thousands of letter descriptions from lay people for the sets of letter shapes (the scripts) used in 43 diverse writing systems. Using 19,591 letter classifications, contributed by 1,683 participants, who were asked to sort the letters of each script repeatedly into two groups, we extracted a sufficient number of binary classifications (features) to provide a unique description for all letters in the 43 scripts. We show that scripts, compared to phoneme inventories, use more features to produce similar sets of distinct elements. Compared to the phoneme inventories of a large sample of the world’s languages dataset (the P-base dataset, collected by another team), our 43 scripts have lower feature economy (fewer symbols for a given number of features) and lower feature informativeness (a less balanced distribution of feature values). Compared to phonemes, letter shapes require more binary features for a complete description. These features are also less informative in letters than in phonemes: the chances that two random letters in a script differ on any given feature are low.

The problem arises, for example, in settings where randomized controlled trials (RCT) are conducted to evaluate various behavioral science-informed interventions aimed at fostering behavior change (Milkman, Gromet, et al., 2021). Such interventions have been studied across diverse domains, including encouraging gym attendance and increasing vaccine uptake for influenza or COVID-19 (Dai et al., 2021; Milkman, Gromet, et al., 2021; Milkman, Patel, et al., 2021; Milkman et al., 2022). While most studies focus on identifying interventions that perform best on average, this approach often overlooks effect heterogeneity. Ignoring heterogeneity can be a missed opportunity to tailor interventions for maximum effectiveness and may even exacerbate disparities (Bryan et al., 2021). Subject-specific covariates, such as sociodemographics can be harnessed to identify which interventions work best for different segments of the population, allowing for more impactful intervention assignments. The rjaf package provides a user-friendly implementation of the regularized joint assignment forest (RJAF) (Ladhania et al., 2023), a regularized forest-type assignment algorithm based on greedy recursive partitioning (Athey et al., 2019) that shrinks effect estimates across treatment arms. The algorithm is augmented by outcome residualization to reduce baseline variation, and employs a clustering scheme (Hartigan & Wong, 1979) that combines treatment arms with consistently similar outcomes. Personalized treatment learning is achieved by optimizing a regularized empirical analogue of the expected outcome. The integration of R (R Core Team, 2024) and C++ (Stroustrup, 2013) substantially boosts computational efficiency in tree partitioning and aggregating. It is especially suitable in RCT settings with numerous treatment arms and constrained sample sizes, making it a powerful tool for learning personalized intervention strategies.",5.0,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.02413173383158524,False,

With over 10,000 survey responses, this report underscores the significant role Latino entrepreneurs play in shaping the U.S. economy.

Currently, Latinos account for over 70% of the overall increase in the U.S. population (U.S. Census, 2024). Economically, the value of goods and services produced by Latinos in the U.S. reached $3.6 trillion in 2022, making it the fifth-largest economy globally, surpassing the GDPs of the United Kingdom and India. Driving this economic impact is the rapid growth of Latino-owned businesses, which significantly contribute to job creation and economic diversification.

The SLEI survey includes Latino-owned employer businesses (LOBs), with at least one paid employee aside from the owner, generating at least $10,000 in annual revenue, and White-owned employer businesses (WOBs) with the same criteria.

In this report, we explore trends related to a post-pandemic rebound and the resilience of the Latino business segment. Key themes include:

Funding challenges, procurement opportunities, and resilience in the face of obstacles.
Trends in technology adoption and green practices driving operational advancements.
Employment trends and the quality of jobs created by Latino-owned businesses.
Insights into industry distribution and business performance metrics.

This milestone report reflects on the evolution of Latino-owned businesses, reveals critical progress, identifies persistent gaps, and provides insights to guide business leaders, policymakers, and investors in supporting the continued development of this vital entrepreneurial segment.

Additionally, the Latino Business Action Network (LBAN), our collaborator in developing this report and the SOLE Summit, has published a companion white paper based on the research findings.

State and local business subsidies for investment and employment have tripled in size over the past 30 years, but transparency problems inhibit clear assessments of whether subsidies achieve their intended outcomes. We examine both internal disclosure laws, which mandate subsidy reporting by the granting state agency to other state oversight agencies, and external disclosure laws, which mandate reporting to the public. We find positive effects of subsidies on local employment when subsidies are subject to internal disclosure laws; by implementing such regimes, governments could forego 1.2–1.7 subsequent subsidies per county, saving $419.0–$593.5 million in aggregate. In contrast, we observe little effect of external disclosure, which we show is due to governments either substituting to other types of incentives or posting stale information that impedes public monitoring. We contribute to the government disclosure literature by demonstrating the real employment effects of internal government disclosures, and we provide policy-relevant evidence about the conditions under which external disclosure regimes facilitate public monitoring.",5.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.04782207896174938,False,

We argue that bonus plans are an especially important way to provide these incentives because their flexibility allows creditors to more precisely target specific investment objectives. We find that borrowers’ bonus plans tend to have longer horizons and more convex payouts following covenant violations, especially when bonus plans can be a particularly effective way to address distress-related agency conflicts.

Objective: To measure and identify factors associated with financial over nonfinancial emphasis in employer decision-making about health benefits.

Design, Setting, and Participants: A survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of US employers to assess the extent of employers’ emphasis on benefits plans’ costs over member experience, access to care, and equity, and on financial vs other considerations when choosing third-party benefits administrators. The sample included in-company human resources administrators from randomly selected nongovernmental organizations with at least 50 employees. The survey was administered in 2 waves: May 2022 to July 2022 and November 2022 to April 2023.

Exposure: The survey included 41 multipart questions capturing information about the respondent, company, company interactions with benefits consulting firms and benefits administrators, and company approach to managing employee health benefits.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were proportion of financially oriented measures that internal benefits administrators and external benefits consultants use and importance of financial vs other factors in companies’ choice of third-party administrators.

Results: Of 1159 companies sampled, 251 (22%) responded; 30 with less than 50 employees were excluded. Of the 221 remaining companies, 147 (67%) used a benefits consulting firm. The companies and their benefits consultants focused on financial over nonfinancial performance dimensions in decision-making. While 125 companies (74%) tracked trends in health benefits costs and 109 (64%) tracked spending on the highest cost cases, only 14 (8%) tracked time employees spent having questions answered, and 12 (7%) tracked how often employees delayed receiving care because of an insurance company’s actions. This financial focus was largely independent of organizational characteristics and other potential explanatory factors. Of 37 paired differences comparisons in the proportion of financial vs nonfinancial items, only 6 proportions (16%) differed significantly, with differences in proportions of 0.22 or less.

Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, US employers emphasized financial over nonfinancial criteria in their measurement and decision-making about health benefits.

Specifically, gossipers might disproportionately share information about cheaters in their midst, driving cynical perceptions among receivers of that gossip. To test these predictions, we first reanalyzed data from a prior study in which people played a public goods game and could gossip about their fellow players. These participants indeed produced negatively skewed gossip: writing much more frequently about cheaters than cooperators, even when most people in their public goods game groups acted generously. To examine the effect of this gossip on cynicism, we ran a new experiment in which a second generation of participants read these gossip notes, and then prepared to play their own public goods game. Gossip recipients inferred that the groups that produced these notes acted significantly more selfishly than they truly had–becoming both cynical and inaccurate based on gossip. However, this gossip did not affect second generation participants’ forecasts of how their own group would behave, nor their own cooperative choices.

We conceptualize letters of recommendation (LORs) as institutionalized gossip and study these questions in the context of labor markets, where senders choose how much to advocate for a job candidate and receivers decide whether to hire them. We propose that senders of LORs balance advocacy and accuracy based on the strength of their ties with the target and the receiver.

In Experiment 1, participants made decisions within a novel economic game we devised to capture the accuracy-advocacy tradeoff.

We begin with baseline approaches to targeting. First, we target based on a causal forest that estimates heterogeneous treatment effects and then assigns students to treatment according to those estimated to have the highest treatment effects. Next, we evaluate two alternative targeting policies, one targeting students with low predicted probability of renewing financial aid in the absence of the treatment, the other targeting those with high probability. The predicted baseline outcome is not the ideal criterion for targeting, nor is it a priori clear whether to prioritize low, high, or intermediate predicted probability. Nonetheless, targeting on low baseline outcomes is common in practice, for example because the relationship between individual characteristics and treatment effects is often difficult or impossible to estimate with historical data. We propose hybrid approaches that incorporate the strengths of both predictive approaches (accurate estimation) and causal approaches (correct criterion); we show that targeting intermediate baseline outcomes is most effective, while targeting based on low baseline outcomes is detrimental.

However, earnings horizon can be estimated using patterns in return volatility over firms’ reporting cycles, which indicate that EAs have a short horizon and thus reduce investor uncertainty by one-third the amount suggested by event studies.

The retailer’s goal is to maximize a weighted sum of direct profit and customer welfare. Multiple items of the product are produced in batches, and immediately displayed for sale. Considering that each item’s quality decreases while it sits on the shelf, the retailer chooses the shelf life, whether to issue items in FIFO or LIFO order, whether or not to timestamp items, and how to price items. In a base model, we find that the retailer should use LIFO issuance and not timestamp items. The intuition is that this increases customer welfare and allows for a longer shelf life, increasing sales and thus reducing waste. By extending the model, we identify features that can make FIFO optimal (such as a holding cost, upper bound on the shelf life, age-dependent disposal cost, or customer risk- or loss-aversion) and we show how customer heterogeneity can favor timestamps. Lastly, we show how a mandate to donate unsold food items (as implemented in France and California) can motivate a retailer to increase the shelf life, thereby reducing the quality and quantity of donated items.",7.0,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.06392066858258537,True,food markets

We refer to this effect as the convex effect of animation speed.

Using data from 31,348 men and 59,715 women (N = 91,063) from 48 countries who self-identified as heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, or asexual, this study used a fine-grained approach to investigating the relationship of sexual orientation to Holland’s realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional interests, separately by gender. Across these countries, we also explored how the strength of social norms — that is, cultural tightness/looseness — moderates this relationship. Results indicated generally small sexual orientation differences in realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional interests within women and within men. On average, the interests of sexual minorities tend to be less gender-typical, but more investigative and artistic, than those of heterosexual people. Multilevel analyses show that cultural tightness-looseness moderated sexual orientation differences in realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional interests, such that some of these differences are smaller (larger) in tight (loose) cultures. This implies that tight cultures that have strong norms might constrain sexual minorities’ vocational interests, whereas loose cultures that have weak norms offer greater latitude for them to pursue different interests.

However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch, which has facilitated millions of connections between volunteers and nonprofits, a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives directly to a nonprofit’s volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform’s recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for this external traffic in the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the goal of maximizing successful matches. We model the platform’s problem as a special case of online matching, where (using VolunteerMatch terminology) volunteers arrive sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which has a finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is interested only in their targeted opportunity; by contrast, internal traffic may be interested in many opportunities, and the platform’s online algorithm selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating the performance of different algorithms, we refine the notion of competitive ratio by parameterizing it based on the amount of external traffic. After demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly used algorithm that is optimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm, adaptive capacity (AC), which accounts for matches differently based on whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower bound on AC’s competitive ratio that is increasing in the amount of external traffic and that is close to (and, in some regimes, exactly matches) the parameterized upper bound we establish on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm. We complement our theoretical results with a numerical study motivated by VolunteerMatch data where we demonstrate the strong performance of AC relative to current practice and further our understanding of the difference between AC and other commonly used algorithms.",8.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.01207015287938577,False,

To develop a composite score for differential resilience to effects of combat-related stressors (CRS) on persistent DSM-IV post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among US Army combat arms soldiers using survey data collected before deployment.

Methods

A sample of n = 2542 US Army combat arms soldiers completed a survey shortly before deployment to Afghanistan and then again two to three and 8–9 months after redeployment. Retrospective self-reports were obtained about CRS. Precision treatment methods were used to determine whether differential resilience to persistent PTSD in the follow-up surveys could be developed from pre-deployment survey data in a 60% training sample and validated in a 40% test sample.

Results

40.8% of respondents experienced high CRS and 5.4% developed persistent PTSD. Significant test sample heterogeneity was found in resilience (t = 2.1, p = 0.032), with average treatment effect (ATE) of high CRS in the 20% least resilient soldiers of 17.1% (SE = 5.5%) compared to ATE = 3.8% (SE = 1.2%) in the remaining 80%. The most important predictors involved recent and lifetime pre-deployment distress disorders.

Conclusions

A reliable pre-deployment resilience score can be constructed to predict variation in the effects of high CRS on persistent PTSD among combat arms soldiers. Such a score could be used to target preventive interventions to reduce PTSD or other resilience-related outcomes.",8.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.02336976014416214,False,

Nevertheless, it is far from clear that CEO succession planning is any better today than a decade or two ago.

In this Closer Look, we consider the perspective of ValueAct Capital, an institutional investor with extensive, direct experience serving on the boards of directors of portfolio companies during multiple succession events. We explore common deficiencies to the succession process and discuss how succession planning can be improved through the use of an outcomes-based CEO scorecard that matches candidates’ skills against the value drivers of the business.

We ask:

Why do boards commonly fail at succession planning?
Would succession planning improve if boards used an outcomes-based CEO scorecard?
How difficult is it to accurately find the information to populate an outcomes-based scorecard?
Do boards understand and agree on the key strategic and operational goals that underpin an such a scorecard?
Would the CEO succession process be improved if it more closely resembled the investment process?",8.0,School Website,100,Goal 11,0.01349314782393073,False,

Historically, many societies have faced natural hazards, with some adapting through specific social and cultural practices. Understanding these responses is key to developing modern sustainability strategies. Here, we address this issue by developing a mathematical model explicitly accounting for various environmental shock dimensions, cooperative activities common in nonindustrial societies, and decision-making based on material factors as well as personal values and social norms. Our results suggest that cultural looseness can be vital for effectively responding to mild, slow-onset shocks, leading to moderate cooperation and minimal cultural change. Conversely, coping with severe shocks requires an intermediate level of cultural tightness, fostering significant cultural transformation and high cooperation. While tight societies struggle with new shocks, they may handle regular, severe, fast-onset shocks better than do loose societies. Our research enhances understanding of environmental impacts on cooperation, cultural tightness, and social resilience, and highlights cultural adaptations useful in addressing current environmental challenges like global warming, floods, tornadoes, and soil degradation.",8.0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.0980812242852604,True,climate change; climate change planning; climate crisis; climate disasters; climate impact reduction; climate mitigation; climate resilience; climate-resilient development; environmental sustainability; global climate action; sustainable development; sustainable development goals

The resulting estimator converges to an average (over units and time) treatment effect under the correct specification of the assignment model, even if the fixed‐effect model is misspecified. We show that our estimator is more robust than the conventional two‐way estimator: it remains consistent if either the assignment mechanism or the two‐way regression model is correctly specified. In addition, the proposed estimator performs better than the two‐way‐fixed‐effect estimator if the outcome model and assignment mechanism are locally misspecified. This strong robustness property underlines and quantifies the benefits of modeling the assignment process and motivates using our estimator in practice.

We highlight two dimensions in favor of the IV Approach. First, an econometric model of the data generating process reveals that the Border Approach requires a set of identification assumptions that are not easily satisfied in practice: the ignorance of some payoff relevant information and conflicting spatial correlation assumptions. The IV approach, in contrast, exhibits greater internal validity as it is derived from the model that generates the data. Second, the Border Approach suffers from representative issues when the true effect sizes are different between border and off-border regions. We use a common political advertising example to evaluate these estimators and suggest ways to evaluate or limit the above concerns, such as excluding localities that are a large share of the policy making region and evaluating spatial correlations of observables. We find the Border Approach’s representative issue to be substantial when the ignorance assumption is most plausible and observed spatial correlations do not reflect those needed in the unobservables for consistency of the estimator. The IV, in contrast, does not exhibit concerns related to local average treatment effects.

Exposure to the Views of Opposing Others with Latent Cognitive Differences Results in Social Influence — But Only When Those Differences Remain Obscured,"Douglas R.

Yet the learning benefits of exposure to the ideas of cognitively dissimilar others often fail to materialize. Why do cognitive differences produce learning from interpersonal influence in some contexts but not in others? To answer this question, we distinguish between cognition that is expressed — one’s public stance on an issue and the way in which supporting arguments are framed — and cognition that is latent — the semantic associations that underpin these expressions. We theorize that, when latent cognition is obscured, one is more likely to be influenced to change one’s mind on an issue when exposed to the opposing ideas of cognitively dissimilar, rather than similar, others. When latent cognition is instead observable, a subtle similarity-attraction response tends to counteract the potency of cognitive differences — even when social identity cues and other categorical distinctions are inaccessible. To evaluate these ideas, we introduce a novel experimental paradigm in which participants (a) respond to a polarizing scenario; (b) view an opposing argument by another whose latent cognition is either similar to or different from their own and is either observable or obscured; and (c) have an opportunity to respond again to the scenario. A preregistered study (n = 1,000) finds support for our theory. A supplemental study (n = 200) suggests that the social influence of latent cognitive differences operates through the mechanism of argument novelty. We discuss implications of these findings for research on social influence, collective intelligence, and cognitive diversity in groups.",9.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.02539922977653866,False,

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of persistent confounding: unobserved confounders that can simultaneously affect the treatment, short-term outcomes, and long-term outcome. In particular, persistent confounding invalidates identification strategies in previous approaches to this problem. To address this challenge, we exploit the sequential structure of multiple short-term outcomes and develop several novel identification strategies for the average long-term treatment effect. Based on these, we develop estimation and inference methods with asymptotic guarantees.

We find that measures of IRQ based on seven textual attributes are negatively related to synchronicity, which is consistent with higher quality text containing more firm-specific content. Using PhraseLDA to identify topics in integrated reports, we find that contents related to the three most common categories—governance, performance, and risks and opportunities—are negatively associated with synchronicity. We find similar results for all integrated report capitals, except manufactured capital. Further, we find that sustainability information has a larger negative association with synchronicity than financial information.

Globally, billions of people use online platforms and digital devices to communicate, socialize, study, shop, and work. In the process, they generate a vast trove of digital footprints, documenting their thoughts, feelings, actions, and interactions. Social exchanges, for example, are captured in emails, instant messages, and social networking platforms. Expressions of attitudes and biases manifest in blog articles, online profiles, and social media posts. Online job markets and retail platforms capture our occupational and economic activities. Collaborative behaviors are traceable through corporate project management tools and massive multiplayer online games. Emotional states and well-being leave traces in language and digital images. Intimate attributes like sexual preferences and romantic choices are exposed on online dating sites. Moreover, even offline behaviors and social interactions are increasingly monitored by digital sensors in smartphones, wearable devices, smart buildings, and vehicles. These digital footprints of thought and behavior are commonly captured and recorded, creating extensive datasets widely referred to as Big Data.

Design: Secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial.

Setting: Medicaid insurance coverage in 2008 for adults on low incomes (defined as lower than the federal-defined poverty line) in Oregon who were uninsured.

Participants: 12 134 participants from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment with in-person data for health outcomes for both treatment and control groups.

Interventions: Health insurance (Medicaid) coverage.

Main outcomes measures: The conditional local average treatment effects of Medicaid coverage on systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c) using a machine learning causal forest algorithm (with instrumental variables). Characteristics of individuals with positive predicted benefits of Medicaid coverage based on the algorithm were compared with the characteristics of others. The effect of Medicaid coverage was calculated on blood pressure and HbA(1c) among individuals with high predicted benefits.

Results: In the in-person interview survey, mean systolic blood pressure was 119 (standard deviation 17) mm Hg and mean HbA(1c) concentrations was 5.3% (standard deviation 0.6%). Our causal forest model showed heterogeneity in the effect of Medicaid coverage on systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c). Individuals with lower baseline healthcare charges, for example, had higher predicted benefits from gaining Medicaid coverage. Medicaid coverage significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (-4.96 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -7.80 to -2.48)) for people predicted to benefit highly. HbA(1c) was also significantly reduced by Medicaid coverage for people with high predicted benefits, but the size was not clinically meaningful (-0.12% (-0.25% to -0.01%)).

Conclusions: Although Medicaid coverage did not improve cardiovascular risk factors on average, substantial heterogeneity was noted in the effects within that population. Individuals with high predicted benefits were more likely to have no or low prior healthcare charges, for example. Our findings suggest that Medicaid coverage leads to improved cardiovascular risk factors for some, particularly for blood pressure, although those benefits may be diluted by individuals who did not experience benefits.",10.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.04987305322440812,False,health coverage; health financing; universal health coverage

Methods: Participants were recruited for semi-structured interviews through purposive and snowball sampling. From 83 outreach attempts, thematic saturation required 19 completed interviews out of the 46 consumer technology executives and impact-focused investors who responded. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory-based content analysis.

Results: Seven coding categories resulted from inductive coding, with 83 sub-codes. The primary themes were: product-based health impact is magnified when matched to user demographics (making an equity mindset important); stakeholders are eager for reliable health metrics, especially those that hold across industry verticals; when capturing health impact, it is critical to include positive (i.e., economically beneficial) externalities. These results allowed for the creation of a logic model with a recommended theory of change for the private sector to develop health strategy.

Discussion: Intentional integration of impact strategy with business priorities will allow teams to design products that promote health, driving buy-in and resource allocation while attracting investment and double returns. For policymakers, it is clear that tech policy and regulation for corporate reporting need to keep pace.

Yet, their validity may be undermined by network interference. This occurs when the treatment of one unit impacts not only its outcome but also that of connected units, biasing traditional treatment effect estimations.

Our framework, termed causal message-passing, is grounded in high-dimensional approximate message-passing methodology. It is tailored for multiperiod experiments and is particularly effective in settings with many units and prevalent network interference. The framework models causal effects as a dynamic process where a treated unit’s impact propagates through the network via neighboring units until equilibrium is reached. This approach allows us to approximate the dynamics of potential outcomes over time, enabling the extraction of valuable information before treatment effects reach equilibrium. Utilizing causal message-passing, we introduce a practical algorithm to estimate the total treatment effect, defined as the impact observed when all units are treated compared to the scenario where no unit receives treatment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across five numerical scenarios, each characterized by a distinct interference structure.",10.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.005524177217566618,False,

Internalizing Peer Firm Product Market Concerns: Supply Chain Relations and M&A Activity,"Farzana Afrin, Jinhwan Kim, Sugata Roychowdhury, Benjamin P. Yost",Journal of Accounting Research,2024,Journal of Accounting Research September2024,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/internalizing-peer-firm-product-market-concerns-supply-chain,"We explore whether firms internalize the product market concerns of their economically linked peers by examining merger and acquisition decisions in the context of customer–supplier relations. Given the extensive transfer of capital, knowledge, and information between merging parties, we hypothesize that customers’ competition concerns discourage their suppliers from engaging in vertically conflicted transactions (i.e., acquisitions of their customers’ rivals or suppliers to those rivals). Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that suppliers are less likely to engage in such transactions when their customers are subject to higher product market competition. Moreover, the effect is more pronounced when suppliers and customers have greater relationship-specific investments and when customers face heightened proprietary information concerns. Using plausibly exogenous variation in common ownership between customers and their rivals as a shock to customers’ competition concerns, we conclude that the link between customers’ competition concerns and supplier acquisitions is likely causal. Our findings suggest that firms alter their investment and strategic decisions in response to the product market competition concerns of their economically related peers.",10.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.007666077954902876,False,
Monetary Tightening and U.S. Bank Fragility in 2023: Mark-to-Market Losses and Uninsured Depositor Runs?,"Erica Xuewei Jiang, Gregor Matvos, Tomasz Piskorski, Amit Seru",Journal of Financial Economics,2024,Journal of Financial Economics September2024 Vol. 159,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/monetary-tightening-us-bank-fragility-2023-mark-market-losses,"We analyze U.S. banks’ asset exposure to a recent rise in the interest rates with implications for financial stability. The U.S. banking system’s market value of assets is $2.2 trillion lower than suggested by their book value of assets accounting for loan portfolios held to maturity. Marked-to-market bank assets have declined by an average of 10% across all the banks, with the bottom 5th percentile experiencing a decline of 20%. Most of these asset declines were not hedged by banks with use of interest rate derivatives. We illustrate in a simple model that uninsured leverage (i.e., Uninsured Debt/Assets) is the key to understanding whether these losses would lead to some banks in the U.S. becoming insolvent— unlike insured depositors, uninsured depositors stand to lose a part of their deposits if the bank fails, potentially giving them incentives to run. We show that a bank’s survival depends on the market beliefs about the share of uninsured depositors who will withdraw money following a decline in the market value of bank assets. If interest rate increases are small such that the bank’s decline in asset values is relatively small, there is no risk of a run equilibrium. However, for sufficiently high increases in interest rates, we have multiple equilibria in which uninsured depositor run making banks insolvent (i.e., a “bad” run equilibrium) becomes a possibility. Banks with smaller initial capitalization and higher uninsured leverage have a smaller range of beliefs supporting a “good” no run equilibrium, increasing their fragility to uninsured depositor runs. A case study of the recently failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is illustrative. 10 percent of banks have larger unrecognized losses than those at SVB. Nor was SVB the worst capitalized bank, with 10 percent of banks having lower capitalization than SVB. On the other hand, SVB had a disproportional share of uninsured funding: only 1 percent of banks had higher uninsured leverage. Combined, losses and uninsured leverage provide incentives for an SVB uninsured depositor run. We compute similar incentives for the sample of all U.S. banks. Even if only half of uninsured depositors decide to withdraw, almost 190 banks with assets of $300 billion are at a potential risk of impairment, meaning that the mark-to-market value of their remaining assets after these withdrawals will be insufficient to repay all insured deposits. If uninsured deposit withdrawals cause even small fire sales, substantially more banks are at risk. Regions with lower household incomes and large shares of minorities are more exposed to the bank risk. We also show that decline in banks’ asset values eroded the ability of banks to withstand adverse credit events — focusing on commercial real estate loans. Overall, these calculations suggest that recent declines in bank asset values very significantly increased the fragility of the U.S. banking system to uninsured depositor runs.",10.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01546939778576961,False,technology bank

It then implements an experimental design that enables the estimation of these effects on JD.com, a large e-commerce platform that is also a publisher of digital ads.

Framework agreements (FAs) are procurement mechanisms used in private and public organizations by which a central procurement agency selects an assortment of products, typically through auctions, and then affiliated organizations can purchase from the selected assortment as needs arise. In Chile’s central procurement agency (ChileCompra), FAs accounted for 23% of the procurement expenditures during 2018-19. However, descriptive analysis of purchase transaction data suggests that some FAs exhibited low levels of competition in the auctions used to select the suppliers, which could potentially result in larger government expenditures. We collaborated with ChileCompra to redesign FAs to enhance competition introducing two important changes: (i) standardize the product catalogue using natural language processing algorithms; (ii) use this product standardization to induce more competition in the auctions to select suppliers. These changes were implemented through an experimental approach in a redesigned Food FA to measure its impact, showing that inducing more intense competition in the auction stage reduced transaction prices by 8%. This pilot study ultimately led ChileCompra to implement a similar design in all of its FAs, and many of the improvements in the design of the FAs were included in the new regulation on government purchases. If we were to extrapolate the savings from our pilot re-design to all of these FAs, the total savings would amount to around $74 million in 2022.",11.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.03203452451464332,False,

Consistent with the view that investors believe workforce gender diversity can be valuable in major firms, we use event studies to demonstrate that U.S. technology firms and financial firms experience more positive stock price reactions when it is revealed that they have relatively higher (versus lower) workforce gender diversity numbers. For instance, we find that Google’s revelation of relatively low workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a negative stock price reaction, whereas eBay’s revelation of relatively high workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a positive stock price reaction. These stock price reactions are both economically and statistically significant; for example, we estimate that if a technology firm had revealed gender diversity numbers that were one standard deviation higher, its market valuation would have increased by $1.11 billion. Corroborating this plausibly causal field evidence, we also find positive investor reactions to workforce gender diversity in randomized experiments using Prolific participants with investing experience; these reactions seem to be underpinned by investors’ beliefs about potential upsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., reduced legal risks; increased creativity) but not by investors’ beliefs about potential downsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., increased conflict).

Consistent with findings from North American populations [A. E. Martin, M. F. Mason, J. Pers. Soc.

This pattern persisted even in the most isolated subgroup of the sample, who had no exposure to Western culture or media.

Despite observers identifying denial as less supportive than validation, those who observed a denial response showed less responsive attitudes toward the poster/target (Studies 1–3) and less support for discussions about discrimination on social media in general (Studies 2–3). Exploratory findings revealed that those who viewed denial comments also judged the transgressor as less racist, and expressed less support and more denial in their own comments. This suggests that even as observers negatively judge denial, their perceptions of the poster are nonetheless negatively influenced, and this impact extends to devaluing the topic of discrimination broadly. We highlight the context of social media, where racial discrimination disclosure — and how people respond to it — may be particularly consequential.",11.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.0642069946647751,True,discrimination; eliminating discrimination

Due to idiosyncrasies of program design, the MFP undercompensated some farmers for their trade war losses — and significantly overcompensated others — based solely on their 2018 crop portfolios. Analyzing over 165,000 affected voters, we show that improved compensation outcomes had negligible impacts on Republican farmers’ midterm turnout and campaign contributions, even though such variation in benefits significantly affected farmers’ propensity to view the intervention as helpful.

The growing policy-learning literature focuses on settings in which policies are learned from historical data in which the treatment assignment rule is fixed throughout the data-collection period. However, adaptive data collection is becoming more common in practice from two primary sources: (1) data collected from adaptive experiments that are designed to improve inferential efficiency and (2) data collected from production systems that progressively evolve an operational policy to improve performance over time (e.g., contextual bandits). Yet adaptivity complicates the problem of learning an optimal policy ex post for two reasons: first, samples are dependent and, second, an adaptive assignment rule may not assign each treatment to each type of individual sufficiently often. In this paper, we address these challenges. We propose an algorithm based on generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators, which nonuniformly reweight the elements of a standard AIPW estimator to control worst case estimation variance. We establish a finite-sample regret upper bound for our algorithm and complement it with a regret lower bound that quantifies the fundamental difficulty of policy learning with adaptive data. When equipped with the best weighting scheme, our algorithm achieves minimax rate-optimal regret guarantees even with diminishing exploration. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm’s effectiveness using both synthetic data and public benchmark data sets.",11.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.04085753674226717,False,

Because the people considered for a reference test have not opted in to allow law enforcement to use their DNA profile in this way, reference testing is viewed by many as an invasion of privacy and by some as unethical. We generalize an existing mathematical optimization model of the genealogy process by incorporating the option of reference testing. Using simulated versions of 17 DNA Doe Project cases, we find that reference testing can solve cases more quickly (although many reference tests are required to substantially hasten the investigative process), but only rarely (<1%) solves cases that cannot otherwise be solved. Through a mixture of mathematical and computational analysis, we find that the most desirable people to test are at the bottom of a path descending from an ancestral couple that is most likely to be related to the target. We also characterize the rare cases where reference testing is necessary for solving the case: when there is only one descending path from an ancestral couple, which precludes the possibility of identifying an intersection (e.g., marriage) between two descendants of two different ancestral couples.",12.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.01009382467822088,False,

Our main results are related to the importance of market structure in explaining the dispersion in procurement prices. We find that market structure explains three times more dispersion than buyer effects.

How do interest rates affect inflation? We finally have a complete economic theory of inflation under interest rate targets and unconstrained liquidity. Its long-run properties mirror those of monetary theory: Inflation can be stable and determinate under interest rate targets, including a peg, analogous to a k-percent rule.

Uncomfortably, stability means that higher interest rates eventually raise inflation, just as higher money growth eventually raises inflation. Sticky prices generate some short-run non-neutrality: Higher nominal interest rates can raise real rates and lower output. A model in which higher nominal interest rates temporarily lower inflation, without a change in fiscal policy, is a harder task. I exhibit one such model, but it paints a more limited picture than standard beliefs. Generically, without a change in fiscal policy, monetary policy can only move inflation from one time to another.

The last decade has provided a near-ideal set of natural experiments to distinguish the principal theories of inflation. Inflation did not show spirals or indeterminacies at the long zero bound.

We report the results of two pre-registered studies—one correlational (N = 771) and one experimental (N = 398)—that together lend support for our theory.

We employ a novel experimental approach to causally estimate complementarities, leveraging rich usage data and advertising experiments that directly affect the usage of only one product at a time to measure complementarities based on consumption rather than purchase. Our approach is particularly useful as digital contexts are characterized by the simultaneous presence of both substitutability and complementarity between products. They also have scant price variation, bundled pricing plans, and infrequent purchase or subscription renewal decisions, often making typical cross-price elasticity measures for complementarities infeasible. We apply our approach to data from a software company with a suite of related products and find evidence for varying degrees of complementarity across both user groups and products. We show that accounting for complementarities significantly affects the measurement of ad effectiveness and may impact ad targeting decisions by the firm. We explore heterogeneity in complementarities, finding that they are larger for users who have used the products heavily in the past, but small or zero for those who have not. Ours is one of the first studies to causally examine complementarity in usage in the context of subscription products, and our identification strategy can be applied to a variety of contexts.",13.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.02542902428621411,False,

Increasing data availability and continuing advancements in predictive analytics provide an opportunity to mitigate demand uncertainty by using demand forecasts. In this work, we study a two-stage prediction-driven staffing framework where the prediction models are integrated with the base (made weeks in advance) and surge (made nearly real-time) nurse staffing decisions in the ED. We quantify the benefit of having the ability to use the more expensive surge staffing and identify the importance of balancing demand uncertainty versus system stochasticity. We also propose a near-optimal two-stage staffing policy that is straightforward to interpret and implement. Last, we develop a unified framework that combines parameter estimation, real-time demand forecasts, and nurse staffing in the ED.

Organizations are increasingly using information about descriptive norms to nudge positive behavior change. When characterizing peer decisions, a standard approach in the literature is to focus on average behavior. In this paper, we argue both theoretically and empirically that not only averages but also the shape of the whole distribution of behavior can play a crucial role in how people react to descriptive norms. Using a representative sample of the U.S. population, we experimentally investigate how individuals react to strategic environments that are characterized by different distributions of behavior, focusing on the distinction between tight (i.e., characterized by low behavioral variance), loose (i.e., characterized by high behavioral variance), and polarized i.e., characterized by u-shaped behavior) environments. We find that individuals indeed strongly respond to differences in the variance and shape of the descriptive norm they are facing: Loose norms generate greater behavioral variance and polarization generates polarized responses. In polarized environments, most individuals prefer extreme actions, which expose them to considerable strategic risk, to intermediate actions that minimize such risk. Furthermore, in polarized and loose environments, personal traits and values play a larger role in determining actual behavior. These nuances of how individuals react to different types of descriptive norms have important implications for company culture, productivity, and organizational effectiveness alike.",13.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.01405516051213515,False,

This setting allows us to separate the effect of competition for classified advertising from other changes brought about by the Internet, and to compare newspapers that relied more or less heavily on classified ads ex ante. We find that, following the entry of CL, local newspapers reliant on classified ads experienced a significant decline in the number of management and newsroom staff, including in the number of editors covering politics. These organizational changes led to a reduction in news coverage of politics and resulted in a decline in newspaper readership, particularly among readers with high political interest. Finally, we document that reduced exposure to local political news was associated with an increase in partisan voting and increased entry and success of ideologically extreme candidates in congressional elections.

Nevertheless, we identify benign conditions where costless model selection is feasible: gradually increasing class complexity, and diminishing marginal returns for best-in-class policy value with increasing class complexity. Our algorithm is based on a novel misspecification test, and our analysis demonstrates the benefits of using model selection for reward estimation. Unlike prior work on model selection in contextual bandits, our algorithm carefully adapts to the evolving bias-variance trade-off as more data is collected. In particular, our algorithm and analysis go beyond adapting to the complexity of the simplest realizable class and instead adapt to the complexity of the simplest class whose estimation variance dominates the bias.

Methods: In this observational study of primary care physicians, we compiled clinical workload and EHR efficiency measures, then linked these measures to 2 years of well-being surveys (using the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index) conducted from April 1, 2019, through October 16, 2020. Physicians were grouped into training and confirmation data sets to develop predictive models for burnout. We used gradient boosting classifier and other prediction modeling algorithms to quantify the predictive performance by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).

Results: Of 278 invited physicians from across 60 clinics, 233 (84%) completed 396 surveys. Physicians were 67% women with a median age category of 45 to 49 years. Aggregate burnout score was in the high range (≥3.325/10) on 111 of 396 (28%) surveys. Gradient boosting classifier of EHR use measures to predict burnout achieved an AUC of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.66).

Recently, multiple generic drugs have been recalled due to the presence of carcinogens, predominantly N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), including an extensive recall of extended-release (ER) metformin products in 2020.

Study Design: Primary pharmaceutical quality testing and database analysis.

Methods: We tested marketed metformin immediate-release (IR) and ER tablets from a wide sample of generic manufacturers for the presence of carcinogenic impurities NDMA and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). We examined the association of level of impurity with drug price and the impact of the 2020 FDA recalls on unit price and prescription fill rate.

Results: Postrecall NDMA levels were significantly lower in metformin ER samples (standardized mean difference = –2.0; P = .01); however, we found continued presence of carcinogens above the FDA threshold in 2 of 30 IR samples (6.67%). Overall, the presence of contaminant levels was not significantly associated with price for either IR (NDMA: R ²= 0.142; P = .981; DMF: R ²= 0.382; P = .436) or ER (NDMA: R ² = 0.124; P = .142; DMF: R ² = 0.199; P = .073) samples.

In this Closer Look, we examine seven important questions about the role, influence, and effectiveness of proxy advisors.

We ask:

Why have researchers been unable to demonstrate the purpose and market role of these firms?
Is the proxy advisory industry a net benefit or cost to shareholders?
What explains the large swings in voting outcomes that seem to be associated with their recommendations?
What research do proxy advisory firms conduct to satisfy themselves that their guidelines are beneficial to shareholders?

Prior research on climate impact of ICT devices and services mostly makes use of life cycle assessment and energy modeling frameworks focused on embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Because these perspectives emphasize the GHGs emissions associated with the construction and distribution of digital devices along production supply chains, not much is known about the GHGs emissions monitored or facilitated by digital device use. In this study, we propose the concept of digital use supply chains (DUSCs) as an orthogonal dimension of digital devices’ life cycle. DUSC refers to the production activities and resource consumption recorded by digital devices. We propose a framework to conceptualize and quantify digital behavior-related GHGs emissions through use of the Screenomics paradigm, where users’ digital screen data are unobtrusively collected moment-by-moment. Through Screenomics’ granular recording of users’ digital behavior, we evaluate behavior-based GHGs emissions traced by the digital devices. DUSC connects individual’s digital behaviors to their global climate change impact, contributing to a more nuanced and complete evaluation of the climate impacts of the digital economy. Our single-case study indicates the estimated scale of the GHGs emissions linked to a user’s one-day digital activities could be three orders of magnitude (1000 times) higher than the emissions associated with the device life cycle alone. DUSC could enable climate change mitigation at a meaningful, actionable level through personalized educational or behavior change programs, and also facilitate novel data-driven feedback loops that may provide digital device users with insights into their personal climate impacts.

One such strategy is customer-managed inventory (CMI) in which the customer (the downstream party) controls the inventory of the supplier (the upstream party). However, the optimal design of the inventory control policy and the required incentive structure for CMI has not been fully explored in the related literature. In this paper, we develop a two-echelon model consisting of a supplier and a customer that captures the interaction between both decision makers. Analysis of this model indicates that achieving the potential benefits of CMI requires suitable incentive mechanisms to be put in place. The two-echelon inventory system model, however, does not give closed-form solutions, which are required to generate an optimal solution to the inventory control and incentive problem. To address this challenge, we propose an approximate model, which decouples the two-echelon model into two newsvendor-type models with each party operating a single-echelon system. This approximate model requires the introduction of additional cost parameters so that the decoupled model captures the cost implications of supplier shortages in the original two-echelon model. By developing appropriate values for these cost parameters, the approximate model yields near optimal results.

The standard method of generating disorder-specific disability scores has lay raters make rankings between pairs of disorders based on brief disorder vignettes. This method introduces bias due to differential rater knowledge of disorders and inability to disentangle the disability due to disorders from the disability due to comorbidities.

Methods

We propose an alternative, data-driven, method of generating disorder-specific disability scores that assesses disorders in a sample of individuals either from population medical registry data or population survey self-reports and uses Generalized Random Forests (GRF) to predict global (rather than disorder-specific) disability assessed by clinician ratings or by survey respondent self-reports. This method also provides a principled basis for studying patterns and predictors of heterogeneity in disorder-specific disability. We illustrate this method by analyzing data for 16 disorders assessed in the World Mental Health Surveys (n = 53,645).

Results

Adjustments for comorbidity decreased estimates of disorder-specific disability substantially. Estimates were generally somewhat higher with GRF than conventional multivariable regression models. Heterogeneity was nonsignificant.

Conclusions

The results show clearly that the proposed approach is practical, and that adjustment is needed for comorbidities to obtain accurate estimates of disorder-specific disability. Expansion to a wider range of disorders would likely find more evidence for heterogeneity.",14.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.01953932412149459,False,mental health

The credibility of such Monte Carlo studies is often limited because of the discretion the researcher has in choosing the Monte Carlo designs reported. To improve the credibility we propose using a class of generative models that has recently been developed in the machine learning literature, termed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which can be used to systematically generate artificial data that closely mimics existing datasets. Thus, in combination with existing real data sets, GANs can be used to limit the degrees of freedom in Monte Carlo study designs for the researcher, making any comparisons more convincing. In addition, if an applied researcher is concerned with the performance of a particular statistical method on a specific data set (beyond its theoretical properties in large samples), she can use such GANs to assess the performance of the proposed method, e.g. the coverage rate of confidence intervals or the bias of the estimator, using simulated data which closely resembles the exact setting of interest. To illustrate these methods we apply Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to the estimation of average treatment effects. In this example, we find that (i) there is not a single estimator that outperforms the others in all three settings, so researchers should tailor their analytic approach to a given setting, (ii) systematic simulation studies can be helpful for selecting among competing methods in this situation, and (iii) the generated data closely resemble the actual data.",15.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0174061047787188,False,

Random forests have been shown to be a flexible and powerful approach to HTE estimation in both randomized trials and observational studies. In particular “causal forests” introduced by Athey, Tibshirani and Wager (Ann. Statist. 47 (2019) 1148–1178), along with the R implementation in package grf were rapidly adopted. A related approach, called “model-based forests” that is geared toward randomized trials and simultaneously captures effects of both prognostic and predictive variables, was introduced by Seibold, Zeileis and Hothorn (Stat. Methods Med. Res. 27 (2018) 3104–3125) along with a modular implementation in the R package model4you.

Neither procedure is directly applicable to the estimation of individualized predictions of excess postpartum blood loss caused by a cesarean section in comparison to vaginal delivery. Clearly, randomization is hardly possible in this setup, and thus model-based forests lack clinical trial data to address this question. On the other hand, the skewed and interval-censored postpartum blood loss observations violate assumptions made by causal forests. Here we present a tailored model-based forest for skewed and interval-censored data to infer possible predictive prepartum characteristics and their impact on excess postpartum blood loss caused by a cesarean section.

As a methodological basis, we propose a unifying view on causal and model-based forests that goes beyond the theoretical motivations and investigates which computational elements make causal forests so successful and how these can be blended with the strengths of model-based forests. To do so, we show that both methods can be understood in terms of the same parameters and model assumptions for an additive model under L₂ loss. This theoretical insight allows us to implement several flavors of “model-based causal forests” and dissect their different elements in silico.

The original causal forests and model-based forests are compared with the new blended versions in a benchmark study exploring both randomized trials and observational settings. In the randomized setting, both approaches performed akin. If confounding was present in the data-generating process, we found local centering of the treatment indicator with the corresponding propensities to be the main driver for good performance. Local centering of the outcome was less important and might be replaced or enhanced by simultaneous split selection with respect to both prognostic and predictive effects.

Little is known about hospital pricing for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Using new price transparency data, we assessed variation in CABG prices across US hospitals and the association between higher prices and hospital characteristics, including quality of care.

Methods and Results

Prices for diagnosis related group code 236 were obtained from the Turquoise database and linked by Medicare Facility ID to publicly available hospital characteristics. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to assess factors predictive of higher prices. Across 544 hospitals, median commercial and self‐pay rates were 2.01 and 2.64 times the Medicare rate ($57 240 and $75 047, respectively, versus $28 398). Within hospitals, the 90th percentile insurer‐negotiated price was 1.83 times the 10th percentile price. Across hospitals, the 90th percentile commercial rate was 2.91 times the 10th percentile hospital rate. Regional median hospital prices ranged from $35 624 in the East South Central to $84 080 in the Pacific. In univariate analysis, higher inpatient revenue, greater annual discharges, and major teaching status were significantly associated with higher prices. In multivariable analysis, major teaching and investor‐owned status were associated with significantly higher prices (+$8653 and +$12 200, respectively). CABG prices were not related to death, readmissions, patient ratings, or overall Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hospital rating.

Conclusions

In this article, we show that Bayesian optimality and wishful thinking are, despite first appearances, compatible. The setting of opposing goals can cause two groups of people with identical prior beliefs to reach opposite conclusions about the same evidence through fully Bayesian calculations. We show that this is possible because, when people set goals, they receive privileged information in the form of affective experiences, and this information systematically supports goal-consistent conclusions. We ground this idea in a formal, Bayesian model in which affective prediction errors drive wishful thinking.

We argue that perceptions of cultural appropriation formed in response to the emergence of cultural omnivorousness as a dominant form of high-status consumption, making boundary-crossing a source of cultural capital. Consequently, the right to adopt a practice from a culture that is not one’s own is determined on the basis of the costs and benefits one is presumed to accrue. People express disapproval at boundary-crossing if they believe it devalues or extracts value at the expense of the target culture. We call this process cultural tariffing. We test our theory in a between-subject experimental design, demonstrating that individuals who enjoy a privileged social position, as inferred from their social identity or socioeconomic status, have less normative latitude to cross cultural boundaries. This is explained by perceptions that these actors are either devaluing or exploiting the target culture. While symbolic boundaries and cultural distinction theories are inconsistent with our results, we find that Americans who are disenchanted about group-based social mobility are the most likely to be outraged by cultural boundary-crossing.

This induces individuals to behave more cooperatively toward gossipers in order to improve their reputations. As a result, gossiping has an evolutionary advantage that leads to its proliferation.

We uncovered four previously undocumented insights. First, we found that price discounts alone effectively increase demand among children 6-11 years old, reconciling conflicting findings in prior literature. Second, product selection based on relative price — a particularly crucial factor in developing regions — drives opposing post-promotion effects: Ironically, marketers should not discount expensive healthy options but rather moderately priced ones. Third, different from prior literature’s practice of directly communicating final prices, discount messages that require older children to derive final prices are more effective. Fourth, repetition can amplify or undermine discounts’ efficacy depending on message complexity and children’s age.

However, aesthetic norms are embedded in cultural contexts that shape the meaning of artist deviance. Deviance is compatible with the ideal of innovation endorsed by loose cultures, yet incongruent with the ideal of conformity prominent in tight cultures. Here we examine how cultural tightness–looseness influences the effect of interpersonal (Studies 1–2) and intrapersonal deviance (Studies 3–4) on various indices of impact, including perceived artist influence, artwork valuation, purchase intention, and recommendation of the artist’s work to a museum. Study 1 shows that Italian participants (looser culture) perceived artists who deviated from the motif used by their contemporary artists as more impactful than Chinese participants (tighter culture). Study 2 shows that the looser U.S. communities’ response to COVID-19 rules, the more impactful they considered deviant artists. Study 3 shows that U.S. participants low in tightness mindset were more likely to recommend artists who deviated from their previous style to a company than artists who consistently followed a single style. Accordingly, Study 4 shows that U.S. participants high in tightness mindset were more likely to recommend nondeviant over deviant artworks to a museum.

Although previous meta-analyses have explored the correlates of nurse burnout, none have estimated their association with health care quality and safety and patient morbidity and mortality.

Objective To evaluate the magnitude and moderators of the association between nurse burnout and patient safety, patient satisfaction, and quality of care.

Data Source The Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases were searched from January 1, 1994, to February 29, 2024.

Study Selection Two reviewers independently identified studies that reported a quantifiable association between nurse burnout and any of the outcomes of patient safety, patient satisfaction, or quality of health care.

Data Extraction and Synthesis The PRISMA 2020 guideline was followed. Two reviewers independently extracted the standardized mean difference (SMD) (Cohen d) estimates for a random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were conducted using prespecified variables.

Main Outcomes and Measures Any measure of patient safety, patient satisfaction, or quality of health care previously associated with nurse burnout.

Results A total of 85 studies (81 cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal) involving 288 581 nurses from 32 countries (mean [SD] age, 33.9 (2.1) years; 82.7% female; mean [SD] burnout prevalence rate with study-specific ascertainments, 30.7% [9.7%]) were included. Nurse burnout was associated with a lower safety climate or culture (SMD, −0.68; 95% CI, −0.83 to −0.54), lower safety grade (SMD, −0.53; 95% CI, −0.72 to −0.34), and more frequent nosocomial infections (SMD, −0.20; 95% CI, −0.36 to −0.04), patient falls (SMD, −0.12; 95% CI, −0.22 to −0.03), medication errors (SMD, −0.30; 95% CI, −0.48 to −0.11), adverse events or patient safety incidents (SMD, −0.42; 95% CI, −0.76 to −0.07), and missed care or care left undone (SMD, −0.58; 95% CI, −0.91 to −0.26) but not with the frequency of pressure ulcers. Nurse burnout was also associated with lower patient satisfaction ratings (SMD, −0.51; 95% CI, −0.86 to −0.17) but not with the frequencies of patient complaints or patient abuse. Finally, nurse burnout was associated with lower nurse-assessed quality of care (SMD, −0.44; 95% CI, −0.57 to −0.30) but not with standardized mortality rate. The associations were consistent across nurses’ age, sex, work experience, and geography and persistent over time. For patient safety outcomes, the association was smaller for the low personal accomplishment subcomponent of burnout than for emotional exhaustion or depersonalization, as well as for nurses with a college education.

Conclusions and Relevance In this systematic review and meta-analysis, nurse burnout was found to be associated with lower health care quality and safety and lower patient satisfaction. This association was consistent across nurse and study characteristics.",16.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.05095084091757102,True,under-5 mortality

A different body of research finds that opposing political views and the people who hold them are seen as repugnant. How could it be that people receptive to opposing political ideas are viewed positively when the political opponents they are receptive to are seen negatively? In seven main (N = 5,286) and nine supplemental studies (N = 3,983 participants in online studies N = 124,493 observations in field data), we reconcile this tension by arguing that the identity of the person one is receptive to determines whether receptiveness carries reputational benefits or costs. When the information source belongs to the opposing party, receptiveness to opposing political views often carries reputational costs. We find these reputational costs across both strong and weak signals of receptiveness, eight different political and social issues, and multiple types of prototypical out-party sources. We argue that these costs arise because members of the opposing party are frequently stereotyped as immoral, and thus receptiveness to their ideas is seen negatively. As a boundary condition, we find that the costs of receptiveness are pronounced for sources who are prototypical of the out-party and attenuate (or even reverse) for sources who are nonprototypical. These findings resolve a seeming contradiction between two distinct literatures in psychology, contribute to a rapidly expanding literature on the interpersonal consequences of receptiveness, and lay the groundwork for understanding novel barriers to, and ultimately solutions for, the lack of cross-party openness and political polarization.",16.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01329489600524282,False,

Furthermore, risk information causes the firm’s price to contain more information when the firm’s investment decisions have the greatest impact on its value, thereby improving real efficiency. Extensions of the model suggest that the impact of risk information on real efficiency may deteriorate when the firm’s manager is excessively exposed to idiosyncratic risk, when the firm’s shareholders are excessively averse to such risk, or when the disclosure concerns a “downside risk.” In sum, my analysis suggests that information regarding firms’ expected values and information regarding firms’ risks significantly differ in their effects on the capital market.",16.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01224909895736949,False,

One approach would be to prioritize getting people in support of the persuader’s position to hold relatively extreme attitudes — an extremity strategy. An alternative approach would be to prioritize getting as many people as possible to support the persuader’s position, regardless of how extreme they are — a consensus strategy. Although some situations might allow persuaders to combine these strategies, the present work examines how people select targets and strategies when a natural tradeoff exists between acquiring fewer people with more extreme attitudes versus more people with less extreme attitudes. Prior work suggests that potential advantages exist for both extremity and consensus strategies. However, the current research finds that people exhibit a strong preference for a consensus strategy when tasked with selecting targets in group persuasion contexts. Further, this preference prevails even when consensus strategies would backfire and cause one’s persuasive efforts to fail. This allure of consensus is demonstrated across eight primary experiments, which also reveal why people are drawn to a consensus strategy as well as explore potential boundary conditions for this preference. This work has implications for understanding how persuaders select targets and strategies in the context of group persuasion.

We investigated the implementation strategy that firms should follow to integrate multiple enterprise systems regarding the timing of adoption and the richness of modules. Borrowing theories from software development literature and enterprise system implementation literature, we developed two IES implementation strategies, i.e., the agile strategy (simple, quick, and flexible) and the phased strategy (rich, phased, and pre-determined). We collected a sample of 675 public firms from 1997 to 2004 at the module level, enabling us to distinguish enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems from customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management (SCM) systems. Our data contained the timing of purchase and “go-live” events of these system modules, helping us understand firms’ detailed implementation decisions. We found that IES returns depend on the choices of ERP and CRM/SCM module foundation, ERP-CRM/SCM sequential connection, and the continued adoption of ERP and CRM/SCM modules. Fewer ERP or CRM/SCM modules at CRM/SCM go-live events, a quicker connection between ERP and CRM/SCM go-live events, and the continued adoption of ERP or CRM/SCM modules all were found to enhance IES returns. Our findings show that the agile strategy leads to more returns from IES than the phased strategy and suggest that firms should integrate multiple enterprise systems by going live with advanced system modules quickly after going live with basic enterprise system modules and by continually adding new modules.",17.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01318022883015687,False,

Why is it so difficult for some companies to find a successor to the outgoing CEO?
When is it better for a company to select a successor who carries forward the strengths of a predecessor, and when is it better to promote someone different?
How can a board maintain control of the process, while still leveraging the expertise, insight, and judgment of the outgoing CEO?
How difficult is the CEO job of a typical, large multinational corporation?
Does the high pay that CEOs receive reflect a limited supply of talent, or governance breakdowns that impede the proper evaluation of talent?

In further empirical analyses, we study a large sample of online restaurant reviews, allowing us to follow the dining behavior and attitudes of over 380,000 individuals from 2005 to 2019. We find that the effects of cosmopolitanism depend on being an omnivore; we also find both cosmopolitans and omnivores make authenticity attributions more frequently than other reviewers.

The emerging autonomous transportation technology has the potential to alleviate these issues, but the decisions of profit-maximizing operators running large autonomous fleets could negatively impact other stakeholders and the transportation system.

In this paper, we propose such a framework, which allows us to study the interplay among mobility service providers (MSPs), public transport authorities, and customers. Our framework combines a graph-theoretic network model for the transportation system with a game-theoretic market model in which MSPs are profit maximizers while customers select individually-optimal transportation options. We apply our framework to data for the city of Berlin and present sensitivity analyses to study parameters that MSPs or municipalities can strategically influence.

Using a large, cross-national sample of public employees, we illustrate this framework and methodology through analysis of matched preferences, experiences, and job satisfaction across six job attributes. We identified that public employees’ varied experiences of job attributes have differential impacts on job satisfaction, contingent upon preferences for the attribute. The only attribute we identified that was insensitive to employee preferences was job security.

This belief is used to justify the increasingly widespread practice of automatically enrolling workers in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans. However, the conclusion that individuals do not save optimally for retirement requires a benchmark for optimal behavior. A reasonable benchmark that is often used in the academic literature is the life-cycle model, in which rational individuals allocate resources over their lifetimes with the aim of avoiding sharp changes in their standard of living. We argue that, under realistic assumptions, the life-cycle model implies that most young people should not save for retirement. First, high-income workers tend to experience wage growth over their careers. For these workers, maintaining as steady a standard of living as possible therefore requires spending all income while young and only starting to save for retirement during middle age. Second, low-income workers, whose wage profiles tend to be flatter, receive high Social Security replacement rates, making optimal saving rates very low. Finally, for all workers, low real interest rates make a front-loaded lifetime spending profile optimal. We show that the welfare costs of automatically enrolling younger workers in defined contribution plans — if they are passive savers who do not opt out immediately — can be substantial, even with employer matching.",18.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.02739593722727783,False,

Most patients receive suboptimal doses and do not achieve glycemic control.

Objective To examine whether a voice-based conversational artificial intelligence (AI) application can help patients with type 2 diabetes titrate basal insulin at home to achieve rapid glycemic control.

Design, Setting, and Participants In this randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 primary care clinics at an academic medical center from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, 32 adults with type 2 diabetes requiring initiation or adjustment of once-daily basal insulin were followed up for 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed from January to February 2023.

Interventions Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive basal insulin management with a voice-based conversational AI application or standard of care.

Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were time to optimal insulin dose (number of days needed to achieve glycemic control), insulin adherence, and change in composite survey scores measuring diabetes-related emotional distress and attitudes toward health technology and medication adherence. Secondary outcomes were glycemic control and glycemic improvement. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Results The study population included 32 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.1 [12.7] years; 19 women [59.4%]). Participants in the voice-based conversational AI group more quickly achieved optimal insulin dosing compared with the standard of care group (median, 15 days [IQR, 6-27 days] vs >56 days [IQR, >29.5 to >56 days]; a significant difference in time-to-event curves; P = .006) and had better insulin adherence (mean [SD], 82.9% [20.6%] vs 50.2% [43.0%]; difference, 32.7% [95% CI, 8.0%-57.4%]; P = .01). Participants in the voice-based conversational AI group were also more likely than those in the standard of care group to achieve glycemic control (13 of 16 [81.3%; 95% CI, 53.7%-95.0%] vs 4 of 16 [25.0%; 95% CI, 8.3%-52.6%]; difference, 56.3% [95% CI, 21.4%-91.1%]; P = .005) and glycemic improvement, as measured by change in mean (SD) fasting blood glucose level (−45.9 [45.9] mg/dL [95% CI, −70.4 to −21.5 mg/dL] vs 23.0 [54.7] mg/dL [95% CI, −8.6 to 54.6 mg/dL]; difference, −68.9 mg/dL [95% CI, −107.1 to −30.7 mg/dL]; P = .001). There was a significant difference between the voice-based conversational AI group and the standard of care group in change in composite survey scores measuring diabetes-related emotional distress (−1.9 points vs 1.7 points; difference, −3.6 points [95% CI, −6.8 to −0.4 points]; P = .03).

Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial of a voice-based conversational AI application that provided autonomous basal insulin management for adults with type 2 diabetes, participants in the AI group had significantly improved time to optimal insulin dose, insulin adherence, glycemic control, and diabetes-related emotional distress compared with those in the standard of care group.

In this regime, we show that the sample paths of a class of sequentially randomized experiments — adapted to this scaling regime and with arm selection probabilities that vary continuously with state — converge weakly to a diffusion limit, given as the solution to a stochastic differential equation. The diffusion limit enables us to derive refined, instance-specific characterization of stochastic dynamics and to obtain several insights on the regret and belief evolution of a number of sequential experiments including Thompson sampling (but not upper-confidence bound, which does not satisfy our continuity assumption). We show that all sequential experiments whose randomization probabilities have a Lipschitz-continuous dependence on the observed data suffer from suboptimal regret performance when the reward gaps are relatively large. Conversely, we find that a version of Thompson sampling with an asymptotically uninformative prior variance achieves near-optimal instance-specific regret scaling, including with large reward gaps, but these good regret properties come at the cost of highly unstable posterior beliefs.",18.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.007460695841170243,False,

We examine the value of DTF, the impact of process uncertainties, and the associated information frictions on this value and the strategic interaction between DTF and FinTech.

Academic/Practical Relevance: As more than 30% of global trade involves bank-intermediated trade finance, examining contract innovation in trade finance (DTF) and its strategic interaction with FinTech is of practical importance. Also, analyzing trade finance in the presence of process dynamics and information frictions complements the existing academic literature.

Methodology: We construct a parsimonious model of a supply chain process consisting of two steps. The duration of each step is uncertain, and the process may fail at either step. Information delay may also occur when verifying the process passing a step. The seller borrows from a bank to finance this two-step process either through uniform financing (the interest rate remains constant throughout the process) or DTF (the interest rates are adjusted according to a precommitted schedule as the process passes each step). When lending, the bank faces a regulatory capital requirement (the bank is required to hold capital reserve when issuing risky loans) or information asymmetry (the seller/borrower possesses more accurate information about the trade process than the bank).

Results: The value of DTF lies in its ability to reduce transactional deadweight loss (under the regulatory capital requirement) and screening (separate high-quality borrowers from the low-quality ones under information asymmetry). This value is greater for more reliable or lengthier trade processes, yet DTF’s ability to screen is stronger when the process is less reliable. The severity of information delay hurts the value of DTF convexly. FinTech that expedites information transmission and verification and enables automatic execution complements DTF, and those that segment customers more efficiently could substitute DTF. Managerial implications: Our results shed light on how the underlying trade process dynamics and the type of information frictions involved affect the optimal deployment of contract innovations (DTF) and FinTech in trade finance.",18.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.03969448366234856,False,

General Manager and Head Coach Exits in the NBA and the NFL,"George Foster, Norm O’Reilly, Jim Best Devereux, Matias Shundi",Emerald Insight,2023,Emerald Insight November2023,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/general-manager-head-coach-exits-nba-nfl,"Purpose

This article seeks to enhance the understanding as to why head coaches and general managers (GMs) in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Football League (NFL) exit from their positions.

Design/methodology/approach

Three hypotheses were investigated using a series of quantitative and qualitative data from the past 30 years. The samples analyzed are comprised of 891 GM and coach annual observations for the NBA clubs and 949 GM and coach observations for the NFL clubs. Analyses include a logit analysis for coach exit/retention, a logit analysis for GM exit/retention and textual analysis via topic modeling via latent Dirichlet allocation.

Findings

Results show a correlation between a coach exiting and a GM exiting simultaneously, thus amplifying the importance of these two roles in enhancing or destroying the success of a club and supporting the need for a deeper understanding of both roles, particularly the GM. The results further highlight cultural differences across clubs in terms of GM and coach turnover, a factor that often is heavily influenced by club ownership.

Originality/value

The results support the role of owners in exits, confirm the importance of winning in avoiding an exit, find a high level of interrelationship between GM and coach exits and show that past culture of firings influences future exit decisions.",18.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.004626747727308901,False,

In conifer forests, the risk of high-intensity fire is reduced by 64.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 41.2 to 77.9%] in areas recently burned at low intensity relative to comparable unburned areas, and protective effects last for at least 6 years (lower bound of one-sided 95% CI: 6 years).

Here, we examined the ripple effects of diversity splits, or faultlines, within hospital teams on patient safety and care. Hospitals consist of hierarchical, mixed-gender, and multiracial units that are prone to conflict. Within a diverse unit, faultlines can occur when multiple attributes (e.g., gender and race) of unit members align and divide a unit into two or more homogeneous subgroups. Yet, little is known about how such faultlines influence patients. Hierarchical path modeling of data collected from 1,102 hospital employees and 4,138 patients across 38 hospital units illustrated that when strong faultlines formed through homogenous subgroups within hospital units resulted in decreased civility among staff. This incivility was related to higher rates of medical error and patient deaths. A 10% increase in unit incivility was linked to a maximum 8.87% increase in healthcare-associated infection rates and a maximum 10.59% increase in mortality rates. However, we found patients within units high on collaborative cultures for managing conflicts — that fostered mutual respect, active listening, and openness to differing opinions — experienced fewer medical errors and lower mortality rates, regardless of strong faultlines.

Neither intervention affected the take-up of short-acting methods, such as the pill. Consistent with theoretical models of consumer search, SDM clients discussed more methods in depth, which led to higher adoption rates for second- or lower-ranked LARCs.

However, the effect of hospitalization in reducing subsequent suicidal behaviors is poorly understood and likely heterogeneous.

Objectives To estimate the association of psychiatric hospitalization with subsequent suicidal behaviors using observational data and develop a preliminary predictive analytics individualized treatment rule accounting for heterogeneity in this association across patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants A machine learning analysis of retrospective data was conducted. All veterans presenting with suicidal ideation (SI) or suicide attempt (SA) from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, were included. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2022, to March 10, 2023. Subgroups were defined by primary psychiatric diagnosis (nonaffective psychosis, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and other) and suicidality (SI only, SA in past 2-7 days, and SA in past day). Models were trained in 70.0% of the training samples and tested in the remaining 30.0%.

Exposures Psychiatric hospitalization vs nonhospitalization.

Main Outcomes and Measures Fatal and nonfatal SAs within 12 months of ED/UC visits were identified in administrative records and the National Death Index. Baseline covariates were drawn from electronic health records and geospatial databases.

Results Of 196 610 visits (90.3% men; median [IQR] age, 53 [41-59] years), 71.5% resulted in hospitalization. The 12-month SA risk was 11.9% with hospitalization and 12.0% with nonhospitalization (difference, −0.1%; 95% CI, −0.4% to 0.2%). In patients with SI only or SA in the past 2 to 7 days, most hospitalization was not associated with subsequent SAs. For patients with SA in the past day, hospitalization was associated with risk reductions ranging from −6.9% to −9.6% across diagnoses. Accounting for heterogeneity, hospitalization was associated with reduced risk of subsequent SAs in 28.1% of the patients and increased risk in 24.0%. An individualized treatment rule based on these associations may reduce SAs by 16.0% and hospitalizations by 13.0% compared with current rates.

Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study suggest that psychiatric hospitalization is associated with reduced average SA risk in the immediate aftermath of an SA but not after other recent SAs or SI only. Substantial heterogeneity exists in these associations across patients. An individualized treatment rule accounting for this heterogeneity could both reduce SAs and avert hospitalizations.",19.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.01357194696328265,False,

Our results suggest that acquirers successfully manipulate M&A deals to avoid antitrust scrutiny, thereby benefiting their own shareholders but potentially harming consumers due to anticompetitive behavior.",19.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.02036180937269787,False,

In this paper we examine how the decision context impacts consumers’ preference between a high-desirability (HD) option and a high-feasibility (HF) alternative. Nineteen studies demonstrate a novel context effect, the “upscaling effect,” whereby introducing a symmetrically dominated decoy option to a set (i.e., an option that is inferior compared to all alternatives in the set) leads to an increase in the choice share of the HD option. To account for the upscaling effect, we advance a two-stage model of consumer decision-making for decisions that involve tradeoffs between desirability and feasibility. According to our model, when the decision context provides a reason for choosing either option, such as when a decoy option is added to the set, consumers prioritize reasons that support choice of HD options over HF alternatives. Our model can explain the upscaling effect, as well as other findings reported in the literature, such as asymmetric attraction effects (Heath and Chatterjee 1995) and asymmetric sales promotion effects (Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989). Further, the upscaling effect holds important managerial implications because it provides an effective way to increase sales of high-end products.",20.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.006758325504255661,False,

First, we show that more generous benefits are associated with a higher operating leverage, operating cash flow volatility, and product-development frequency.

We explore two channels underpinning this association: the performance pay and turnover risk channels, where workers bear risks from noise in performance measurement and unemployment, respectively. We find that the association is stronger when industries use more performance pay for rank-and-file employees and that firms with low reporting quality exhibit high employee turnover. To mitigate endogeneity concerns over omitted firm characteristics, we show that — after the accounting scandals in 2002 and after the announcements of an internal control weakness (ICW) — former Arthur Andersen clients and ICW firms pay wage premiums to employees, with magnitudes between 0.9% to 2.8% of annual wages.",20.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.0254193207422039,False,

We focus on illustrating the potential benefits of optimal information provision in managing the supply side of the marketplace, including the entry, exit, and pricing decisions of potential suppliers. We show that the revenue-optimal information provision policy often involves delaying the disclosure of information regarding the quality of the available suppliers. When the outside options available to consumers are relatively unattractive, we find that information design can help the platform achieve a more revenue-efficient matching between supply and demand. On the other hand, when consumers have access to attractive outside options, we show that information design can accelerate the discovery of high-quality suppliers, leading to an increase in the platform’s total transaction volume. Moreover, in cases where the platform benefits from commission subsidies to incentivize the entry of new suppliers, information design can be used to achieve the same goal while allowing the platform to earn higher commission revenue. Overall, our numerical experiments suggest that the impact of information design on platform revenue, as well as on consumer surplus, can be substantial.",20.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01174653701725717,False,

However, this practice may also adversely affect the welfare of consumers. By optimally designing its information disclosure policy, a platform can influence the entry and pricing decisions of its potential suppliers. In general, it is optimal for the platform to disclose its information only partially to either “nudge” entry when it is a priori costly for suppliers to join or, conversely, discourage it when suppliers do not have access to attractive outside options.

We propose a Modified Unbiased Synthetic Control (MUSC) estimator that guarantees unbiasedness under random assignment and derive its exact, randomization-based, finite-sample variance. We also propose an unbiased estimator for this variance. We document in settings with real data that under random assignment, SC-type estimators can have root mean-squared errors that are substantially lower than that of other common estimators. We show that such an improvement is weakly guaranteed if the treated period is similar to the other periods, for example, if the treated period was randomly selected.

Modern experimentation, however, is often conducted in settings characterized by complex interactions between units. Such interactions can invalidate the standard estimators and make classical experimental designs ineffective. Although the presence of interference forces us to make untestable assumptions on the nature of the interactions even under randomization, sophisticated experimental designs can ameliorate the dependence on such assumptions. In this manuscript, we review the recent and rapidly growing literature on novel experimental designs for these settings. One key feature common to many of these designs is the presence of multiple layers of randomization within the same experiment. We discuss a novel experimental design, called Multiple Randomization Designs or MRDs, that provides a general framework for such experiments.

However, their motives in doing so appear mixed, as complex disclosures are used to obfuscate in some cases and to provide information in others. Building on these observations, we first identify a novel stylized fact: disclosure complexity is non-monotonic in firm performance. We develop a model of disclosure complexity that incorporates the dual roles of complexity and can explain this stylized fact. In the model, a manager discloses to investors of heterogeneous sophistication and can adjust the complexity of the disclosure to either provide more precise information or to obfuscate. When the firm’s investor base is largely unsophisticated, the manager issues a complex disclosure only upon observing negative news. In contrast, when the firm’s investor base is more sophisticated, the manager issues a complex disclosure upon observing either highly positive or negative news. As a result, the market may react more positively to complex information releases than to simple releases, complex disclosures generate heightened return volatility, and firms with more inherently complex information are more likely to use their discretion to simplify their disclosures.",21.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.006582438897674053,False,

The conventional method of measuring consumer surplus based on monetary expenditures is ineffective because these goods’ prices are predominantly zero. Our proposed method addresses this challenge by quantifying the economic value of the time that consumers devote to consuming these free goods. Using data on consumers’ time and monetary expenditures, we calibrate an economic model of the allocation of individuals’ time among internet, television, leisure, and work. We measure the consumer surplus of free goods on the internet as the reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) required to create an equivalent welfare loss to that which would occur if these free goods were no longer available. We find that the average incremental welfare gain from the internet between 2002 and 2011 was about $38 billion per year in the United States, equivalent to approximately 0.29% of the annual GDP. In contrast, if we had not considered the value of time, then the estimated annual incremental welfare gain would have been significantly smaller at about $2.7 billion, only 7% of the estimate derived from our proposed time-based model.

Objective: To measure time from FDA authorization to at least nominal Medicare coverage for technologies requiring a new reimbursement pathway.

Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, public databases were used to associate each technology to billing codes, determine the effective date of each code and Medicare coverage decisions, and stratify by the maturity of the Medicare coverage. At least nominal coverage was defined as achievement of explicit coverage milestones through a national coverage determination, local coverage determinations by Medicare administrative contractors, or by implicit coverage aligned to a new billing code. Characterization by product type (acute treatment, chronic or ongoing treatment, diagnostic assay, and diagnostic device), manufacturer size, and evidence level were assessed for association with coverage achievement. The study included new product applications authorized by the FDA through the premarket approval pathway, the de novo pathway, or with breakthrough designation in the 510(k) pathway from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019.

This may be especially true in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and similar safety-net settings where large-scale, top-down transformation efforts are often associated with declining worker morale and increasing burnout. Innovation contests, which decentralize problem-solving, can be used to involve frontline workers in idea generation and selection.

Objective

We aimed to describe the ideas that frontline clinicians and staff suggested via organizational innovation contests in a national sample of 54 FQHCs.

Interventions

Innovation contests solicited ideas for improving care from all frontline workers — regardless of professional expertise, job title, and organizational tenure and excluding those in senior management — and offered opportunities to vote on ideas.

Participants

A total of 1,417 frontline workers across all participating FQHCs generated 2,271 improvement opportunities.

Approaches

We performed a content analysis and organized the ideas into codes (e.g., standardization, workplace perks, new service, staff relationships, community development) and categories (e.g., operations, employees, patients).

Key Results

Ideas from frontline workers in participating FQHCs called attention to standardization (n = 386, 17%), staffing (n = 244, 11%), patient experience (n = 223, 10%), staff training (n = 145, 6%), workplace perks (n = 142, 6%), compensation (n = 101, 5%), new service (n = 92, 4%), management-staff relationships (n = 82, 4%), and others. Voting results suggested that staffing resources, standardization, and patient communication were key issues among workers.

Conclusions

Innovation contests generated numerous ideas for improvement from the frontline. It is likely that the issues described in this study have become even more salient today, as the COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating impacts on work environments and health/social needs of patients living in low-resourced communities. Continued work is needed to promote learning and information exchange about opportunities to improve and transform practices between policymakers, managers, and providers and staff at the frontlines.",22.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.02654901839386248,False,

Policy-motivated political parties develop ideologies, and voters choose the ideology that best explains their observations. Preferences over policies are then induced by the adopted ideology. Parties thus care about winning the ideological battle as it confers an advantage in the electoral arena. We show that in equilibrium political parties always propose different models of the world. This divergence extends to all features of the environment, not just policy dimensions. A lower degree of policy extremism in the past increases the divergence on the policy dimension, thus leading to higher ideological polarization.",22.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01394046845284713,False,
Improving Match Rates in Dating Markets Through Assortment Optimization,"Ignacio Rios, Daniela Saban, Fanyin Zhen",Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,2023,Manufacturing & Service Operations Management July2023 Vol. 25 Issue 4 Pages 1304–1323.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/improving-match-rates-dating-markets-through-assortment-optimization,"Problem definition: We study how online platforms can leverage the behavioral considerations of their users to improve their assortment decisions. Motivated by our collaboration with a dating company, we study how a platform should select the assortments to show to each user in each period to maximize the expected number of matches in a time horizon, considering that a match is formed if two users like each other, possibly on different periods.

Academic/Practical Relevance: Increasing match rates is one of the most common objectives among many online platforms. We provide insights on how to leverage users’ behavior towards this end.

Methodology: We model the platform’s problem and we use econometric tools to estimate the main inputs of our model, namely, the like and log in probabilities, using our partner’s data. We exploit a change in our partner’s algorithm to estimate the causal effect of previous matches on the like behavior of users. Based on this finding, we propose a family of heuristics to solve for the platform’s problem, and we use simulations and a field experiment to assess the benefits of our algorithm.

Results: First, we find that the number of matches obtained in the recent past has a negative effect on the like behavior of users. Leveraging this finding, we propose a family of heuristics that decide the assortment to show to each user on each day. Finally, using simulations and a field experiment we show that our algorithm can yield 40% more matches relative to our partner’s algorithm.

Managerial Implications: Our results highlight the importance of correctly accounting for the behavior of users on both ends of a transaction to improve the operational efficiency of matching platforms. In addition, we identify and measure the effect of previous matches in the users’ preferences, which is also leveraged by our algorithm. Our methodology can also be applied to online matching platforms in other settings.",22.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.005467597037929136,False,

We consider a stochastic linear bandit setting where decision makers sequentially choose among a set of given actions, observe their noisy rewards, and aim to maximize their cumulative expected reward over a decision-making horizon. The elliptical potential lemma is a key tool for quantifying uncertainty in estimating parameters of the reward function, but it requires the noise and the prior distributions to be Gaussian. Our general elliptical potential lemma relaxes this Gaussian requirement, which is a highly nontrivial extension for a number of reasons; unlike the Gaussian case, there is no closed-form solution for the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution, the covariance matrix is not a deterministic function of the actions, and the covariance matrix is not decreasing with respect to the semidefinite inequality. Although this result is of broad interest, we showcase an application of it to prove an improved Bayesian regret bound for the well-known Thompson sampling algorithm in stochastic linear bandits with changing action sets where prior and noise distributions are general.

People with four-year degrees expect to reap the rewards of their education. This paper examines the pivotal transition from college to the labor market. How do candidates fare when they reveal to prospective employers that they are “first-gen”? Based on the literature, one may advance two competing predictions. One perspective predicts the possibility of a first-gen advantage. This view predicts that revealing one’s first-gen status can help applicants, by making them seem motivated, committed, responsible, and hardworking. It also makes for a compelling narrative; many Americans love stories of “bootstrapped” success. In contrast, a competing perspective predicts the possibility of a first-generation disadvantage. According to this view, there are forces that block decision makers from recognizing the strengths of first-gen students. We tested these two perspectives with an audit study (n = 1,783) and four follow-up studies (n = 4,920). The results supported the first-gen disadvantage hypothesis. Even in the mainstream labor market, first-gen students were evaluated less favorably. We traced this bias to the impact of one possible mechanism: deficit thinking. Despite overcoming hardships, first-gen students were often viewed through the lens of deficits. As a consequence, they were often denied opportunities to gain entry into organizations. Importantly, we found that a mindset shift can help ameliorate the problem. When we nudged decision makers to adopt a strengths-based lens, they became more receptive to hiring first-gen applicants. This work extends knowledge on the mechanisms that drive social class gaps in hiring. It also invites a reassessment of how to study social class in organizations.

We characterize and compare the equilibrium outcomes in three settings: (i) an economy with myopic consumers, who, when making purchase decisions, do not internalize the fact that firms track their behavior and use this information in future transactions; (ii) an economy with forward-looking consumers, who take into account the implications of data tracking when determining their actions; and (iii) an economy where no data-tracking technologies are used due to technological or regulatory constraints.

When Losses Turn into Loans: The Cost of Weak Banks,"Laura Blattner, Luisa Farinha, Francisca Rebelo",American Economic Review,2023,American Economic Review June2023 Vol. 113 Issue 6 Pages 1600–1641.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/when-losses-turn-loans-cost-weak-banks,We provide evidence that banks distort the composition of credit supply in order to comply with ratio-based capital requirements in times of economic distress. An unexpected intervention by the European Banking Authority provides a natural experiment to study how banks respond to falling below minimum required capital ratios during an economic downturn. We show that affected banks respond by cutting lending but also by reallocating credit to distressed firms with underreported loan losses. We develop a method to detect underreported losses using loan-level data. The credit reallocation leads to a reallocation of inputs across firms. We calculate that the resulting increase in input misallocation accounts for about 22 percent of the decline in productivity in Portugal in 2012.,23.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.01472885845839228,False,
Business-Nonprofit Hybrid Organizing: A Dynamic Approach to Balancing Benefits and Costs,"Emma Aveling, Jane E. Roberts, Lauren A.

What form business-nonprofit collaboration should take, however, is a difficult question for managers and leaders. Hybrid organizational forms, which combine for-profit and nonprofit elements within a single organization in unconventional ways, offer an innovative and potentially promising approach. Yet, while existing typologies of cross-sector collaboration have identified hybrid forms at one end of a continuum of possible forms of collaboration, these typologies do not differentiate the diversity such hybrid forms may take, and the costs and benefits of these innovative hybrid forms are poorly understood. This leaves managers interested in promoting public health through business-nonprofit hybrid organizing with limited guidance about how to maximize potential merits while mitigating drawbacks.

Methods: We performed a qualitative comparative case study of three examples of business-nonprofit hybrid organizing. Data collection included 113 interviews with representatives from 42 organizations and observation of case study activities. We used thematic analysis within and across cases to characterize the form of hybrid organizing in each case and to examine benefits and costs of different forms for supporting initiatives.

Results: We identified two hybrid, collaborative forms - Appended and Blended forms. Each form had benefits and costs, the significance of which shifted over time contingent on changing strategic priorities and operating environments. Benefits and costs of particular forms become more or less important for establishing and sustaining initiatives under different conditions, requiring a dynamic view.

Discussion: No particular form of business-nonprofit hybrid organizing is inherently better than another. Optimizing hybrid organizing and ensuring resilient collaborations may mean allowing collaborative forms to evolve. Practitioners can manage tradeoffs between benefits and costs through an ongoing process of assessing the fit between a given collaborative form, strategic priorities, and relevant features of the operating environment. This dynamic view offers important insights for ensuring the resilience of business-nonprofit collaborative efforts to enhance public health.",23.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.0482567882592049,False,health resilience

In stops that result in escalation, officers are more likely to issue commands as their opening words to the driver and less likely to tell drivers the reason why they are being stopped. In study 2, we expose Black males to audio clips of the same stops and find differences in how escalated stops are perceived: Participants report more negative emotion, appraise officers more negatively, worry about force being used, and predict worse outcomes after hearing only the officer’s initial words in escalated versus non-escalated stops.

Decision conflict has featured prominently in psychology literature, going back to the seminal work of Lewin (1933), Miller (1944), and Janis and Mann (1977). Building on this earlier work and the assumption of conflict as an inhibitor of choice, Tversky and Shafir (1992; see also Dhar 1997) argued that the tendency to defer a decision can increase when decision makers experience conflict because of the need to make trade-offs between options in a set. Tversky and Shafir (1992) showed that decision makers may defer choice more when faced with two options presenting trade-offs compared with when they are offered either a single option (see also Dhar 1997) or two options where one alternative dominates the other. Relatedly, Luce (1998) showed that decision makers may be more likely to defer choice when faced with multiple options presenting relatively difficult (versus easy) trade-offs. We reexamine published data and report the results of 40 well-powered direct and conceptual replications of these effects (total n = 26,703) that cast doubt on the replicability of prior research.

Prior research has examined the role of such incidental affect by either focusing on its valence or its arousal, while neglecting the interplay of these two components in the affect infusion process. Based on the affect–integration–motivation (AIM) framework from affective neuroscience, our research proposes a novel arousal transport hypothesis (ATH) that describes how valence and arousal of an affective state jointly influence the evaluation of experiences. We test the ATH in a set of multimethod studies combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), skin conductance recording, automated facial affect recording, and behavioral approaches across a range of sensory modalities including auditory, gustatory, and visual.

Tracking moment-based changes of affective states at the neurophysiological level, we demonstrate that valence mediates reported enjoyment and that arousal is necessary to implement and moderate these mediating effects. We rule out alternative explanations for these mediation patterns such as the excitation transfer account and the attention narrowing account.

Collaboration between clinical and community-based social service organizations is increasingly seen as vital for preventing and managing chronic diseases but has been challenging to establish and sustain.

Purpose 

The aim of this study was to identify organizational barriers and facilitators for clinic–community collaboration.

Methodology/Approach 

We employed multiple methods to study a national sample of nonprofit community-based organizations that each collaborated with local clinical organizations for diabetes prevention in the United States. We used qualitative data collected longitudinally through 65 semistructured interviews from 2016 to 2017 at seven of these organizations and their clinical collaborators to understand their relationships. We employed survey data (N = 247 with 73% response rate) to measure and explore relationships among qualitatively identified themes and collaboration performance.

Results 

We documented three levels of organizational challenges to community–clinic collaboration. Interorganizational challenges pertain to facing only weakly aligned interests across organizations. Interpersonal challenges pertain to misperceptions and miscommunications that occur as frontline employees from differing organizations seek to work together. Task-related challenges pertain to the inadequacy of current processes to effectively link services across clinical and community settings. We found that bridging leadership, provisional teamwork, and learning processes helped to overcome these challenges by enabling iterative progress. Follow-up national survey results indicated that these facilitators were significantly associated with collaboration performance.

Conclusions 

Because community–clinic collaboration presents substantial interorganizational, interpersonal, and task-related challenges, financial incentives alone are likely insufficient for success.

Practice Implications 

Resources that help develop capacity to work across community and clinical settings may be vital and warrant dedicated funding.",24.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.02120655900208397,False,technology facilitation

Arriving customers are shown an assortment of suppliers and may choose to issue a match request to one of them. After spending some time on the platform, each supplier reviews all the match requests she has received and, based on her preferences, she chooses whether to match with a customer or to leave unmatched. We study how platforms should design online assortment algorithms to maximize the expected number of matches in such two-sided settings. We establish that a simple greedy algorithm is 1/2-competitive against an optimal clairvoyant algorithm that knows in advance the full sequence of customers’ arrivals. However, unlike related online assortment problems, no randomized algorithm can achieve a better competitive ratio, even in asymptotic regimes. To advance beyond this general impossibility, we consider structured settings where suppliers’ preferences are described by the multinomial logit and nested logit choice models. We develop new forms of balancing algorithms, which we call preference-aware, that leverage structural information about suppliers’ choice models to design the associated discount function. In certain settings, these algorithms attain competitive ratios probably larger than the standard “barrier” of 1 -1=e in the adversarial arrival model. Our results suggest that the shape and timing of suppliers’ choices play critical roles in designing online assortment algorithms for two-sided matching platforms.",24.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.005859291949122779,False,

In this preregistered study, we used a dataset of ~81,000 Kansas cattle brands (1990–2016) to explore two aspects: (1) the relative influence of copying, pressure for distinctiveness and pressure for complexity on the creation and diffusion of brand components; and (2) the effects of time- and space-averaging on statistical signals. By conducting generative inference with an agent-based model, we found that the patterns in our data are consistent with copying and pressure for intermediate complexity.

We introduce the flexible use and efficient licensing (FUEL) bid language, which was proposed for radio spectrum auctions to ease both communications and computations compared with XOR-based auctions. We model the resulting allocation problem as an integer program, discuss computational complexity, and conduct an extensive set of computational experiments, showing that the winner determination problem of the FUEL bid language can be solved reliably for large realistic-sized problem instances in less than half an hour on average. In contrast, auctions with an XOR bid language quickly become intractable even for much smaller problem sizes. We compare a sealed-bid FUEL auction to a sealed-bid auction with an XOR bid language and to a simultaneous clock auction. The sealed-bid auction with an XOR bid language incurs significant welfare losses because of the missing bids problem and computational hardness, the simultaneous clock auction leads to a substantially lower efficiency than FUEL because of the exposure problem.",24.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.01435757395698864,False,

Yet, this approach leaves us with a “static view” — with no sense of how disciplinary responses fluctuate throughout the year. What if daily discipline rates, and daily discipline disparities, shift over the school year in ways that could inform when and where to intervene? This research takes a “dynamic view” of discipline. It leverages four years of atypically detailed data regarding the daily disciplinary experiences of 46,964 students from 61 middle schools in one of the nation’s largest school districts. Reviewing these data, we find that discipline rates are indeed dynamic. For all student groups, the daily discipline rate grows from the beginning of the school year to the weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving break, falls before major breaks, and grows following major breaks. During periods of escalation, the daily discipline rate for Black students grows significantly faster than the rate for White students — widening racial disparities. Given this, districts hoping to stem discipline and disparities may benefit from timing interventions to precede these disciplinary spikes. In addition, early-year Black–White disparities can be used to identify the schools in which Black–White disparities are most likely to emerge by the end of the school year. Thus, the results reported here provide insights regarding not only when to intervene, but where to intervene to reduce discipline rates and disparities.",25.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.0223498128376213,False,education disparity

Prior research has offered two perspectives that have heretofore been conceptually disconnected. One focuses on personal values, whereas another emphasizes perceptions of the cultural code. We develop a theoretical account that integrates these approaches by linking them to distinct mechanisms and behavioral consequences of cultural fit. We propose that value congruence — the match between one’s values and those that prevail in an organization — relates to the mechanism of group attachment and shapes behavior when one periodically steps back from day-to-day interactions, assesses one’s identification with an organization, and determines whether to stay or voluntarily depart. In contrast, we argue that perceptual congruence — the degree to which one implicitly understands an organization’s prevailing values and norms — relates to the mechanism of interpersonal coordination and influences behavior when one engages in routine peer interactions. Accordingly, we theorize that these two forms of cultural fit relate to distinct behaviors, voluntary exit and linguistic conformity with peers, respectively. Drawing on email and survey data from a midsized technology firm, we find support for our theory and discuss the implications of our findings for research on person-culture fit, dual-process models of culture and cognition, and the pairing of surveys with digital trace data.",25.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01716916532101257,False,

We consider a different type of uncertainty: incomplete knowledge of the mapping between policies and outcomes. In characterizing the optimal agenda setting under this form of uncertainty, we show that it amends substantively the implications of the Romer–Rosenthal model. We then extend the model dynamically and show that rich dynamics emerge under policy uncertainty.

Yet little is known about how clinicians and staff perceive of team membership in healthcare environments where team boundaries are often ambiguous and continually shifting. We draw on the context of primary care in the United States, where fluid multi-disciplinary teamwork is commonly exhorted, to investigate the extent to which clinicians and staff perceive of various roles (e.g., physician, front desk) as members in their teams, and to identify potential implications. Using a survey fielded within 59 clinics (n = 828), we find substantial variation in individuals’ perceptions of the roles they consider as team members during an episode of care (e.g., mean team size = 10.60 roles; standard deviation = 5.09). Perceiving more expansive sets of roles as team members exhibits a positive association with performance as measured by care quality (b = 0.02; p <.01) but a curvilinear association with job satisfaction. Separating an individual’s perceived core (roles always perceived as part of the team) and periphery (roles sometimes perceived as part of the team), perceiving a larger core is positively associated with performance (b = 0.03 p <.01). In contrast, perceiving a larger periphery is marginally negatively associated with performance (b = −0.02, p <.10). This appears to be driven by divergence from the norm perception of the core, i.e., when individuals attribute to the periphery the roles that are considered by most others to be core. Our findings suggest that individuals viewing the roles they must team with more expansively may generate higher quality output but experience a personal toll. Delivering on the ideal of team-based care in dynamic environments may require helping team members gain clarity about their teammates and implementing policies that attend to job satisfaction as team boundaries shift and expand.",25.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.0156875910737849,False,

Academic/practical relevance: Modern buying channels, including e-commerce and public procurement, often consist of a platform that mediates transactions. Frequently, these platforms implement simple and transparent mechanisms to induce suppliers’ direct participation, which typically results in pay-as-bid (or first-price) mechanisms where suppliers set their prices.



Methodology: We introduce a novel class of assortment mechanisms that we call k-soft reserves (k-SRs): if at least k suppliers choose a price below the soft-reserve price, then only those suppliers are added to the assortment; otherwise, all the suppliers are added.



Results: We show the optimality of k-SRs for a class of stylized symmetric models in order to derive the intuition behind the mechanics of these mechanisms. Then, through extensive numerical simulations, we provide evidence of the robustness of k-SRs in more general and realistic settings.

The Divergent Effects of Diversity Ideologies for Race and Gender Relations,Ashley Martin,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,2023,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes March2023 Vol. 175,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/divergent-effects-diversity-ideologies-race-gender-relations,"The present research compares the influence of diversity ideologies on race and gender relations. In contrast to research suggesting that an identity-aware ideology (i.e., multiculturalism or race-awareness) predicts more support for racial equality than does an identity-blind one (i.e., colorblindness or race-blindness), this paper suggests that the opposite is true for gender. Six studies demonstrate that an identity-aware ideology (compared to an identity-blind one) highlights unique types of race and gender differences, leading to divergent outcomes for race and gender inequality. While race-awareness highlights external, opportunity-based differences, promoting support for policies that combat systemic inequality (e.g., affirmative action), gender-awareness highlights internal, biology-based differences, reifying gender-essentialism, broadly, and gender stereotypes, in particular. Together, this work suggests that the beneficial effects of identity-aware ideologies previously found for race may not be effective for gender.

We identify a critical threshold in market structure that determines whether a policy succeeds or fails, and discuss how the design of political institutions can affect this level.

We study whether such measures improve consumer welfare in monopolistic and in competitive markets. We find that consumer control can improve consumer welfare relative to both perfect price discrimination and uniform pricing. First, consumers can use disclosure to amplify competitive forces. Second, consumers can disclose information to induce even a monopolist to lower prices. Whether consumer control improves welfare depends on the disclosure technology and market competitiveness. Simple disclosure technologies suffice in competitive markets.

Seven studies find that people attach gender to seemingly “gender-neutral” stimuli-bifurcating information by “male” and “female”-but that the gender of the stimuli changes as a function of the comparison set. Using stimuli from past work, including shapes (Study 1), species (Study 2), “gender-neutral” traits (Studies 3-4), faces (Study 5), and names (Studies 6-7), these studies demonstrate that gender is relative, where characteristics deemed “female” or “male” exist within a given context. Importantly, these relative evaluations shift perceptions of both gender (i.e., stereotypes) and physical sex (i.e., height, weight) characteristics, with downstream consequences for bias and target judgments (Studies 4-7). In contrast to most work in psychology, which studies gender as an independent variable (to predict differences in stereotypes and outcomes), this work calls for gender to also be considered as a dependent variable that can change as a function of context.

We prove these p-values are positively dependent and enable exact false discovery rate control, although in a relatively weak marginal sense. We then introduce a new method to compute p-values that are valid conditionally on the training data and independent of each other for different test points; this paves the way to stronger type-I error guarantees. Our results depart from classical conformal inference as we leverage concentration inequalities rather than combinatorial arguments to establish our finite-sample guarantees.

(ii) Is the clustered variance estimator valid if we observe a large fraction of the clusters in the population? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these and other questions using a novel framework for clustered inference on average treatment effects. In addition to the common sampling component, the new framework incorporates a design component that accounts for the variability induced on the estimator by the treatment assignment mechanism.

We introduce the concept of dual-growth mindset—viewing both the self and job as malleable—and examine its impact on employee happiness over time. We hypothesize that fostering a dual-growth mindset yields relatively durable gains in happiness, while fostering a growth mindset about either the self or job is insufficient for sustainable increases in happiness. We tested these predictions using two experimental studies: a field quasi-experiment in a Fortune 500 technology company and a controlled experiment with employees in a variety of organizations and occupations. Across the two experiments, fostering dual-growth mindset yielded gains in self-reported and observer-rated happiness that lasted at least six months. Fostering growth mindsets about either the self or job alone did not generate lasting increases in happiness. Supplementary mediation analyses suggest dual-growth mindsets boosted happiness by enabling employees to plan more substantial job crafting.

Substantial variation exists in how well health care is integrated, even across similarly structured organizations, yet research about what physician organizations (POs) do that enables or inhibits integrated care is limited.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to explore the dynamics that enable POs to integrate care.

Methodology/Approach

We ranked a stratified sample of POs according to patient perceptions of integrated care, as measured in a survey. We interviewed professionals, patients, and family members in 10 higher and 3 lower ranked POs about the process of caring for patients with complex conditions. We derived integration-related themes from the interview data and quantified their prevalence. Using a quasi-statistical approach, we explored relationships among themes and their associations with patient perceptions of integrated care.

Results

From 6,104 coded references, we derived a set of themes representing integration perspectives, integration engagement mechanisms, and integration failures. POs experienced frequent integration failures. Higher ranked POs experienced these failures less often because of a combination of functional, interpersonal, and stakeholder engagement mechanisms, which appear to complement one another. Integration perspectives, including both people-oriented and systems-oriented mindsets, appear to play a role in generating these integration dynamics.

Conclusion

Delivering integrated care depends on a PO’s ability to limit integration failures, keeping provider attention focused on patients. Building on the attention-based view, we present a framework suggesting that this ability is a function of both integration perspectives and integration engagement mechanisms.

Practice Implications

POs interested in delivering more integrated care should employ a variety of complementary integration engagement mechanisms and facilitate these efforts by nurturing both people-oriented and system-oriented mindsets among PO decision-makers.",27.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.01968539027098077,False,

Does punishment in bounded organizations look different than punishment in boundaryless organizations? To answer this question, we review and categorize the literature on punishment in organizations according to the boundedness of the organization it examined. We find that though there are similarities in punishment in bounded and boundaryless organizations, punishment in boundaryless organizations involves different actors, punishing different situations, for different reasons, using different methods. However, many questions about punishment in boundaryless organizations remain, including about the pervasiveness, motivations, and impacts that punishment has in boundaryless organizations.",27.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.004554590737747725,False,

Enforceable obligations of good faith and fair dealing play an essential role in facilitating undivided management control of many decisions.

Using data from consumer arbitration cases in the securities industry over the past two decades, where we observe detailed information on case characteristics, the randomly generated list of potential arbitrators presented to both parties, the selected arbitrator, and case outcomes, we establish several motivating facts. These facts suggest that firms hold an informational advantage over consumers in selecting arbitrators, resulting in industry-friendly arbitration outcomes. We then develop and calibrate a quantitative model of arbitrator selection in which firms hold an informational advantage in selecting arbitrators. Arbitrators, who are compensated only if chosen, compete with each other to be selected. The model allows us to decompose the firms’ advantage into two components: the advantage of choosing pro-industry arbitrators from a given pool, and the equilibrium pro-industry tilt in the arbitration pool that arises because of arbitrator competition. Selecting arbitrators without the input of firms and consumers would increase consumer awards by $60,000 on average relative to the current system. Forty percent of this effect arises because the pool of arbitrators skews pro-industry due to competition. Even an informed consumer cannot avoid this pro-industry equilibrium effect. Counterfactuals suggest that redesigning the arbitrator selection mechanism for the benefit of consumers hinges on whether consumers are informed. Policies intended to benefit consumers, such as increasing arbitrator compensation or giving parties more choice would benefit informed consumers but hurt the uninformed.",27.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01891304623167886,False,

We find new ideas diffuse more widely when they socially and intellectually resonate. New ideas become core concepts of science when they reach expansive networks of unrelated authors, achieve consistent intellectual usage, are associated with other prominent ideas, and fit with extant research traditions. These ecological conditions play an increasingly decisive role later in an idea’s career, after their relations with the environment are established. This work advances the systematic study of scientific ideas by moving beyond products to focus on the content of ideas themselves and applies a relational perspective that takes seriously the contingency of their success.",28.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01144194130455989,False,
Ideological Sorting,David P.

People are either ideologues who prefer redistribution over a public good or non-ideologues who prefer a public good that benefits everyone equally. Individuals differ in their productivity with the distribution of productivities the same for both ideologues and non-ideologues. Ideologues back their ideology by working harder when there is redistribution even when not recipients, and non-ideologues work harder when the public good is provided. The tax rate in each district is chosen by majority rule with the median voter theorem identifying the winner. In the focal equilibrium, high productivity ideologues and non-ideologues locate together in a low tax district, and low productivity non-ideologues and ideologues locate together in a high tax district to benefit from redistribution. Middle-income individuals separate with non-ideologues locating in the low tax district and ideologues locating in the high tax district. Ideology thus results in a polarization interval in the middle of the income distribution. If ideology leads to partisanship and a strong party government that chooses the tax rate based on the party median, partisanship widens the polarization interval.",28.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.00920593617650714,False,

Even though in many such marketplaces, prices are set by revenue-maximizing sellers, platforms can influence prices through (i) price-dependent promotion policies that can increase demand for a product by featuring it in a prominent position on the web page and (ii) the information revealed to sellers about the value of being promoted. Identifying effective joint information design and promotion policies is a challenging dynamic problem as sellers can sequentially learn the promotion value from sales observations and update prices accordingly. We introduce the notion of confounding promotion policies, which are designed to prevent a Bayesian seller from learning the promotion value (at the expense of the short-run loss of diverting some consumers from the best product offering). Leveraging these policies, we characterize the maximum long-run average consumer surplus that is achievable through joint information design and promotion policies when the seller sets prices myopically. We then construct a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, in which the seller’s best response to the platform’s optimal policy is to price myopically in every period. Moreover, the equilibrium we identify is platform optimal within the class of horizon-maximin equilibria, in which strategies are not predicated on precise knowledge of the horizon length and are designed to maximize payoff over the worst-case horizon. Our analysis allows one to identify practical long-run average optimal platform policies in a broad range of demand models.",28.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.02311559808115255,False,
Law's Normative Influence on Gender Schemas: An Experimental Study on Counteracting Workplace Bias against Mothers and Caregivers,"Catherine Albiston, Shelley J.

Gender and parenthood are status characteristics that affect decisions about hiring, pay, and promotion through stereotypes that mothers should not work, fathers should not take leave, and caregivers of either gender are less reliable, committed workers. We contend that family-leave laws mitigate these status effects by conveying a consensus that both men and women can legitimately combine work and family. An experiment testing this theory shows that, when the law is not salient, participants pay mothers (whether or not they take leave) and fathers who take leave less and rate them as less promotable than other identical workers. Participants also rate these employees as less competent, committed, and congenial than other identical workers. By contrast, when participants review family-leave laws before they evaluate employees, they treat mothers and caregivers no worse than other workers. Reviewing an organizational family-leave policy did not reduce the effects of stereotypes as much as reviewing formal law. These findings suggest that making law salient during workplace evaluations can reduce inequality through law’s expressive effects.",28.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.06404097253229071,True,gender bias; workplace equality

I build on complex-systems theory, which posits that organizations face a hierarchy of interdependent problems: they must choose how to fulfill different specialized tasks and choose processes to integrate the outputs of these tasks. Because these choices are interdependent, environmental change that directly affects only a few tasks in isolation can indirectly affect the viability of major organizational processes. Recognizing these ripple effects is difficult, however: understanding complex interdependencies is challenging for decision makers, and the division of labor within organizations can create an illusion of separability between tasks. As a result, organizations may respond to such change by engaging in “modular search” for new ways to fulfill specialized tasks, but they may fail to engage in “systemic search” for new processes integrating the outputs of specialized tasks unless they can rely on information-processing structures that help decision makers better understand interdependencies among choices. I test my theory by applying sequence analysis methods to micro-level behavioral data on competitive video gaming (esports) teams.

Addressing dehumanization among American political partisans appears especially crucial, given that it has been linked to their anti-democratic hostility. Perhaps because of its overt nature, partisans recognize — and greatly exaggerate — the extent to which out-partisans explicitly, blatantly dehumanize them. Past research has found that when people perceive they are dehumanized by an outgroup (i.e., meta-dehumanization), they respond with reciprocal dehumanization. Therefore, we reasoned that partisans’ dehumanization could be reduced by correcting their exaggerated meta-dehumanization. Indeed, across three pre-registered studies (N = 4,154), an intervention correcting American partisans’ exaggerated meta-dehumanization reduced their own dehumanization of out-partisans. This decreased dehumanization persisted at a 1-week follow-up and predicted downstream reductions in partisans’ anti-democratic hostility, suggesting that correcting exaggerated meta-dehumanization can durably mitigate the dark specter of dehumanization.",29.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.00296374252049889,False,

Our argument is that similarity breeds attraction in two steps: (a) people categorize someone with a shared attribute as a person like me based on the self-essentialist belief that one’s attributes are caused by an underlying essence and (b) then apply their essence (and the other attributes it causes) to the similar individual to infer agreement about the world in general (i.e., a generalized shared reality). We tested this model in four experimental studies (N = 2,290) using both individual difference and moderation-of-process approaches. We found that individual differences in self-essentialist beliefs amplified the effect of similarity on perceived generalized shared reality and attraction across both meaningful (Study 1) and minimal (Study 2) dimensions of similarity. We next found that manipulating (i.e., interrupting) the two crucial steps of the self-essentialist reasoning process — that is, by severing the connection between a similar attribute and one’s essence (Study 3) and deterring people from applying their essence to form an impression of a similar other (Study 4) — attenuated the effect of similarity on attraction.

Our approach involves training a deep-learning text classifier based on the BERT language representation and defining the typicality of an object in a concept in terms of the categorization probability produced by the trained classifier. Model training allows for the construction of a feature space adapted to the categorization task and of a mapping between feature combination and typicality that gives more weight to feature dimensions that matter more for categorization. We validate the approach by comparing the BERT-based typicality measure of book descriptions in literary genres with average human typicality ratings. The obtained correlation is higher than 0.85.

As people blame current societal problems on culture, the proposed fix is “culture change.” But what is culture change? How does it work? Can it be effective?

This article presents a novel social psychological framework for intentional culture change — actively and deliberately modifying the mutually reinforcing features of a culture. Synthesizing insights from research and application, it proposes an integrated, evidence-based perspective centered around seven core principles for intentional culture change:

Principle 1: People are culturally shaped shapers, so they can be culture changers;
Principle 2: Identifying, mapping, and evaluating the key levels of culture helps locate where to target change;
Principle 3: Culture change happens in both top-down and bottom-up ways and is more effective when the levels are in alignment;
Principle 4: Culture change can be easier when it leverages existing core values and harder when it challenges deep-seated defaults and biases;
Principle 5: Culture change typically involves power struggles and identity threats;
Principle 6: Cultures interact with one another and change can cause backlash, resistance, and clashes; and
Principle 7: Timing and readiness matter. While these principles may be broadly used, here they are applied to the issue of social inequality in the United States. Even though culture change feels particularly daunting in this problem area, it can also be empowering — especially when people leverage evidence-based insights and tools to reimagine and rebuild their cultures.",29.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.02455336951188717,False,social inequality

We find that investors are not homogenous in their viewpoints and demonstrate significant divergence based on age and wealth, with the most vulnerable investors—those who are older and those with low levels of savings—largely opposed to ESG and unwilling to risk their assets to advance these objectives, in contrast to younger, wealthy investors who are much more supportive and willing to forfeit returns. Significant differences in perception of ESG also exist within and across fund companies. The results suggest that fund managers should consider the various viewpoints of their investor base and potentially split their votes on controversial ESG-related proxy proposals to reflect the divergent interests of beneficial owners.

We ask: 

How do fund managers determine how to vote shares regarding ESG-related proxy proposals? 

How rigorous is the analysis they perform regarding the economic impact of these proposals?

How do fund managers balance the interests of their investor base when these interests diverge?

Would split voting improve mutual fund governance by protecting the interest of minority voters—whether that minority is in favor of or opposed to ESG?",29.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01638386277668926,False,

Prior research suggests that group cognitive diversity poses a performance tradeoff: diverse groups excel at creativity and innovation but struggle to take coordinated action. Building on the insight that group cognition is not static but is instead dynamically and interactively produced, we introduce the construct of discursive diversity, a manifestation of group cognitive diversity, which reflects the degree to which the meanings conveyed by group members in a given set of interactions diverge from one another. We propose that high-performing teams are ones that have a collective capacity to modulate shared cognition to match changing task requirements: they exhibit higher discursive diversity when engaged in ideational tasks and lower discursive diversity when performing coordination tasks. We further argue that teams exhibiting congruent modulation — that is, those with low group-level variance in members’ within-person semantic shifts to changing task requirements — are more likely to experience success than teams characterized by incongruent modulation. Using the tools of computational linguistics to derive a measure of discursive diversity and drawing on a novel longitudinal data set of intragroup electronic communications and performance outcomes for 117 remote software development teams on an online platform (www.gigster.com), we find support for our theory. Our findings suggest that the performance tradeoff of group cognitive diversity is not inescapable: groups can navigate it by aligning their levels of discursive diversity to match their task requirements and by having members stay aligned with one another as they make these adjustments.",30.0,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.01715396327143802,False,

In this centralized market, the utility for the system manager from matching any buyer and any seller is a general random variable. We consider a sequence of systems indexed by n where the arrivals in the nth system are sped up by a factor of n. We analyze two families of one-parameter policies: the population threshold policy immediately matches an arriving agent to its best available mate only if the number of mates in the system is above a threshold, and the utility threshold policy matches an arriving agent to its best available mate only if the corresponding utility is above a threshold. Using an asymptotic fluid analysis of the two-dimensional Markov process of buyers and sellers, we show that when the matching utility distribution is light-tailed, the population threshold policy with threshold n/ln n is asymptotically optimal among all policies that make matches only at agent arrival epochs. In the heavy-tailed case, we characterize the optimal threshold level for both policies. We also study the utility threshold policy in an unbalanced matching market with heavy-tailed matching utilities and find that the buyers and sellers have the same asymptotically optimal utility threshold. To illustrate our theoretical results, we use extreme value theory to derive optimal thresholds when the matching utility distribution is exponential, uniform, Pareto, and correlated Pareto. In general, we find that as the right tail of the matching utility distribution gets heavier, the threshold level of each policy (and hence market thickness) increases, as does the magnitude by which the utility threshold policy outperforms the population threshold policy.",30.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01209035655100193,False,

Using transaction-level data from a large retail chain in India, we document consumer strategies that leverage retailers to avoid costs associated with the country’s currency reform policy. We observe both an increase in returns of cash-purchased items that were bought before demonetization (strategic returns) and a spike in final (unreturned) cash purchases with soon-to-be-illegal notes (strategic purchases). Both practices serve consumer incentives either to receive legal notes from the retailer or to avoid depositing cash in formal bank accounts. Our analysis suggests that strategic consumers hindered the intended policy effect while partly benefiting the retail chain, leaving 20 million Indian rupees (INR) ($0.3 million) of demonetized notes outside the formal tax network through this retail chain only; when we scale up the estimates to the country’s market size, the estimated total impact reaches 100 billion INR ($1.5 billion).

However, existing reimbursement models are geared towards the direct provision of clinic care, not population health management. We developed a financial model to assist pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D) clinics design financially sustainable RPM programs based on algorithm-enabled review of CGM data.

Methods: Data were gathered from a weekly RPM program for 302 pediatric patients with T1D at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. We created a customizable financial model to calculate the yearly marginal costs and revenues of providing diabetes education. We consider a baseline or status quo scenario and compare it to two different care delivery scenarios, in which routine appointments are supplemented with algorithm-enabled, flexible, message-based contacts delivered according to patient need. We use the model to estimate the minimum reimbursement rate needed for telemedicine contacts to maintain revenue-neutrality and not suffer an adverse impact to the bottom line.

Results: The financial model estimates that in both scenarios, an average reimbursement rate of roughly $10.00 USD per telehealth interaction would be sufficient to maintain revenue-neutrality. Algorithm-enabled RPM could potentially be billed for using existing RPM CPT codes and lead to margin expansion.

Conclusion: We designed a model which evaluates the financial impact of adopting algorithm-enabled RPM in a pediatric endocrinology clinic serving T1D patients. This model establishes a clear threshold reimbursement value for maintaining revenue-neutrality, as well as an estimate of potential RPM reimbursement revenue which could be billed for. It may serve as a useful financial-planning tool for a pediatric T1D clinic seeking to leverage algorithm-enabled RPM to provide flexible, more timely interventions to its patients.",30.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.02361245078271824,False,

We develop an analytical framework to study experimental design in two-sided marketplaces. Many of these experiments exhibit interference, where an intervention applied to one market participant influences the behavior of another participant. This interference leads to biased estimates of the treatment effect of the intervention. We develop a stochastic market model and associated mean field limit to capture dynamics in such experiments, and use our model to investigate how the performance of different designs and estimators is affected by marketplace interference effects. Platforms typically use two common experimental designs: demand-side (“customer”) randomization (CR) and supply-side (“listing”) randomization (LR), along with their associated estimators. We show that good experimental design depends on market balance: in highly demand-constrained markets, CR is unbiased, while LR is biased; conversely, in highly supply-constrained markets, LR is unbiased, while CR is biased. We also introduce and study a novel experimental design based on two-sided randomization (TSR) where both customers and listings are randomized to treatment and control.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the combinations of system features (i.e., team dynamics, provider-perceived safety culture, and patient care coordination between PCPs) that are most conducive to positively enhancing PCPs’ clinical work satisfaction.

Approach: Nineteen Harvard-affiliated primary care practice sites participated in the Academic Innovations Collaborative 2012-2016, which aimed to establish team-based care and improve patient safety. An All-Staff Survey was administered to 854 PCPs in 2015. The survey measured provider experience of team dynamics, provider-perceived safety culture, patient care coordination between PCPs, and providers’ clinical work satisfaction. We performed a qualitative comparative analysis to identify “recipes,” that is, combinations of conditions necessary and sufficient for enhancing PCPs’ clinical work satisfaction.

Results: Strong provider-perceived safety culture and effective team dynamics constitute sufficient conditions that, when present in practices, could best support PCPs to achieve greater clinical work satisfaction.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest the importance of creating and sustaining a strong safety culture and of establishing and implementing highly functioning teams in primary care practices for enhancing PCPs’ clinical work satisfaction.

Practice implications: Conducting the qualitative comparative analysis provides a new perspective for informing primary care and encouraging primary care practices to pursue strategic priorities for enhancing PCPs’ clinical work satisfaction and providing safe, high-quality care.",30.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.02409531872002806,False,

Objective To report results from the first year of a nationwide randomized clinical trial that provides financial incentives to ESKD facilities and managing clinicians to increase home dialysis rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants Results were analyzed from the first year of the End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choice (ETC) model, a multiyear, mandatory-participation randomized clinical trial designed and implemented by the US Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation. Data were reported on Medicare patients with ESKD 66 years or older who initiated treatment with dialysis in 2021, with data collection through December 31, 2021; the study included all eligible ESKD facilities and managing clinicians. Eligible hospital referral regions (HRRs) were randomly assigned to the ETC (91 HRRs) or a control group (211 HRRs).

Interventions The ESKD facilities and managing clinicians received financial incentives for home dialysis use.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the percentage of patients with ESKD who received any home dialysis during the first 90 days of treatment. Secondary outcomes included other measures of home dialysis and patient volume and characteristics.

Results Among the 302 HRRs eligible for randomization, 18 621 eligible patients initiated dialysis treatment during the study period (mean [SD] age, 74.8 [1.05] years; 7856 women [42.1%]; 10 765 men [57.9%]; 859 Asian [5.2%], 3280 [17.7%] Black, 730 [4.3%] Hispanic, 239 North American Native, and 12 394 managing clinicians.

None of the secondary outcomes differed significantly between groups.

Free Association in a Neural Network,"Russell Richie, Ada Aka, Sudeep Bhatia",Psychological Review,2022,Psychological Review October2022,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/free-association-neural-network,"Free association among words is a fundamental and ubiquitous memory task. Although distributed semantics (DS) models can predict the association between pairs of words, and semantic network (SN) models can describe transition probabilities in free association data, there have been few attempts to apply established cognitive process models of memory search to free association data. Thus, researchers are currently unable to explain the dynamics of free association using memory mechanisms known to be at play in other retrieval tasks, such as free recall from lists. We address this issue using a popular neural network model of free recall, the context maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model, which we fit using stochastic gradient descent on a large data set of free association norms. Special cases of CMR mimic existing DS and SN models of free association, and we find that CMR outperforms these models on out-of-sample free association data. We also show that training CMR on free association data generates improved predictions for free recall from lists, demonstrating the value of free association for the study of many different types of memory phenomena. Overall, our analysis provides a new account of the dynamics of free association, predicts free association with increased accuracy, integrates theories of free association with established models of memory, and shows how large data sets and neural network training methods can be used to model complex cognitive processes that operate over thousands of representations.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.03328798956447827,False,

We find evidence that honor cultures’ focus on virility impedes a key conflict de-escalation strategy — apology — that can be successfully promoted through a shift in mindset. Across five studies using mixed methods (text analysis of congressional speeches, a cross-cultural comparison, surveys, and experiments), people from honor societies (e.g., Turkey and U.S. honor states), people who endorse honor values, and people who imagine living in a society with strong honor norms are less willing to apologize for their transgressions (studies 1–4). This apology reluctance is driven by concerns about reputation in honor cultures. Notably, honor is achieved not only by upholding strength and reputation (virility) but also through moral integrity (virtue). The dual focus of honor suggests a potential mechanism for promoting apologies: shifting the focus of honor from reputation to moral integrity. Indeed, we find that such a shift led people in honor cultures to perceive apologizing more positively and apologize more (study 5). By identifying a barrier to apologizing in honor cultures and illustrating ways to overcome it, our research provides insights for deploying culturally intelligent conflict-management strategies in such contexts.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.01556577894511644,False,conflict-related violence

It applies when the practice’s underlying features are subject to interacting and competing constraints. Our model makes predictions for key features of the teaching process. It predicts a tell-tale distribution of teaching outcomes, with some students near-perfect performers while others receiving the same instruction are disastrously bad. This differs from standard cultural evolution models that rely on direct, high-fidelity copying, which lead to a much narrower distribution of mostly mediocre outcomes.

Our LPM estimates indicate that solar photovoltaic and wind power have both substantially improved their competitive position during the years 2012–2019, primarily due to falling life-cycle costs of production. In California, these gains far outweigh an emerging “cannibalization” effect that results from substantial additions of solar power having made energy less valuable in the middle of the day. As such, intermittent renewables in both states have been approaching or exceeding the break-even value of zero for the estimated LPMs. We also find the competitiveness of natural gas power plants to have either improved in Texas or held steady at negative LPMs in California. For these plants, declining capacity utilization rates have effectively been counterbalanced by a “dispatchability price premium” that reflects the growing market share of intermittent renewables.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.05330819049717411,True,solar energy

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its subsequent interpretation by the Supreme Court gave states the option to expand eligibility for their Medicaid programs in exchange for increases in the generosity of the federal subsidy for the population made eligible by the expansion. States that exercised this option increased Medicaid spending per enrollee on enrollees who were eligible even before the ACA by approximately 15 percent.

The genealogy process is typically the most time-consuming part of — and a limiting factor in the success of — forensic genetic genealogy, which is a new approach to solving violent crimes and identifying human remains. We formulate a stochastic dynamic program that — given the list of matches and their genetic distances to the unknown target — chooses the best decision at each point in time: which match to investigate (i.e., find its ancestors and look for most recent common ancestors between the match and the target), which set of potential most recent common ancestors to descend from (i.e., find its descendants, with the goal of identifying a marriage between the maternal and paternal sides of the target’s family tree), or whether to terminate the investigation. The objective is to maximize the probability of finding the target minus a cost associated with the expected size of the final family tree. We estimate the parameters of our model using data from 17 cases (eight solved, nine unsolved) from the DNA Doe Project. We assess the Proposed Strategy using simulated versions of the 17 DNA Doe Project cases, and compare it to a Benchmark Strategy that ranks matches by their genetic distance to the target and only descends from known common ancestors between a pair of matches. The Proposed Strategy solves cases ≈10-fold faster than the Benchmark Strategy, and does so by aggressively descending from a set of potential most recent common ancestors between the target and a match even when this set has a low probability of containing the correct most recent common ancestor. Our analysis provides a mathematical foundation for improving the genealogy process in forensic genetic genealogy.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.01335831713103672,False,

Using signaling and transparency, we derive arguments implying that observable organizational features representing obviously costly investments convey a sense of authenticity. Using essentialism, we derive alternative counter-arguments that posit unobservable features associated with the intangible essence of a firm will generate perceptions of authenticity. We study distilled spirits producers across a multi-method program of empirical studies including wiki surveys, archival analyses, surveys and online experiments. In the empirical work, we find that producers who present profiles with clusters of observable backward vertical integration activities (including internal production systems) are more likely to be described as authentic by potential consumers. But we also find that individual observable features (e.g., internalized stills, farms) presented in isolation from other features do not consistently appear more salient to consumers than unobservable features (e.g., tradition and terroir). Because they carry multiple messages in varying modalities, profiles of clustered features may be more widely recognized and impactful in projecting authenticity.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.005687356466722393,False,

It has gained considerable popularity thanks to its scalability in large-scale optimization and machine learning. The repeated interactions, however, expose the learner to privacy risks from eavesdropping adversaries that observe the submitted queries. In this paper, we study how to optimally obfuscate the learner’s queries in convex optimization with first-order feedback, so that their learned optimal value is provably difficult to estimate for an eavesdropping adversary. We consider two formulations of learner privacy: a Bayesian formulation in which the convex function is drawn randomly, and a maximin formulation in which the function is fixed and the adversary’s probability of error is measured with respect to a minimax criterion. Suppose that the learner wishes to ensure the adversary cannot estimate accurately with probability greater than 1/ L for some L > 0. Our main results show that the query complexity overhead is additive in L in the maximin formulation, but multiplicative in L in the Bayesian formulation. Compared to existing learner-private sequential learning models with binary feedback, our results apply to the significantly richer family of general convex functions with full-gradient feedback. Our proofs rely on tools from the theory of Dirichlet processes, as well as a novel strategy designed for measuring information leakage under a full-gradient oracle.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.00541171478471845,False,

When the process reaches an upper boundary, the venture succeeds and the entrepreneur receives a reward. When the process reaches a lower boundary, the venture fails. The entrepreneur can choose between two different controls and wishes to determine the policy that maximizes the expected total reward minus total cost. We consider two variations of the model: one in which both boundaries are fixed and one in which only the upper boundary is fixed but the lower is free. We derive closed-form expressions under which the optimal policy will be dynamic versus static; we prove that when the policy is dynamic, it switches between the two controls at most once. The results reveal a subtle trade-off between the cost of the two controls, their drift and their variances, in which controls that are more expensive may be utilized more than controls that are less expensive. We also demonstrate that in the fixed boundary case, the entrepreneur may wastefully use a more expensive control near the lower boundary to avoid hitting that boundary. This implies that efficient utilization of the two controls cannot happen when the entrepreneur does not have the freedom to choose when to abandon the venture.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.008710553350657258,False,

To develop theory on the role of creativity in driving sustained market success, I propose a path dependence theory of creators’ careers that considers creators’ whole portfolios of products over time and how their early portfolios shape their later capacity to sustain success. The main idea is that a creator’s path to sustained success depends on the creativity in their portfolio at the time of their initial hit—relatively creative portfolios give creators more options for leveraging their past portfolios while adapting to market changes, increasing their odds of additional hits. I tested the proposed theory using an archival study of the U.S. music industry from 1959–2010, including data on over 3 million songs by 69,050 artists, and the results largely support the hypotheses. Artists who reached their initial hits with relatively creative (novel or varied) portfolios were more likely to generate additional hits, but a novel portfolio was less likely to yield an initial hit than was a typical portfolio. These findings suggest that new creators face a tradeoff between their likelihood of initial versus sustained success, such that building a relatively creative early portfolio is a risky bet that can make or break a creator’s career.",31.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01045504393388012,False,

We further theorize that changes in group solidarity partly account for the link between group performance and intragroup status.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem. As companies emerge from the pandemic, interventions that prevent the gender gap from widening are critical for retaining a diverse STEM workforce. We evaluate an intervention to improve women’s confidence in their soft skills, an important predictor of workplace retention among women. We leverage rare longitudinal data collected from biotechnology employees immediately before and during the pandemic. Early-career women in the intervention experienced significant gains in their perceived soft skills, while similarly situated women experienced a decline. Furthermore, soft skill improvements were associated with significant increases in retention, suggesting the importance of soft skill development for early-career women post-pandemic.

As the workforce shifts to being predominantly hybrid and remote, how can companies help employees — particularly early-career women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields — develop greater confidence in their soft skills, shown to improve organizational retention? We evaluate the effects of an online longitudinal intervention to develop soft skills among early-career women employees at a North American biotechnology company during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for baseline levels collected immediately prior to nationwide lockdowns, we find that a 6-month online intervention increased early-career women’s assessments of their soft skills at work by an average of 9% (P < 0.001), compared with a decrease of about 3.5% for a matched control group (P < 0.05), resulting in an average treatment effect of nearly 13% on the treated group. Furthermore, we find evidence that the intervention led to an increase in manager-assessed performance for early-career women relative to employees not in the intervention, and that overall, increased self-assessments of soft skill competencies were associated with greater odds of retention.

Does decomposing cost of goods sold entail significant competitive costs? We examine this question using a relaxation of disaggregated manufacturing cost disclosure requirements in Korea. Our survey evidence indicates managers perceive these disclosures to provide a competitive edge to competitors. Using archival data, we find firms with distinctive cost structures and high market shares are less willing to disclose, consistent with a desire to protect cost-leadership advantages embedded in production and sourcing. Firms experience higher gross profits and lower liquidity after withholding manufacturing cost details, suggesting these disclosure decisions involve trading off competitive costs (and not managers’ self-interests) against capital market benefits. At the aggregate level, industries with more nondisclosing firms subsequently experience greater profitability dispersion, suggesting uncertainty about competitors’ cost of goods sold helps drive the widely studied performance dispersion observed within industries.",32.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01680077931391597,False,
Coming of Age: Watching Young Entrepreneurs Become Successful,"Kathryn Shaw, Anders Sørensen",Labour Economics,2022,Labour Economics August2022 Vol. 77,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/coming-age-watching-young-entrepreneurs-become-successful,"The primary goal of this paper is to show that a young entrepreneur, or one who first opens a firm in his or her mid-20s to early 30s, can learn and invest over time to run new, more successful firms with higher productivity and sales. It has been shown by other researchers that most entrepreneurs who are successful started firms in their mid-40s, but what about those founders who are under the age of 35 and are running 42% of all new firms? How successful do they become, and what factors are consistent with their success? Using newly available data from Denmark on firm sales from 2001 to 2016, this paper shows that young founders who become serial entrepreneurs see their sales revenues nearly double between their first and second firms. Commensurate with this sales increase are two underlying factors: (1) young founders become more inclined to register new firms as limited liability corporations (LLCs), which protects them from personal losses if the firm fails; and (2), young founders who are the most successful are portfolio founders, or those who keep their first firms open when they found their second firm. Furthermore, for small firms, the productivity of the firm is often also the productivity of the founder, so just as the personal productivity of wage earners rises with age over their lifecycles, so too does the personal productivity and implied income of young entrepreneurs.",32.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.02067204579991817,False,

However, contrary to popular belief, we argue that egalitarian advocacy predicts greater likelihood to support “succession”-based ageism, which prescribes that older adults step aside to free up coveted opportunities (e.g., by retiring). Although facing their own forms of discrimination, older individuals are perceived as blocking younger people, and other unrepresented groups, from opportunities — that in turn, motivates egalitarian advocates to actively discriminate against older adults. In 9 separate studies (N = 3,277), we demonstrate that egalitarian advocates endorse less prejudice toward, and show more support for, women and racial minorities, but harbor more prejudice toward (Studies 1 and 2), and show less advocacy for (Studies 3–6), older individuals. We demonstrate downstream consequences of this effect, such as support for, and resource allocation to, diversity initiatives (Studies 3–6). Further, we isolate perceived opportunity blocking as a critical mediator, demonstrating that egalitarian advocates believe that older individuals actively obstruct more deserving groups from receiving necessary resources and support to get ahead (Studies 4–6). Finally, we explore the intersectional nature of this effect (Study 7).

Using data on the global movement of portfolio investments in public equity, we find that a 10% increase in private firm disclosure transparency — proxied by the number of disclosed private firms’ financial statement line items — reduces global investors’ demand for public equity by 4.3% or $358 million per investee country-industry. These findings are consistent with private firm disclosures generating negative pecuniary externalities — global investors reallocate their capital away from public firms to more transparent private firms — and less consistent with these disclosures creating positive information externalities that would benefit public firms. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that the reduction in demand for public equity is offset by a comparable increase in capital allocation to more transparent private firms. Using a simulated instruments approach and the staggered implementations of electronic business registers in investee countries in Europe as plausibly exogenous shocks to private firm transparency, we conclude that the negative relationship between private firm disclosures and public equity demand is likely causal.",32.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0494252922604432,False,

In this paper, we consider large-sample asymptotics for treatment effect estimation under network interference in a setting where the exposure graph is a random draw from a graphon. When targeting the direct effect, we establish a central limit theorem and find that-in our setting-popular estimators are considerably more accurate than existing results suggest. Meanwhile, when targeting the indirect effect, we leverage our generative assumptions to propose a consistent estimator in a setting where no other consistent estimators are currently available.

We consider only the case where R has non-positive off-diagonal elements, that is, the direction of reflection is either normal or toward the origin from each axis.

Under that restriction, we define a dual RBM Zˆ that is constructed using the same data (μ,Σ,R) but with certain sign reversals. Using a time reversal argument, we show the following: to find the distribution of the random two-vector Z(t) at an arbitrary time t, assuming that Z(0)=0, it suffices to find the probability that the dual RBM Zˆ, starting from an arbitrary point z in the quarter plane, reaches the origin before time t. Letting t→∞ and assuming that μ and R jointly satisfy the known condition for positive recurrence of Z, we then have the following: to determine the stationary distribution of Z, it suffices to determine the probability that the dual RBM Zˆ, starting from an arbitrary point z, ever reaches the origin.",32.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01224184101232025,False,

Ten studies explore this age-old question and show that gender is a critical feature of perceiving humanness, being more central to conceptions of humanness than other social categories (race, age, sexual orientation, religion, disability). Our first six studies induce humanization (i.e. anthropomorphism) and measure social-category ascription. Across different manipulations (e.g. having participants recall experiences, observe moving shapes, imagine nonhuman entities as people, and create a human form), we find that gender is the most strongly ascribed social category and the one that uniquely predicts humanization. To provide further evidence that gender is central to conceptions of personhood, and to examine the consequences of withholding it, we then demonstrate that removing gender from virtual humans (Study 5), human groups (Study 6), alien species (Study 7), and individuals (Study 8) leads them to be seen as less human. The diminished humanness ascribed to nongendered and genderless targets is due, at least in part, to the lack of a gender schema to guide facile and efficient sense-making. The relative difficulty perceivers had in making sense of nongendered targets predicted diminished humanness ratings. Finally, we demonstrate downstream consequences of stripping a target of gender: Perceivers consider them less relatable and more socially distant (Study 8).

Abnormal increase in trading is concentrated among officers and non-audit committee independent directors, and most pronounced in first-time modified opinions and modified opinions in years where financial results are subsequently restated.

Here, a 30-µm-resolution continuous liquid interface production (CLIP)-based 3D printing system for printing polymeric microstructures is described. This technology combines the high-resolution from projection microstereolithography and the fast print speed from CLIP, thereby achieving micrometer print resolution at x103 times faster than other high-resolution 3D printing technologies.

Finally, despite the unprecedented wave of public support for BLM in summer 2020, many people were hesitant to rejoice over the “victory” because promises may never become progresses, especially considering that the past sixty years have witnessed a decrease, rather than an increase, in racial equity despite all the talking (e.g., a greater racial wealth gap; Miller, 2011, Shapiro, Meschede & Osoro, 2013). Stating an organization’s intention to contribute to a better, more equitable society is a must, but a deep understanding on how organizations should communicate such intentions, and how their words influence the public’s perception is still lacking. In response to the need for more rigorous and systematic research on how organizations communicate their intention to engage in social justice and how the public responds, this symposium has curated five interrelated empirical papers on this timely topic. Embracing a mixed method approach, these papers have combined the strength of archival analysis with experimental methods to showcase various aspects of an organizations’ decisions around rhetoric and communication style, how these decisions are perceived, and why certain strategies are perceived more favorably than others.",33.0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.03932201270052515,False,institutional capacity for climate action

The success of the model is predicated on the ability to profitably convert free users to paying ones. Price promotions (or “sales”) are often used in freemium to induce this conversion. However, the causal effect of exposing consumers to such inter-temporal price variation is unclear. While sales can generate beneficial short-run conversion, they may be harmful in the long-run if consumers inter-temporally substitute purchases to periods with low prices, or use them as signals of low product quality. These long-run concerns may be accentuated in freemium apps, where the base version is sold for free, so that sales form extreme price cuts on the overall product combination. We work with the seller of a free-to-play video game to randomize entering cohorts of users into treatment and control conditions in which promotions for in-game purchases are turned on or off. We observe complete user behavior for half a year, including purchases and consumption of in-game goods, which, in contrast to much of the extant literature, enables us to assess possible substitution over time in consumption directly. We find that conversion and revenue improve in the treatment group; and detect no evidence of harmful inter-temporal substitution or negative inferences about quality from exposure to price variation, suggesting that promotions are profitable. We conjecture that the zero price of the base product that makes its consumption virtually costless, combined with the complementarity between the base product and premium features can help explain this. To the extent that this holds across freemium contexts, the positive effects of promotions documented here may hold more generally.",33.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.01551314186180174,False,consumer behavior

We propose an alternative organizational design that leaders can adopt to overcome these limitations—the Adaptive Hybrid Model.

Third, we find that respondents’ perceptions of the court’s ideology relative to their own are associated with support for institutional changes but with important differences between Democrats and Republicans.

We sought to understand parent, staff, and hospital leader perspectives about family safety reporting in CMC to inform future interventions.

Methods: This qualitative study was conducted at 2 tertiary care children’s hospitals with dedicated inpatient complex care services. A research team conducted approximately 60-minute semistructured, individual interviews with English and Spanish-speaking parents of CMC, physicians, nurses, and hospital leaders. Audio-recorded interviews were translated, transcribed, and verified. Two researchers coded data inductively and deductively developed and iteratively refined the codebook with validation by a third researcher. Thematic analysis allowed for identification of emerging themes.

Results: We interviewed 80 participants (34 parents, 19 nurses and allied health professionals, 11 physicians, and 16 hospital leaders). Four themes related to family safety reporting were identified: (1) unclear, nontransparent, and variable existing processes, (2) a continuum of staff and leadership buy-in, (3) a family decision-making calculus about whether to report, and (4) misaligned staff and parent priorities and expectations. We also identified potential strategies for engaging families and staff in family reporting.

Conclusions: Although parents were deemed experts about their children, buy-in about the value of family safety reporting among staff and leaders varied, staff and parent priorities and expectations were misaligned, and family decision-making around reporting was complex. Strategies to address these areas can inform design of family safety reporting interventions attuned to all stakeholder groups.",33.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.03198042378870457,False,

We explore the personality of counties as assessed through linguistic patterns on social media. Such studies were previously limited by the cost and feasibility of large-scale surveys; however, language-based computational models applied to large social media datasets now allow for large-scale personality assessment.

Method

We applied a language-based assessment of the five factor model of personality to 6,064,267 U.S. Twitter users. We aggregated the Twitter-based personality scores to 2,041 counties and compared to political, economic, social, and health outcomes measured through surveys and by government agencies.

Results

There was significant personality variation across counties. Openness to experience was higher on the coasts, conscientiousness was uniformly spread, extraversion was higher in southern states, agreeableness was higher in western states, and emotional stability was highest in the south. Across 13 outcomes, language-based personality estimates replicated patterns that have been observed in individual-level and geographic studies. This includes higher Republican vote share in less agreeable counties and increased life satisfaction in more conscientious counties.

As a preprocessing step before regression, matching reduces the dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. In current empirical practice, however, the matching step is often ignored in the calculation of standard errors and confidence intervals. In this article, we show that ignoring the matching step results in asymptotically valid standard errors if matching is done without replacement and the regression model is correctly specified relative to the population regression function of the outcome variable on the treatment variable and all the covariates used for matching. However, standard errors that ignore the matching step are not valid if matching is conducted with replacement or, more crucially, if the second step regression model is misspecified in the sense indicated above. Moreover, correct specification of the regression model is not required for consistent estimation of treatment effects with matched data. We show that two easily implementable alternatives produce approximations to the distribution of the post-matching estimator that are robust to misspecification.

Providers’ perspectives of facilitators and barriers to coordination are needed to improve care.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to understand providers’ perspectives on care coordination for patients having multiple chronic diseases served by multiple providers.

RESEARCH DESIGN: Based upon our earlier survey of patients with multiple chronic conditions, we selected 8 medical centers having high and low coordination. We interviewed providers to identify facilitators and barriers to coordination and compare them between patient-rated high sites and low sites and between primary care (PC)-mental health (MH) and PC-medical/surgical specialty care.

SUBJECTS: Physicians, nurses and other clinicians in PC, cardiology, and MH (N=102) in 8 Veterans Affairs medical centers.

RESULTS: We identified warm handoffs, professional relationships, and physical proximity as facilitators, and service agreements, reporting relationships and staffing as barriers. PC-MH coordination was reported as better than PC-medical/surgical specialty coordination. Facilitators were more prevalent and barriers less prevalent in sites rated high by patients than sites rated low, and between PC-MH than between PC-specialty care.

DISCUSSION: We noted that professional relationships were highly related to coordination and both affected other facilitators and barriers and were affected by them. We suggested actions to improve relationships directly, and to address other facilitators and barriers that affect relationships and coordination. Among these is the use of the Primary Care Mental Health Integration model.",34.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.04933082252552336,False,mental health

Ever since, creating intelligence that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our own minds. But not all types of AI are human-like-in fact, many of the most powerful systems are very different from humans-and an excessive focus on developing and deploying HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created. What is more, augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial, there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation among technologists, business executives, and policy-makers.",34.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.02076221150741404,False,

Drawing on extant perspectives on boundary maintenance, we distinguish between two strategies that people pursue in maintaining symbolic boundaries: boundary retention — entrenching themselves in pre-existing symbolic distinctions — and boundary reformation — innovating new forms of symbolic distinction. Traditional approaches to measuring symbolic boundaries — interviews, participant-observation, and self-reports are ill-suited to detecting fine-grained variation in boundary maintenance. To overcome this limitation, we use the tools of computational linguistics and machine learning to develop a novel approach to measuring symbolic boundaries based on interactional language use between group members before and after they encounter one another. We construct measures of boundary retention and reformation using random forest classifiers that quantify group differences based on pre- and post-contact linguistic styles. We demonstrate this method’s utility by applying it to a corpus of email communications from a mid-sized financial services firm that acquired and integrated two smaller firms. We find that: (a) the persistence of symbolic boundaries can be detected for up to 18 months after a merger; (b) acquired employees exhibit more boundary reformation and less boundary retention than their counterparts from the acquiring firm; and (c) individuals engage in more boundary retention, but not reformation, when their local work environment is more densely populated by ingroup members.

Method: We investigate this relationship using information on management practices collected from 510 hospitals in mainland China using the World Management Survey questionnaire and combined with medical malpractice litigation data and patient/staff satisfaction surveys. Multiple regression models were used to analyze the relationship between hospital management scores and medical litigation outcomes as well as patient and staff satisfaction during 2014-2016.

Results: An increase of one standard deviation in the management score was related to 13.1% (p < 0.10) lower incidence of medical disputes, 12.4% (p < 0.05) fewer medical litigations, and 51.3% (p < 0.10) less compensation. Better management quality of hospitals was associated with higher inpatient satisfaction (p < 0.05) and staff well-being (p < 0.01).

Among pairs of firms connected to a network through a common politician, we document an increase in stock price comovement. For those pairs of firms connected to a common network via separate politicians (rather than a common politician), we document a relative decrease in stock price comovement. This negative effect suggests that politicians’ relationships within these political networks are generally adversarial rather than cooperative in nature. These results become significantly weaker during Xi’s regime from 2013 to 2017, suggesting that Xi’s anti-corruption campaign and state-owned enterprise reforms may have attenuated these political network effects on the firms.

Inequality among group members can undermine voluntary cooperation in groups, and this problem is exacerbated when those with less power observe those with more power behave selfishly. We propose, and empirically demonstrate, that even when powerholders behave selfishly and messages are nonbinding and unverifiable, communication with group members fosters cooperation in hierarchical groups. We introduce a novel experimental task to study how communication influences cooperation in groups. In the ABC game, three individuals take turns choosing whether to Add resources to a collective pool (A), Claim resources from that pool (C), or do Both simultaneously (B), thereby gaining less but without depleting the pool. In our study, powerholders made the first choice in each block of decisions and had unlimited power to allocate resources after the task. They were both first movers and final decision makers. We constrained powerholders’ behavior to be selfish or cooperative by restricting their choice set: some powerholders had only choices A and B available to them, whereas other powerholders had only choices C and B available to them. In addition, half the groups could communicate, whereas the other half could not. Our findings (N = 3690 incentivized decisions) demonstrate that nonbinding communication significantly increases cooperation in hierarchical groups even when powerful group members are constrained to behave selfishly, challenging the notion that actions always speak louder than words.",35.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.04143192079612882,False,triangular cooperation

However, we show that improving the accuracy of numeric estimates does not necessarily improve the accuracy of decisions. For binary-choice judgments, also known as classification tasks — for example, yes/no or build/buy decisions — social influence is most likely to grow the majority vote share, regardless of the accuracy of that opinion. As a result, initially, inaccurate groups become increasingly inaccurate after information exchange, even as they signal stronger support. We term this dynamic the “crowd classification problem.” Using both a novel data set and a reanalysis of three previous data sets, we study this process in two types of information exchange: (1) when people share votes only, and (2) when people form and exchange numeric estimates prior to voting. Surprisingly, when people exchange numeric estimates prior to voting, the binary-choice vote can become less accurate, even as the average numeric estimate becomes more accurate. Our findings recommend against voting as a form of decision making when groups are optimizing for accuracy. For those cases where voting is required, we discuss strategies for managing communication to avoid the crowd classification problem.

Devices are individually traced back to the factory conditions and staffing, down to the assembly line–week, under which they were produced. Despite the manufacturer’s extensive quality control efforts, including stringent testing, each percentage point increase in the weekly rate of workers quitting from an assembly line (its weekly worker turnover) is found to increase field failures by 0.74%–0.79%. In the high-turnover weeks following paydays, eventual field failures are strikingly 10.2% more common than for devices produced during the lowest turnover weeks immediately before paydays. In other weeks, the assembly lines experiencing higher turnover produce an estimated 2%–3% more field failures on average. The associated costs amount to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.

We hypothesized that the binding foundations could predict people’s desire for cultural tightness. We also hypothesized that the perception that one’s society is threatened may drive this effect. Three studies were conducted using both cross-sectional (Studies 1 and 3) and two-wave (Study 2) designs. Demographic variables and participants’ political orientation effects were controlled. In Study 1, only the binding foundations significantly predicted higher desired tightness. In Study 2, binding foundations predicted desired tightness measured at follow-up. In Study 3, the positive effect of perceived threat on desired tightness via the binding foundations was confirmed. From additional within-paper analyses we also have some evidence of significant relationships, albeit unstable across studies, between desired tightness and individualizing foundations.",35.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01148816668981058,False,

A typical approach is to randomize users into a treatment group, which receives the intervention, and a control group, which does not. The platform then compares the performance in the two groups to estimate the effect if the intervention were launched to everyone. We focus on two common experiment types, where the platform randomizes users either on the supply side or on the demand side. For these experiments, it is known that the resulting estimates of the treatment effect are typically biased: individuals in the market compete with each other, which creates interference and leads to a biased estimate. Here, we observe that economic interactions (competition among demand and supply) lead to statistical phenomenon (biased estimates).

We develop a simple, tractable market model to study bias and variance in these experiments with interference. We focus on two choices available to the platform: (1) Which side of the platform should it randomize on (supply or demand)? (2) What proportion of individuals should be allocated to treatment? We find that both choices affect the bias and variance of the resulting estimators, but in different ways. The bias-optimal choice of experiment type depends on the relative amounts of supply and demand in the market, and we discuss how a platform can use market data to select the experiment type. Importantly, we find that in many circumstances choosing the bias-optimal experiment type has little effect on variance, and in some cases coincide with the variance-optimal type. On the other hand, we find that the choice of treatment proportion can induce a bias-variance tradeoff, where the bias-minimizing proportion increases variance. We discuss how a platform can navigate this tradeoff and best choose the proportion, using a combination of modeling as well as contextual knowledge about the market, the risk of the intervention, and reasonable effect sizes of the intervention.",35.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0102423970715513,False,

I compare growth in retail sales between areas with and without local TV service over the unanticipated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Freeze, which halted the licensing of new TV stations from 1948–52. I find three results that corroborate TV’s long-attributed role in American consumerism. First, during the Freeze, total retail sales in counties with TV access increased by 3–4% more on average than in counties without access. Second, the effect of TV was concentrated in the automobile sector, which alone accounted for a third of the total difference. Third, TV advertising led to higher growth in sales, but only for durable goods, which neatly aligns with both qualitative reports and theories of conspicuous consumption. Historians also propose that the suburban family life popularized in TV sitcoms became the mainstream representation of the American Dream in the 1950s.

Indeed, 75% of US employees in a 2021 survey reported a personal preference for working remotely at least one day per week, and studies estimate that 20% of US workdays will take place at home after the pandemic ends. Here we examine how this shift away from in-person interaction affects innovation, which relies on collaborative idea generation as the foundation of commercial and scientific progress. In a laboratory study and a field experiment across five countries (in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia), we show that videoconferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas. By contrast, when it comes to selecting which idea to pursue, we find no evidence that video conferencing groups are less effective (and preliminary evidence that they may be more effective) than in-person groups. Departing from previous theories that focus on how oral and written technologies limit the synchronicity and extent of information exchanged, we find that our effects are driven by differences in the physical nature of videoconferencing and in-person interactions. Specifically, using eye-gaze and recall measures, as well as latent semantic analysis, we demonstrate that videoconferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus.

Objectives: We provide a methodology to forecast the value of a new class of drugs, defined as the incremental value obtained in the scenario in which the new class of drugs is available along with existing drugs compared with the scenario of existing drugs only. We forecasted the value created by direct-acting antiviral drugs to treat chronic hepatitis C in India.

Method: We conducted a physician survey together with an aggregate multinomial logit model to forecast for each patient type the fraction of physicians who would prescribe the new drug under different scenarios. Value was determined by the monetary equivalent of increased life expectancy, reduced disability, and decreased future infection of others, minus drug cost, all treatment-related costs, and the cost of side effects.

Results: We forecasted that the introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs is likely to create USD11.5 billion of value in India over a 5-year period, based on a ‘realistic’ assumption about the growth rate of India’s per capita GDP. Under ‘pessimistic’ and ‘optimistic’ assumptions about the growth rate, the value changes to USD6.5 and 22.5 billion, respectively.

Methods: An online, choice-based conjoint survey was shared with HD community members including untested at-risk individuals, pre-symptomatic mutation carriers, and symptomatic individuals. Across fifteen scenarios, participants chose among two proposed therapies with differing degrees of biomarker improvement and side effects or a third option of no treatment.

Results: 238 responses were received. Attributes reflecting biomarker efficacy (e.g., prevention of brain atrophy on MRI, reduced mutant huntingtin or neurofilament light chain proteins) had 3 to 7-fold greater importance than attributes representing side effects (e.g., increased risk of heart disease, cancer, and stroke over 20 years) and were more influential in directing choice of treatments. Reduction in mutant huntingtin protein was the most valued attribute overall. Multinomial logit model simulations based on survey responses demonstrated high interest among respondents (87-99% of the population) for drugs that might prevent or delay HD solely based upon biomarker evidence, even at the risk of serious side effects.

Conclusion: These results indicate a strong desire among members of the HD community for preventive therapeutics and a willingness to accept significant side effects, even before the drug has been shown to definitively delay disease onset if the drug improves biomarker evidence of HD progression. Preferences of the HD community should inform regulatory policies for approving preventive therapies.",36.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.01406527164058873,False,

In multiparameter Bayesian frameworks, such knowledge is incorporated as a prior. On the other hand, the various model parameters can have different learning rates in real-world problems, especially with skewed data. Two often-faced challenges in operation management and management science applications are the absence of informative priors and the inability to control parameter learning rates. In this study, we propose a hierarchical empirical Bayes approach that addresses both challenges and that can generalize to any Bayesian framework. Our method learns empirical meta-priors from the data itself and uses them to decouple the learning rates of first-order and second-order features (or any other given feature grouping) in a generalized linear model. Because the first-order features are likely to have a more pronounced effect on the outcome, focusing on learning first-order weights first is likely to improve performance and convergence time. Our empirical Bayes method clamps features in each group together and uses the deployed model’s observed data to empirically compute a hierarchical prior in hindsight. We report theoretical results for the unbiasedness, strong consistency, and optimal frequentist cumulative regret properties of our meta-prior variance estimator. We apply our method to a standard supervised learning optimization problem as well as an online combinatorial optimization problem in a contextual bandit setting implemented in an Amazon production system.

Here we examine how differences in the strength of social norms — or tightness-looseness (TL) — across countries can explain the financial performance of cross-border acquisitions (CBAs). We hypothesize that differences in TL hamper CBA performance, and further propose that the direction and absolute level of TL, industry relatedness, and membership in high-tech industries moderate the TL-CBA performance relationship in important ways. Using data for 4,717 CBAs in 30 countries between 1989 and 2013, we find that a one standard deviation increase in TL difference is associated with an average decrease in acquirer’s return on assets equivalent to 245 million US dollars in its net income. We further find that this effect is particularly pronounced when the acquirer is tighter than the target, at greater levels of tightness, and in high-tech industries. Theoretical and practical implications of the strength of social norms for CBAs as well as the broader field of economics are discussed.",36.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.02121346287068851,False,
Trends and Determinants of Retail Prescription Drug Costs,"Ben Teasdale, Amanda Nguyen, Jeroen van Meijgaard, Kevin A.

Data sources: Drug pricing data consisting of US pharmacy claims from 2014 to 2019 collected and licensed by GoodRx, an online tool for comparing drug prices.

Study design: Time trends of median drug prices and coefficients of variation were measured for generic and branded drugs, including subgroups based on clinical condition (i.e., diabetes and cancer). Pharmacy competition was measured using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) at the zip-code level. Multivariable linear regression analysis assessed the impact of local market-level factors on drug prices and variation.

Data collection: US drug pricing data consisting of claims filled through a mix of public and private insurance at 58,332 chain and independent pharmacies across 14,421 zip codes in all 50 states.

Principal findings: From 2014 to 2019, pharmacy retail markets trended towards greater competition: average HHI by zip code decreased by 15.0% (p < 0.001). Median cash price increased significantly for both generic (6.58%, p < 0.001) and branded (84.10%, p < 0.001) drugs. When normalized to acquisition costs, cash prices for generic drugs rose 22.03% (p < 0.001) while those of branded drugs decreased by 2.31% (p < 0.001). Diabetes drugs showed higher baseline overall markup of cash prices relative to acquisition costs (10.54, Interquartile range (IQR) 3.28-18.43) than cancer drugs (1.88, IQR 1.36-3.08). Neither local pharmacy competition nor median income significantly predicted drug price or variation.

Conclusion: Measures of generic drug price and price variation are high despite decreased costs earlier in the pharmaceutical supply chain, defying expectations of what would happen in a competitive market. Efforts to bypass the pharmacy benefit model for generic drugs may offer consumers an opportunity for substantial savings.",36.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01396909245311474,False,
The Spatial Representation of Leadership Depends on Ecological Threat: A Replication and Extension of Menon et al. (2010),"Eftychia Stamkou, Astrid C. Homan, Gerben A. van Kleef, Michele J.

Menon et al., (2010) showed that the use of spatial ordering as cue to leadership differs across cultures: Singaporeans were more likely than Americans to represent leaders behind rather than in front of groups. Furthermore, they showed that threat priming increases the representation of leaders at the back. We replicate and extend these findings. We draw on cultural tightness theory to explain variability in mental representations of leadership, advance the spatial precedence hypothesis that leaders are generally represented in the front, use a large cross-cultural sample to compare different cultural dimensions, and employ alternative operationalizations of threat. We show that leaders are generally represented in frontal spatial positions across 25 countries and in different types of teams. We also find that cultural tightness and ecological threat (pandemic, warfare, and predation) lead people to represent leaders at the back (Studies 1-5). Mediational models show that ecological threat triggers greater desire for tightness and norm-enforcing leaders, which in turn leads people to represent leaders at the back (Study 4). Likewise, in tightly regulated work-teams, leaders are thought of as being seated at the office’s back desk (Study 5). Thus, we converge with Menon et al. that different cultures have different mental representations of leaders and individuals who face threats show greater preference for leaders at the back. Additionally, we demonstrate that cultural tightness is the key cultural predictor of mental representations of leadership.",36.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.0226096591304391,False,

This underrepresentation is at least partly driven by gender stereotypes that associate men, but not women, with achievement-oriented, agentic traits (e.g., assertive and decisive). These stereotypes are expressed and perpetuated in language, with women being described in less agentic terms than men. The present research suggests that appointing women to the top tiers of management can mitigate these deep-rooted stereotypes that are expressed in language. We use natural language processing techniques to analyze over 43,000 documents containing 1.23 billion words, finding that hiring female chief executive officers and board members is associated with changes in organizations’ use of language, such that the semantic meaning of being a woman becomes more similar to the semantic meaning of agency. In other words, hiring women into leadership positions helps to associate women with characteristics that are critical for leadership success. Importantly, our findings suggest that changing organizational language through increasing female representation might provide a path for women to break out of the double bind: when female leaders are appointed into positions of power, women are more strongly associated with the positive aspects of agency (e.g., independent and confident) in language but not at the cost of a reduced association with communality (e.g., kind and caring). Taken together, our findings suggest that female representation is not merely an end, but also a means to systematically change insidious gender stereotypes and overcome the trade-off between women being perceived as either competent or likeable.",37.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.1753425930890825,True,gender bias; gender equity; leadership for women; representation of women; women in politics; women in the workforce; women's leadership; women's representation

To address this research question, they implement a randomized field experiment in Mexico City with 1,148 retailers. The sample is randomized as follows: 385 firms are externally modernized in ways that are visible to customers, 383 firms are internally modernized in ways that are not visible to customers, and 380 firms form a control group. The authors find a significant and persistent main effect of modernization on sales. Firms in both treatment groups increase monthly sales by 15%–19% 24 months after study recruitment. In terms of novel mechanism evidence, externally modernized firms improve their store-level branding, while internally modernized firms strengthen their product management. This article also provides an exploratory analysis to guide policy makers, managerial stakeholders, and retailers on how to modernize for the highest returns. This analysis suggests that it is most useful to modernize a firm’s exterior appearance, customer engagement methods, demand analysis, and stock-ordering processes.

In this paper we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 50% to 90% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions are only 20% to 50% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: a 10% increase in mobility correlates with approximately a 5% increase in the rate of infection. Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city. Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work.

This year, we administered our largest survey to date of 15,000 business owners — 7,500 Latino-owned employer businesses and 7,500 non-Latino, White-owned employer businesses as a benchmark comparison group. The comparative analysis provides a detailed understanding of existing gaps, but also captures encouraging ways in which Latino-owned employer businesses are distinct.

In this report, we explore the financial viability of Latino-owned employer businesses through the multiple characteristics of credit that are commonly used to evaluate borrowers. We have previously reported some significant funding gaps, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to amplify both the need for financing and the understanding of critical levers in the current and future landscape. Moreover, our historical research focus has been on the business outcomes and experiences related to the Latino entrepreneur, but this report also looks inward into the employment opportunities within Latino-owned businesses. Thus, our current research focuses exclusively on employer firms, those with at least one paid employee other than the owner, as these businesses are poised to have great impact on the economy and job creation. The findings in this report are also considered in the context of broader national trends as we weight our sample to be as nationally representative as possible; additional methodological information related to sampling and measures can be found in Appendix A. We include a glossary of terms to support readers in Appendix B.

In addition to our focus on the kinds of jobs created by Latinos, which we operationalize through novel indices, this report continues the work we undertook last year in measuring the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The broader context of the pandemic continues to permeate businesses on a global scale. We report on the strategies deployed to mitigate challenges and consider the impact of the $800 billion small business relief aid distributed through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). We also feature five case studies with Latino entrepreneurs, former participants of the SLEI-Education Scaling program, that speak directly to themes uncovered in the national survey.

The 2021 State of Latino Entrepreneurship report provides organizations focused on supporting businesses (e.g., chambers of commerce, trade associations, economic development associations, etc.), think tanks, governmental policymakers, and corporations with insights into the business outcomes of Latino-owned businesses to inform data-driven policy and programs.

Do differences in these contributions partially explain disparities in academic career outcomes? We explore this by looking at how gender is embodied in research language, and then ascertain whether the adoption of more gendered research language affects career outcomes beyond the researcher’s attributes. We identify different forms of gendered knowledge — gender referents (explicit references to sex and gender) and gender-associated terms (words that are implicitly associated with women or men researchers) — by applying natural language processing techniques to nearly one million doctoral dissertations published in the United States between 1980 and 2010. We then determine whether employing gender referents and gender-associated terms affects the course of PhDs’ ensuing careers. We find women researchers have lower chances of securing academic positions than men in every field; explicit references to women as research subjects are modestly rewarded in comparison to references to men; and more career opportunities are afforded to research knowledge associated with men. These results suggest that academia is slowly correcting the traditional and explicit bias of studying men at the exclusion of women. Still, there remains a stronger implicit bias against knowledge associated with women scholars.

Observers attributed less moral conviction following prosocial behavior when they believed an organization was losing (vs. gaining) economic resources (Studies 1 and 2). This effect was primarily a “penalty” assessed against organizations that were losing resources, as opposed to a “reward” given to organizations gaining resources (Study 3). Finally, we found that this effect occurred because people perceive organizations that are losing resources as more situationally constrained, leading them to attribute less dispositional moral conviction (Study 4).

In addition, while brokers are required to consider odd lot quotes as part of their duty of best execution, odd lot quotes are formally excluded from the calculation of the national best bid and offer. This Article, written for a symposium on the Future of Securities Regulation at Columbia Law School, examines whether these regulatory exclusions for odd lot trades and quotes increase trade execution costs for retail trades filled in non-exchange venues. Across more than 3 billion trades during 2020, odd lot trades filled in non-exchange venues received ten percent less price improvement than non-odd lot trades. In addition, using order book data from Nasdaq, examination of a sample of retail, non-exchange trades in two popular retail stocks — Amazon and GameStop — on January 27, 2021 reveals that thirty-one to forty-six percent of odd lot trades would have received better pricing had the venue filled the order at the Nasdaq odd lot quote.

Despite this, we show that the new entrant is less likely to disrupt an incumbent than the incumbent is to disrupt itself, and less likely to fail in the market. We extend the model to allow the incumbent to acquire the entrant postinnovation and show that this reverses the Arrow effect.

Three experiments (total N = 893) that used incentivized economic games found support for this hypothesis. Designating intergroup conflict as the default option significantly increased individual participation in conflict relative to a no-default condition and to designating other behavioral options as defaults. The effects of defaults on intergroup conflict generalized across different social identities and levels of group identification.

We study the performance gain one may achieve when leveraging such auxiliary data, and the design of algorithm that effectively do so without prior information on the underlying information arrival process. We introduce a generalized formulation, which considers a broad class of distributions that are informative about rewards from actions, and allows observations from these distributions to arrive according to an arbitrary and a priori unknown process. When it is known how to map auxiliary data to reward estimates, we obtain matching bounds that characterize the best achievable performance as a function of the information arrival process. In terms of achieving optimal performance, we establish that upper confidence bound and Thompson sampling policies possess natural robustness with respect to the information arrival process, which uncovers a novel property of these popular algorithms and further lends credence to their appeal. When the mappings connecting auxiliary data and rewards are a unknown, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition under which auxiliary information allows performance improvement, and devise a new policy that is near-optimal in that setting.

Prior to this task, we exposed respondents to primes about:

Though we observed no significant differences in the behavior of Democrats as a result of priming, we found that Republicans — and particularly those with very strong conservative views — were significantly less likely to learn from Democrats when primed about a common enemy. Because our study was in the field during the 2020 Iran Crisis, we were able to further evaluate this finding via a natural experiment — Republicans who participated in our study after the crisis were even less influenced by the beliefs of Democrats than those Republicans who participated before this event. These findings indicate common enemies may not reduce inter-group conflict in highly polarized societies, and contribute to a growing number of studies that find evidence of asymmetric political polarization in the United States.

However, computers are extraordinarily persistent, particularly for routine, repetitive work. This potentially reduces the value of human persistence in occupations that are computerized. Using a well-defined measure of worker persistence across a nationally-representative 16-year sample of 4,239 individuals, we investigate the extent to which occupations value worker persistence in the presence of computers. We find that the labor market does indeed value persistence. Nonetheless, we find that in routine jobs, the wage premium of human persistence diminishes with the degree of workplace computerization. Yet, this substitution does not occur in non-routine jobs.

We find that tax cuts lead to higher income for both top and bottom earners, but the gains to capital income for top earners exceed the gains to total income for bottom earners.

This can be done with a simple top-down recursive partitioning algorithm, starting with a single community and separating the nodes into two communities by spectral clustering repeatedly, until a stopping rule suggests there are no further communities. This class of algorithms is model-free, computationally efficient, and requires no tuning other than selecting a stopping rule. We show that there are regimes where this approach outperforms K-way spectral clustering, and propose a natural framework for analyzing the algorithm’s theoretical performance, the binary tree stochastic block model. Under this model, we prove that the algorithm correctly recovers the entire community tree under relatively mild assumptions. We apply the algorithm to a gene network based on gene co-occurrence in 1580 research papers on anemia, and identify six clusters of genes in a meaningful hierarchy.

We consider a buyer who repeatedly demands a certain good and is unable to commit to long-term contracts. In each time period, the buyer makes a price offer to a seller who has private, persistent information regarding his cost and quality of provision. If the offer is accepted, the seller provides the good with a stochastic quality that is not contractible; otherwise, the buyer sources the good from a known outside option. The buyer can therefore learn from the (strategic) acceptance decisions taken by the seller, and from evaluations of the (stochastic) quality delivered whenever a purchase occurs. Hence, the buyer not only faces a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, but also needs to decide how to explore: by facilitating quality observations, or by strategically separating seller types. We characterize the Perfect Bayesian Equilibria of this sequential interaction and show that the buyer’s equilibrium strategy consists of a dynamic sequence of thresholds on her belief on the seller’s type. In equilibrium, the buyer offers high prices that incentivize trade and quality experimentation at early stages of the interaction and, after gathering enough information (and if her belief is sufficiently low), she advances to offering low prices that may partially separate seller types. Contrasting the buyer’s strategy with two benchmark strategies designed to learn from each form of information in isolation, we identify the effect that strategic sellers may have on the buyer’s optimal strategy relative to more traditional learning dynamics, and establish that, paradoxically, when sellers are strategic, the ability to observe delivered quality is not always beneficial for the buyer.",40.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01316923736452849,False,

Previous studies have focused on deriving minimax-optimal algorithms in cases where it is a priori known how smooth the payoff functions are. In practice, however, the smoothness of payoff functions is typically not known in advance, and misspecification of smoothness may severely deteriorate the performance of existing methods. In this work, we consider a framework where the smoothness of payoff functions is not known, and study when and how algorithms may adapt to unknown smoothness. First, we establish that designing algorithms that adapt to unknown smoothness of payoff functions is, in general, impossible.

It is unclear what this implies for the health of democracy without knowing whether candidates who look more electable or competent in photos behave more competently in office. This study brings novel performance data to this question and shows that voters can identify which politicians divert less public money and communicate more persuasively based solely on headshots. Such inferences do not predict politicians’ effort visiting their constituencies, but neither do other available metrics like professional qualifications. I implement these studies in a low-income country where ballots include candidate photos and where weak institutional checks raise the stakes for selecting innately competent leaders.

To maximize the number of realized matches between the two sides (referred to herein as customers and suppliers), the platform must balance the inherent tension between recommending more suppliers to customers to increase the chances that they like one of them and avoiding the conflicts that arise when customers, who are given more options, end up choosing the same suppliers. We introduce a stylized model to study the above tradeoff. The platform offers each customer a menu of suppliers, and customers choose, simultaneously and independently, to either select a supplier from their menu or remain unmatched. Suppliers then see the set of customers that have selected them and choose to either match with one of these customers or remain unmatched. A match occurs if a customer and a supplier choose each other (in sequence). Agents’ choices are probabilistic and proportional to the public scores of agents in their menu and a score that is associated with the outside option of remaining unmatched. The platform’s problem is to construct menus for customers, so as to maximize the total number of matches. We first show that this problem is strongly NP-hard. Then, we provide an intuitive efficient algorithm that achieves a constant-factor approximation to the optimal expected number of matches. Our algorithm uses bucketing (grouping similar suppliers into buckets) together with linear-programming-based relaxations and rounding techniques.",40.0,School Website,100,Goal 11,0.003042329761127822,False,

The consumer’s utility is additive in the different categories. Her preferences about product attributes as well as her price sensitivity vary across products and may be correlated across products. We build on techniques from the machine learning literature on probabilistic models of matrix factorization, extending the methods to account for time-varying product attributes and products going out-of-stock. We evaluate the performance of the model using held-out data from weeks with price changes or out of stock products. We show that our model improves over traditional modeling approaches that consider each category in isolation. One source of the improvement is the ability of the model to accurately estimate heterogeneity in preferences (by pooling information across categories); another source of improvement is its ability to estimate the preferences of consumers who have rarely or never made a purchase in a given category in the training data. Using held-out data, we show that our model can accurately distinguish which consumers are most price sensitive to a given product.

When employees can use their own discretion, which may be influenced by personal preferences, to select a supplier, the incentives of the employees and the organization may be misaligned. Disclosing information about previous purchasing decisions made by other employees can reduce or exacerbate this misalignment, as peer effects may come into play. To understand the effects of transparency, we introduce a theoretical model that compares employees’ actions in two settings: one where employees cannot observe each other’s choices and one where they can observe the decision previously made by a peer before making their own. Two behavioral assumptions are central to our model: that employees are heterogeneous in their reciprocity toward their employer, and that they experience peer effects in the form of income inequality aversion toward their peer. As a result, our model predicts the existence of negative spillovers as a reciprocal employee is more likely to choose the expensive supplier (which gives the employee a personal reward) when the employee observes that a peer did so. A laboratory experiment confirms the existence of negative spillovers and the main behavioral mechanisms described in our model. A surprising result not predicted by our theory is that employees whose decisions are observed by their peers are less likely to choose the expensive supplier than the employees in the no-transparency case.

BDES concludes that a key benefit of mandatory auditor reporting to bank regulators is reduced bank risk, and its costs include reduced profitability from less overall and less risky lending, and higher audit costs. BDES also provides evidence on the channels through which mandatory auditor reporting links to reduced bank risk. We scrutinize BDES’s analyses and inferences and suggest additional analyses to improve and deepen them. Most notably, we caution that effective bank regulation entails reducing risk for riskier banks; risk reduction for safer banks suggests regulatory overreach. Our evidence is more indicative of regulatory overreach. Thus, although BDES is an important step forward in understanding the role auditors can and do play in improving information available to key decision-makers other than through auditor reports on financial statements and internal controls, a comprehensive assessment of whether the benefits of mandatory auditor reporting to bank regulators exceed its costs is left for future research. Such an assessment is necessary before concluding whether mandatory auditor reporting leads to more effective bank regulation or regulatory overreach.",41.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01054879056019672,False,financial market regulation

Our approach enables us to accurately estimate the effect of small changes to system parameters by combining unobtrusive randomization with light-weight modeling, all while remaining in equilibrium. We can then use these estimates to optimize the system by gradient descent. Concretely, we focus on the problem of a platform that seeks to optimize supply-side payments p in a centralized marketplace where different suppliers interact via their effects on the overall supply-demand equilibrium, and show that our approach enables the platform to optimize p based on perturbations whose magnitude can get vanishingly small in large systems.",41.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.04860977966068371,False,

We argue that the characteristics of the Big Two (e.g., agency/competence, communion/warmth) are reflections of psychological notions of masculinity and femininity that render gender the basis of the fundamental lens through which one sees the social world. Thus, although past work has identified the Big Two as a model to understand social categories, we argue that gender itself is the social category that explains the nature of the Big Two. We outline support for this theory and suggest implications of a gendered cognition in which gender not only provides functional utility for cognitive processing but simultaneously enforces gender roles and limits men and women’s opportunities. Recognizing that the Big Two reflect masculinity and femininity does not confine people to act in accordance with their gender but rather allows for novel interventions to reduce gender-based inequities.",42.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.1312499204034835,True,gender and technology; gender bias; gender discrimination; gender equality; gender equity; gender inequality; gender norms; gender parity; gender-focused policies; gender-sensitive policies

In the experimental control group, clinicians who were asked to independently reflect on the standardized patient videos did not show any significant reduction in bias.

Vehicle Maintenance Contracting in Developing Economies: The Role of Social Enterprise,"Li Chen, Sang-Hyun Kim, Hau L.

Difficulties in healthcare delivery in developing economies arise from poor road infrastructure of rural communities, where the bulk of the population resides. Although motorcycles are an effective means for delivering healthcare products, governments in developing economies lack expertise in proper maintenance, resulting in frequent vehicle breakdowns. Riders for Health, a nonprofit social enterprise (SE), has developed specialized capabilities that enable significant enhancements in vehicle maintenance. Riders for Health has engaged with the governments and provided its services using different contracting approaches. However, the effect of such practice on improving vehicle availability — the main social mission of Riders for Health — is not well understood.

Academic/Practical Relevance

This paper presents one of the first rigorous analyses of how SEs achieve their goals through innovations in operations. Our analysis highlights the relationship between a social mission objective and a service contract choice, contrasting it with the choice by a profit-maximizing organization traditionally assumed in the service contracting literature in operations management.

Methodology

We construct and analyze a stylized model that combines the elements of reliability theory and contract theory, explicitly accounting for the SE’s social mission in her objective function.

Results

We find that the “total solution” approach of providing all aspects of vehicle maintenance, including fleet ownership, is a preferred choice for an SE that prioritizes improving vehicle availability; by contrast, an organization that focuses on profit maximization would find this approach less attractive. Moreover, we show that the total solution approach induces the SE to exert more efforts on failure prevention and repair lead time reduction in equilibrium. Our analysis also suggests that the SE could further improve vehicle availability by the total solution approach if it manages a large fleet that consists of vehicles with high resale values. Managerial implications: Our findings provide theoretical support for Riders for Health’s recent move toward the total solution approach as it expands its service into wider rural areas in many countries. The insights obtained from our analysis offer actionable guidelines to other SEs operating in developing economies.",42.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.05796417982923508,True,health infrastructure

The opposition can attempt to block the executive action in the courts, and the higher the probability of success the weaker the threat is. The theory predicts that bargains are stuck, but during the divided government years of the Obama and Trump administrations no major legislation was enacted. Bargaining failure is explained in the theory by ideological hatred resulting from increased polarization in Congress and by party competition for the electoral prize of unified government.

Additionally, none of the studies found an interaction of racial demographic shift and ethnic identification in which racial demographic shift increased Trump support among high-identifying Whites. We conclude by discussing a variety of potential explanations for our findings, including (a) that racial status threats did not increase Whites’ Trump support, (b) that racial status threats increased Trump support early in the 2016 election cycle, but the role of this factor in Trump support declined over time, or (c) that this pattern is an example of a broader tendency of declining experimental treatment effects on candidate support over time in campaigns.",42.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01032962702869464,False,

For randomized experiments with ignorable compliance and general observational studies obeying the strong ignorability assumption, the intervals satisfy a doubly robust property which states the following: the average coverage is approximately controlled if either the propensity score or the conditional quantiles of potential outcomes can be estimated accurately.

In unbalanced markets, the platform should force the short side of the market to initiate contact with potential partners, by disallowing the long side from doing so. This allows the agents on the long side to exercise more choice in equilibrium.

Purpose

We designed this study to identify how health care organizations can facilitate collaborative development of ML-based CDS tools to enhance their value for health care delivery in real-world settings.

Methodology/Approach

We utilized qualitative methods, including 37 interviews in a large, multispecialty health system that developed and implemented two operational ML-based CDS tools in two of its hospital sites. We performed thematic analyses to inform presentation of an explanatory framework and recommendations.

Results

We found that ML-based CDS tool development and implementation into clinical workflows proceeded in four phases: iterative solution coidentification, iterative coengagement, iterative coapplication, and iterative corefinement. Each phase is characterized by a collaborative back-and-forth process between the technology’s developers and users, through which both users’ activities and the technology itself are transformed.

Conclusion

Health care organizations that anticipate iterative collaboration to be an integral aspect of their ML-based CDS tools’ development and implementation process may have more success in deploying ML-based CDS tools that assist end users in their work than organizations that expect a traditional technology innovation process.

Practice implications: Managers developing and implementing ML-based CDS tools should frame the work as a collaborative learning opportunity for both users and the technology itself and should solicit constructive feedback from users on potential changes to the technology, in addition to potential changes to user workflows, in an ongoing, iterative manner.",43.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.05932055984406159,True,health systems

I introduce two imperfect firm‐performance measures, cash flows and accounting earnings, into a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms under imperfect information. The model demonstrates that improvements in measurement systems lead to more informed decisions on the part of firms and ultimately to allocation of greater resources to high‐productivity firms via the product and input markets. Estimated parameter values are consistent with accrual accounting improving managers’ information about current productivity by providing a better measure of historical firm performance. Quantitative analysis suggests that introducing accrual‐accounting information on top of cash‐accounting information leads to a 0.5% increase in aggregate U.S. productivity and a 0.7% increase in aggregate U.S. output via improved resource allocation. The corresponding estimates for China and India, as benchmarks for developing countries, are larger: a 1.5% to 2.3% increase in aggregate productivity and a 2.3% to 3.4% increase in aggregate output.

Interracial relationships blur the boundaries between racial groups, challenging the essentialized racial categories that define Whiteness as an exclusive, high status identity. Whites, who are the most resistant to interracial marriage of any racial group, have used their dominant position in American society to enforce norms against interracial relationships. Despite the importance of racial homogamy to White identity and status, we argue that gender roles make violating norms against intimate intergroup contact more costly for women than men, leading to Whites’ greater resistance to interracial relationships involving White women. In a representative American sample using a natural quasi-experiment, as well as three follow-up lab experiments, we find that White women face differential social penalties for intimate intergroup contact — being perceived as gender deviant and low status within the group. By contrast, having a racial out-group partner did not influence status perceptions of men or Black women. Status perceptions of both individuals in the couple predicted attitudes toward the couple as a unit, leading to greater prejudice toward interracial relationships involving White women than White men. This research demonstrates the existence of a gendered double standard for intimate intergroup contact among Whites, revealing that gender norms play a critical role in the maintenance of American racial boundaries.",43.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.1148815758023463,True,gender norms

Between March and October of 2020, loans worth $2 trillion entered forbearance. On average, cumulative payments missed per individual in forbearance during this period were largest for mortgage ($3,200) and auto ($430) borrowers. We estimate that more than 60 million borrowers will miss $70 billion on their debt payments by the end of 2021:Q1. This large amount of debt relief significantly dampened the household debt distress, which can help explain household delinquencies below pre-pandemic levels — a significant difference from other economic crises when delinquencies sharply increased along with unemployment. Forbearance thus may have had potentially large aggregate consequences for house prices and economic activity. Relief flows more to higher income individuals than those receiving stimulus checks, partially due to their higher debt balances: 60% of aggregate forbearance is provided to above median income borrowers. On the other hand, forbearance rates are higher among the more vulnerable populations: individuals with lower credit scores and lower incomes. Borrowers in regions with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 related economic shocks and higher shares of minorities were more likely to obtain debt relief. One third of borrowers in forbearance continued making full payments, suggesting that forbearance acts as a credit line, allowing borrowers to “draw” on payment deferral if needed. More than a quarter of total debt relief was provided by the private sector outside of the government mandates. Exploiting a discontinuity in mortgage eligibility under the CARES Act we estimate that implicit government debt relief subsidies increase the rate of forbearance by about 25%. Government and private relief follow similar patterns across income and creditworthiness, suggesting that borrower self-selection in requesting forbearance is an important determinant of debt relief incidence, and drives the distribution of relief across different population strata. Government relief is provided through private intermediaries, which differ in their propensity to supply relief, with shadow banks less likely to provide forbearance than traditional banks.",43.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.05913872081709753,True,debt distress; debt relief

(2) Can we find traces of evolutionary change in character complexity? (3) Is complexity distributed in a way that makes character recognition easier?

Our study suggests that (1) character complexity depends primarily on which linguistic unit the characters encode, and that (2) there is little evidence of evolutionary change in character complexity.

To address this participation gap, we identify psychological ownership of government benefits as a factor that significantly influences individuals’ interest in applying for government benefits. Psychological ownership refers to how much an individual feels that a target is their own. We propose that the more individuals feel that government benefits are their own, the less likely they are to perceive applying for them as an aversive ask for help, and thus, the more likely they are to pursue them. Three large-scale field experiments among low-income individuals demonstrate that higher psychological ownership framing of government benefits significantly increases participants’ pursuit of benefits and outperforms other common psychological interventions. An additional experiment shows that this effect occurs because greater psychological ownership reduces people’s general aversion to asking for assistance. Relative to control messages, these psychological ownership interventions increased interest in claiming government benefits by 20% to 128%. These results suggest that psychological ownership framing is an effective tool in the portfolio of potential behavioral science interventions and a simple way to stimulate interest in claiming benefits.",43.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01372029759068468,False,financial assistance

For which employees does stock-option financing make sense?
Is the growth of this industry driven by large increases in private company valuations, or would it continue in the absence of these forces?
Why haven’t more traditional lenders entered the market? Would more competition drive down lending rates and the returns these vendors enjoy?

How do these innovations affect moral hazard and service quality? We investigate this problem by comparing driver routing choices and efficiency on a large digital platform, Uber, with traditional taxis. The identification is enabled by matching taxi and Uber trips at the origin-destination-time level so they are subject to the same underlying optimal route, by exploiting characteristics of the pricing schemes that differentially affect the incentives of taxi and Uber drivers in various circumstances, and by examining changes in behavior when drivers switch from taxis to Uber. We find that (1) taxi drivers route longer in distance than matched Uber drivers on metered airport routes by an average of 8%, with nonlocal passengers on airport routes experiencing even longer routing; (2) no such long routing is found for short trips in dense markets (e.g., within-Manhattan trips) or airport trips with a flat fare; and (3) long routing in general leads to longer travel time, instead of saving passengers time. These findings are consistent with digital platform designs reducing driver moral hazard, but not with competing explanations such as driver selection or differences in driver navigation technologies.

However, “serialized late handoffs” — wherein implementers were handed relatively mature ideas after an earlier handoff between two other individuals — were less costly to creativity than late handoffs from one other individual.

A randomized controlled trial generally provides the most credible evaluation of a treatment, but the efficiency and effectiveness of the trial depend on the existing evidence supporting the treatment. The researcher must therefore compile a body of evidence justifying the use of time and resources to further investigate a treatment hypothesis in a trial. An observational study can provide this evidence, but the lack of randomized exposure and the researcher’s inability to control treatment administration and data collection introduce significant challenges. A proper analysis of observational health care data thus requires contributions from experts in a diverse set of topics ranging from epidemiology and causal analysis to relevant medical specialties and data sources.

These frustrations may contribute to burnout.

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate and quantify health care workers’ frustration with technology and its relationship with emotional exhaustion, after controlling for measures of work-life integration that may indicate excessive job demands.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional, observational study of health care workers across 31 Michigan hospitals. We used the Safety, Communication, Operational Reliability, and Engagement (SCORE) survey to measure work-life integration and emotional exhaustion among the survey respondents. We used mixed-effects hierarchical linear regression to evaluate the relationship among frustration with technology, other components of work-life integration, and emotional exhaustion, with adjustment for unit and health care worker characteristics.

Results: Of 15,505 respondents, 5065 (32.7%) reported that they experienced frustration with technology on at least 3-5 days per week. Frustration with technology was associated with higher scores for the composite Emotional Exhaustion scale (r=0.35, P<.001) and each individual item on the Emotional Exhaustion scale (r=0.29-0.36, P<.001 for all). Each 10-point increase in the frustration with technology score was associated with a 1.2-point increase (95% CI 1.1-1.4) in emotional exhaustion (both measured on 100-point scales), after adjustment for other work-life integration items and unit and health care worker characteristics.

Conclusions: This study found that frustration with technology and several other markers of work-life integration are independently associated with emotional exhaustion among health care workers. Frustration with technology is common but not ubiquitous among health care workers, and it is one of several work-life integration factors associated with emotional exhaustion. Minimizing frustration with health care technology may be an effective approach in reducing burnout among health care workers.",44.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.09184038452989843,True,health workforce

In a previous analysis, the U.S. National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM) showed that a growth mindset could improve the grades of lower-achieving adolescents, and, in an exploratory analysis, increase enrollment in advanced math courses across achievement levels. Yet, the importance of being a “learner” in today’s global economy requires clarification and replication of potential challenge-seeking effects, as well as an investigation of the school affordances that make intervention effects on challenge-seeking possible. To this end, the present article presents new analyses of the U.S. NSLM (N = 14,472) to (a) validate a standardized, behavioral measure of challenge-seeking (the “make-a-math worksheet” task), and (b) show that the growth mindset treatment increased challenge-seeking on this task. Second, a new experiment conducted with nearly all schools in 2 counties in Norway, the U-say experiment (N = 6,541), replicated the effects of the growth mindset intervention on the behavioral challenge-seeking task and on increased advanced math course-enrollment rates. Treated students took (and subsequently passed) advanced math at a higher rate. Critically, the U-say experiment provided the first direct evidence that a structural factor—school policies governing when and how students opt in to advanced math — can afford students the possibility of profiting from a growth mindset intervention or not. These results highlight the importance of motivational research that goes beyond grades or performance alone and focuses on challenge-seeking.

The DM does not observe the state except for a limited number of monitoring times, which he must choose, in conjunction with a suitable stopping policy, to maximize his reward. Dealing with these types of stopping problems, which arise in a variety of applications from healthcare to finance, often requires excessive amounts of data for calibration purposes and prohibitive computational resources. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust optimization approach, whereby adaptive uncertainty sets capture the information acquired through monitoring. We consider two versions of the problem — static and dynamic — depending on how the monitoring times are chosen. We show that, under certain conditions, the same worst-case reward is achievable under either static or dynamic monitoring.

The planner seeks a mechanism that maximizes agents’ total utilities, subject to incentive and market-clearing constraints. We uncover the constrained Pareto frontier by identifying the optimal trade-off between allocative efficiency and redistribution. We find that competitive-equilibrium allocation is not always optimal. Instead, when there is inequality across sides of the market, the optimal design uses a tax-like mechanism, introducing a wedge between the buyer and seller prices, and redistributing the resulting surplus to the poorer side of the market via lump-sum payments. When there is significant same-side inequality that can be uncovered by market behavior, it may be optimal to impose price controls even though doing so induces rationing.",45.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.09980965749674667,True,financial market regulation

Here, we show that the classical measure of path length fails to define network connectedness and node centrality for complex contagions. Centrality measures and seeding strategies based on the classical definition of path length frequently misidentify the network features that are most effective for spreading complex contagions. To address these issues, we derive measures of complex path length and complex centrality, which significantly improve the capacity to identify the network structures and central individuals best suited for spreading complex contagions.

For decades this question has been central to research on organizations, and two leading theories have answered the question very differently. Neo-institutional theory points to the importance of mimetic isomorphism, where organizations imitate one another as they navigate decisions in the context of uncertainty over what is regarded as legitimate action. By contrast, ecological theory argues that competitive exclusion explains the differences we see around us, as organizations repel one another when they vie for the same resources. Decades of empirical work have tended to confirm one or the other prediction, with little acknowledgement of their opposition. Furthermore, much of the existing empirical work is limited to descriptive studies that make little or no attempt to empirically identify their findings, leaving the empirical record open to concerns over endogeneity. This article conducts an identified empirical test in a context where the two arguments make opposing predictions. In an analysis of auditor selection after the collapse of Arthur Andersen, we find evidence of competitive exclusion but no evidence of mimetic isomorphism.

The power can be further enhanced by solving a secondary nonlinear travelling salesman problem, for which the genetic algorithm can find a reasonably good solution.

In parallel, there was a push in academia to develop courses enabling interdisciplinary problem solving and more holistic, practice-oriented education. In response, Stanford Biodesign created a graduate course in biomedical technology innovation. Seventeen years later, we sought to gauge the impact of this course on student commitment to careers in biomedical technology, whether students took on leadership and innovation roles, and if they found the holistic innovation process we teach to be useful in their careers. We disseminated a web-based survey to collect self-reported data from students completing the course between 2003 and 2019. 186 students responded (24.8%). 62% (n = 115/186) reported a strong commitment to careers in biomedical technology before the course while 84% (n = 156/186) felt that way after.

Bringing More Value to Small Farmers: A Study of Potato Farmers in Pakistan,"Syed Zahoor Hassan, Muhammad Shakeel Sadiq Jajja, Muhammad Asif, George Foster",Management Decision,2021,Management Decision May182021 Vol. 59 Issue 4 Pages 829–857.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/bringing-more-value-small-farmers-study-potato-farmers-pakistan,"Purpose: Small farmers, being the primary producers of crops, are the key players in the food supply chain. Yet, they remain the most marginalized in the value chain. The marginalization of small farmers can affect food sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to identify opportunities for bringing more value to small farmers in an agricultural value chain.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper makes use of action research, studying the potato value chain, in a developing agricultural country Pakistan. The authors conducted an in-depth study of 37 farmers in four regions, each being a large potato growing ecosystem. The study examined the end-to-end decision-making processes, sources of input (both physical and information), cultivation and sales practices, cost structure, productivity and profitability of the farmers in potato farming.

Findings: Large variations exist in the crop yield, cost structure and profitability of farmers within each of and among the four regions due to differences in cultivation practices and approach to sales. There is a significant potential to lower costs, increase yield and enhance overall profitability by using the existing better processes. By addressing the issues faced by small farmers their profits can be potentially doubled. The paper also discusses potential means of recrafting and streamlining the value chain to bring more value to small farmers.

Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a detailed account of how different interventions can increase the value for small farmers. Since the current food supply chain and sustainability are under stress, worldwide, the findings of this study have implications for farmers as well as policy makers.

Originality/value: The literature on streamlining the agricultural value chain and enhancing the share of small farmers is scarce. Improving the value chain and reducing the marginalization of small farmers is an essential step toward increasing food sustainability.",46.0,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.1432172596832414,True,agricultural practices; agricultural productivity; agricultural research; agriculture investment; food commodity markets; food production; food scarcity; food value chains; local farmers; resilient agriculture; small-scale food producers; sustainable agriculture

This leads to a matrix that well-approximates the original (incomplete) matrix, but has lower complexity according to the nuclear norm for matrices. We generalize results from the matrix completion literature by allowing the patterns of missing data to have a time series dependency structure that is common in social science applications. We present novel insights concerning the connections between the matrix completion literature, the literature on interactive fixed effects models and the literatures on program evaluation under unconfoundedness and synthetic control methods. We show that all these estimators can be viewed as focusing on the same objective function. They differ solely in the way they deal with identification, in some cases solely through regularization (our proposed nuclear norm matrix completion estimator) and in other cases primarily through imposing hard restrictions (the unconfoundedness and synthetic control approaches).

Buyers and sellers are divided into types, and we represent the compatibility between different types using a bipartite network. Traders are heterogeneous in terms of their valuations, and different types have possibly different value distributions. Buyers may have additional value for trading with some seller types. The platform chooses commissions/subscriptions to maximize its revenues.

Academic/practical relevance: Two salient features of most online platforms are that they do not dictate the transaction prices, and they use commissions/subscriptions for extracting revenues. We shed light on how these commissions/subscriptions should be set in networked markets.

Methodology: Using tools from convex optimization and combinatorial optimization, we obtain tractable methods for computing the optimal commissions/subscriptions and provide insights into the platform’s revenues, buyer/seller surplus, and welfare.

Results: We provide a tractable convex optimization formulation to obtain the revenue-maximizing commissions/subscriptions, and establish that, typically, different types should be charged different commissions/subscriptions depending on their network positions. We establish that the latter result holds even when the traders on each side have identical value distributions, and in this setting we provide lower and upper bounds on the platform’s revenues in terms of the supply-demand imbalance across the network. Motivated by simpler schemes used in practice, we show that the revenue loss can be unbounded when all traders on the same side are charged the same commissions/subscriptions, and bound the revenue loss in terms of the supply-demand imbalance across the network. Charging only buyers or only sellers leads to at least half of the optimal revenues, when different types on the same side can be charged differently.

One strategy employed to promote this approach is to portray humans as machines. Five studies (and three replication and follow-up studies) using different human-as-machine stimuli (internal body composition, face, appearance, and physical movement) revealed divergent effects of human-as-machine representations. While these stimuli promoted healthier choices among consumers who were high in eating self-efficacy, they backfired among consumers who were low in eating self-efficacy (measured in Studies 1 and 3–5; manipulated in Study 2). This reversal happened because portraying humans as machines activated consumers’ expectation of adopting a cognitive, machine-like approach to food (Studies 3 and 4) — an expectation that was too difficult to meet for those with low (vs. high) eating self-efficacy. We tested a solution to accompany human-as-machine stimuli in the field (Study 5): Externally enhancing how easy and doable it was for consumers low in eating self-efficacy to meet the expectation of adopting a cognitive approach to food, which effectively attenuated the backfire effect on their lunch choices at a cafeteria.",47.0,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.08309377458503128,True,moderate food insecurity

We consider the problem faced by a procurement agency that runs a mechanism for constructing an assortment of differentiated products with posted prices, from which heterogeneous consumers buy their most preferred alternative. Procurement mechanisms used by large organizations, including framework agreements (FAs), which are widely used in the public sector, often take this form. When choosing the assortment, the procurement agency must optimize the tradeoff between offering a richer menu of products for consumers and offering less variety, hoping to engage the suppliers in more aggressive price competition. We formulate the problem faced by the procurement agency as a mechanism design problem, and we progressively incorporate more complex and often more realistic implementation constraints, including that the allocations should be decentralized (that is, consumers choose what to buy) and that payments must be implemented through linear pricing (in particular, no up-front payments are allowed). We characterize the optimal buying mechanisms that highlight the importance of restricting the entry of close-substitute products to the assortment as a way to increase price competition without much damage to variety. Motivated by the implementation of the Chilean FAs, which are being used to acquire around US$3 billion in goods and services per year, we leverage our characterization of the optimal mechanism to study the design of first-price-auction-type mechanisms that are commonly used in public settings.

For example, it is now well known that the sample mean is biased in adaptive trials. Inferential challenges are exacerbated when our parameter of interest differs from the parameter the trial was designed to target, such as when we are interested in estimating the value of a sub-optimal treatment after running a trial to determine the optimal treatment using a stochastic bandit design. In this context, typical estimators that use inverse propensity weighting to eliminate sampling bias can be problematic: their distributions become skewed and heavy-tailed as the propensity scores decay to zero.



In this paper, we present a class of estimators that overcome these issues. Our approach is to adaptively reweight the terms of an augmented inverse propensity weighting estimator to control the contribution of each term to the estimator’s variance. This adaptive weighting scheme prevents estimates from becoming heavy-tailed, ensuring asymptotically correct coverage. It also reduces variance, allowing us to test hypotheses with greater power — especially hypotheses that were not targeted by the experimental design. We validate the accuracy of the resulting estimates and their confidence intervals in numerical experiments, and show our methods compare favorably to existing alternatives in terms of RMSE and coverage.",47.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.008262944828687406,False,

We find that some CEOs voluntarily purchase shares despite the cost of foregone diversification — and, sometimes outright unprofitability — to indirectly benefit by prolonging their tenure.

In particular, greedy algorithms that exploit current estimates without any exploration may be suboptimal in general. However, exploration-free greedy algorithms are desirable in practical settings where exploration may be costly or unethical (e.g., clinical trials). Surprisingly, we find that a simple greedy algorithm can be rate optimal (achieves asymptotically optimal regret) if there is sufficient randomness in the observed contexts (covariates). We prove that this is always the case for a two-armed bandit under a general class of context distributions that satisfy a condition we term covariate diversity. Furthermore, even absent this condition, we show that a greedy algorithm can be rate optimal with positive probability. Thus, standard bandit algorithms may unnecessarily explore. Motivated by these results, we introduce Greedy-First, a new algorithm that uses only observed contexts and rewards to determine whether to follow a greedy algorithm or to explore. We prove that this algorithm is rate optimal without any additional assumptions on the context distribution or the number of arms. Extensive simulations demonstrate that Greedy-First successfully reduces exploration and outperforms existing (exploration-based) contextual bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling or upper confidence bound.

Based on a Western independent model of motivation, passionate individuals-those who have a strong interest, demonstrate deep enjoyment, and express confidence in what they are doing-are considered future achievers. Those with less passion are thought to have less potential and are often passed over for admission or employment. As academic institutions and corporations in the increasingly multicultural world seek to acquire talent from across the globe, can they assume that passion is an equally strong predictor of achievement across cultural contexts? We address this question with three representative samples totaling 1.2 million students in 59 societies and provide empirical evidence of a systematic, cross-cultural variation in the importance of passion in predicting achievement. In individualistic societies where independent models of motivation are prevalent, relative to collectivistic societies where interdependent models of motivation are more common, passion predicts a larger gain (0.32 vs. 0.21 SD) and explains more variance in achievement (37% vs. 16%). In contrast, in collectivistic societies, parental support predicts achievement over and above passion. These findings suggest that in addition to passion, achievement may be fueled by striving to realize connectedness and meet family expectations.

We contribute to the existing literature by investigating not only the policy maker’s role in encouraging innovation but also the role of consumer preferences and learning-by-doing benefits of new production methods. Our setting features producers with access to traditional and innovative production methods and consumers that have a higher valuation for the output of the innovative method. We develop a model to analyze producers’ decisions of whether to experiment with a new production method when facing uncertainty about their production yield as well as the benefits associated with learning-by-doing. Our findings indicate that using only taxes encourages experimentation with new production methods but decreases social welfare. Utilizing only subsidies outperforms policies that involve both taxes and subsidies in achieving higher social welfare but the converse is true in achieving a higher experimentation rate. We show that zero-expenditure policies result in a decline in social welfare unless producers face financial barriers when making the costly transition to new methods. The insights we generate can help policy makers design policies to achieve specific objectives, e.g., target experimentation/adoption rates. We illustrate their applicability by conducting a numerical study using data on conventional and organic egg production in Denmark. The study generates concrete policy recommendations to achieve the organic production goal set by the Danish government.",48.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.04689899429981743,False,subsidy reform; sustainable agriculture

We develop an “advantage doubly robust” estimator for learning such dynamic treatment rules using observational data under the assumption of sequential ignorability.

Audit fees decline and audit hours increase after mandatory rotation, but then reverse over the tenure cycle. We also find evidence that audit firms use “shadowing” in preparation for a lead partner turnover. These effects differ by competitiveness of the local audit market, client size, and partner experience. When multiple members of the audit team commence work at a new client, the transition appears to be more disruptive and more likely to exhibit audit quality effects.

This paper develops a generic, time-driven life-cycle cost model for mobility services to address two closely related questions central to the emergence of clean energy transportation services: (i) the utilization rates (hours of operation) that determine how alternative drivetrains rank in terms of their cost, and (ii) the cost-efficient share of clean energy drivetrains in a vehicle fleet composed of competing drivetrains. The model compares alternative drivetrains with different environmental and economic characteristics in terms of their life-cycle cost for any given duty cycle. The critical utilization rate that equates any two drivetrains in terms of their life-cycle cost is shown to also provide the optimization criterion for the efficient mix of vehicles in a fleet. This model framework is then calibrated in the context of urban transit buses, on the basis of actual cost- and operational data for an entire bus fleet. In particular, our analysis highlights how the economic comparison between diesel and battery-electric transit buses depends on the specifics of the duty cycle (route) to be served. While electric buses entail substantially higher upfront acquisition costs, the results show that they obtain lower life-cycle costs once utilization rates exceed only 20% of the annual hours, even for less favorable duty cycles. At the same time, the current economics of the service profile examined in our study still calls for the overall fleet to have a one-third share of diesel drivetrains.",49.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.1042035398655412,True,energy for transportation

Achieving widespread immunization 1 month faster would thus save many lives and mitigate short- and long-run economic harm. Although the value of vaccines may seem obvious, government action and investment in vaccines have not been commensurate with the enormous scale of benefits, with many countries not likely to achieve widespread immunization until the end of 2022.

We estimate below that installed capacity for 3 billion annual vaccine courses has a global benefit of $17.4 trillion, over $5800 per course. Investing now in expanding capacity for an additional annual 1 billion courses could accelerate completion of widespread immunization by over 4 months, providing additional global benefits of $576 to $989 per course. This dwarfs prices of $6 to $40 per course seen in deals with vaccine producers, indicating the wide gap between social and commercial incentives. We urge governments and international organizations to contract with vaccine producers to further expand capacity and encourage measures described below to “stretch” existing capacity (such as lower-dose regimens) and efficiently allocate courses (such as a cross-country vaccine exchange).

Our analysis involves two exercises, first estimating the global benefits from vaccine capacity already in place, then estimating the benefits of undertaking additional capacity investment starting now (see supplementary materials for all data and methods). The enormous estimates from both exercises provide a wake-up call relevant for the current pandemic—that it is not too late to invest in more capacity—and future pandemics—that preparations to shorten delays in rolling out vaccines, treatments, and other countermeasures at global scale could prevent enormous harm.",49.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0527679222098719,True,statistical capacity building

Little is known regarding global variation in patterns of use. Objective: To provide insights into which EHR activities clinicians spend their time doing, the EHR tools they use, the system messages they receive, and the amount of time they spend using the EHR after hours. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed the de-identified metadata of ambulatory care health systems in the US, Canada, Northern Europe, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania from January 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. All of these organizations used the EHR software from Epic Systems and represented most of Epic Systems’s ambulatory customer base. The sample included all clinicians with scheduled patient appointments, such as physicians and advanced practice practitioners. Exposures: Clinician EHR use was tracked by de-identified and aggregated metadata across a variety of clinical activities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics for clinician EHR use included time spent on clinical activities, note documentation (as measured by the percentage of characters in the note generated by automated or manual data entry source), messages received, and time spent after hours. Results: A total of 371 health systems were included in the sample, of which 348 (93.8%) were located in the US and 23 (6.2%) were located in other countries. US clinicians spent more time per day actively using the EHR compared with non-US clinicians (mean time, 90.2 minutes vs 59.1 minutes; P <.001). In addition, US clinicians vs non-US clinicians spent significantly more time performing 4 clinical activities: notes (40.7 minutes vs 30.7 minutes; P <.001), orders (19.5 minutes vs 8.75 minutes; P <.001), in-basket messages (12.5 minutes vs 4.80 minutes; P <.001), and clinical review (17.6 minutes vs 14.8 minutes; P =.01). Clinicians in the US composed more automated note text than their non-US counterparts (77.5% vs 60.8% of note text; P <.001) and received statistically significantly more messages per day (33.8 vs 12.8; P <.001). Furthermore, US clinicians used the EHR for a longer time after hours, logging in 26.5 minutes per day vs 19.5 minutes per day for non-US clinicians (P =.01). The median US clinician spent as much time actively using the EHR per day (90.1 minutes) as a non-US clinician in the 99th percentile of active EHR use time per day (90.7 minutes) in the sample. These results persisted after controlling for organizational characteristics, including structure, type, size, and daily patient volume. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that US clinicians compared with their non-US counterparts spent substantially more time actively using the EHR for a wide range of clinical activities or tasks. This finding suggests that US clinicians have a greater EHR burden that may be associated with nontechnical factors, which policy makers and health system leaders should consider when addressing clinician wellness.",49.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.03943223803048211,False,

An entrant chooses a product quality in the middle of the quality gap, and its quality is decreasing in the marginal product design cost. Instead of a top dog strategy that makes it a tougher post entry competitor, an incumbent firm uses a smart dog strategy of offering an additional product to forestall entry by narrowing the quality gap. Forestalling entry reduces profit relative to no threat of entry, but the incentive to innovate is preserved by applying an innovation success to the innovator’s entire product line. Growth thus is due to new product introduction and innovation by incumbents rather than to creative destruction by entrants.

Following the crash, the average investor turned more pessimistic about the short-run performance of both the stock market and the real economy. Investors also perceived higher probabilities of both further extreme stock market declines and large declines in short-run real economic activity. In contrast, investor expectations about long-run (10-y) economic and stock market outcomes remained largely unchanged, and, if anything, improved. Disagreement among investors about economic and stock market outcomes also increased substantially following the stock market crash, with the disagreement persisting through the partial market recovery.

Better to Give Than Reciprocate? Status and Reciprocity in Prosocial Exchange,"Francis J.

However, we find that reciprocity does not generate equal benefits, in terms of social status. Instead, across 7 studies (N = 3,426), observers conferred more status to individuals who initiated (i.e., initiators) than individuals who reciprocated (i.e., reciprocators) identical prosocial acts. Further, choosing not to reciprocate a prosocial act led to a more severe status penalty than choosing not to initiate a prosocial act. We find this discounting of reciprocity is driven by perceived obligation — observers view reciprocators as acting under constraint. When reciprocation appears less obligatory (e.g., given indirectly, or privately), the status discount is mitigated. Finally, we show that the discounting of a reciprocal act can be enduring — reciprocators still received less status after 2 successive, counterbalanced rounds of exchange.",50.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.00996278777466292,False,

In this study, we consider two adoption cases of 3D printing in a dual-channel (i.e., online and in-store) retail setting, and evaluate its impact on a firm’s product offering, pricing, and inventory decisions. Our analysis uncovers the following effects of 3D printing. First, 3D printing at the factory has the substitution effect of technological innovation for online demands, as 3D printing replaces the traditional mode of production. Such technology substitution not only leads to increased product variety offered online, which allows the firm to charge a price premium for online customers, but also induces the firm to offer a smaller product variety and a reduced price in-store. There is an additional environmental benefit when more customers are steered from the in-store channel to the online channel. Second, when 3D printing is used in-store as well, in addition to the substitution effect, the firm also achieves a structural effect due to the fundamental change in the supply chain structure. Since the in-store demand is served in a build-to-order fashion, the firm achieves postponement benefits in inventory management. The environmental benefit is the most significant in this case. Moreover, using 3D printing in-store will require a new supplier–retailer relationship. We find that cost-sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chains where 3D printing is used in-store and the supplier controls the raw material inventory.",50.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.02346831113279225,False,environmental impact; environmental protection; environmentally friendly consumption

This year, we administered our national survey amid a global pandemic and vast social unrest, and the unique disruptions businesses faced over the past year are clearly visible in the survey responses.

This report highlights the impact of Latino-owned employer businesses in the U.S. economy and compares their experiences to those of White-owned employer firms in the United States. This year, we not only surveyed U.S. Latino business owners but also a comparison group of White business owners to identify similarities and differences in their experiences. We collected a sample of 3,500 White-owned businesses and 3,500+ Latino-owned businesses. Additionally, we captured time-series data from a smaller cohort of Latino-owned firms over the months of March, June, and September 2020, to capture the progressive impact of the pandemic on Latino-owned businesses.

Our current research focuses on employer firms, those with at least one paid employee other than the owner, as these businesses are poised to have the greatest impact on the economy and job creation. This focus on employer firms aligns with the approach taken by the U.S. Census Bureau in their Annual Business Survey, which we rely on for statistical purposes to make our sample as nationally representative as possible.

The 2020 State of Latino Entrepreneurship report provides organizations focused on supporting businesses (e.g., chambers of commerce, trade associations, economic development associations, etc.), think tanks, policymakers, and corporations with insights into the business outcomes of Latino-owned businesses to inform data-driven policy and programs. Additionally, we hope Latino business owners leverage these data to inform their business decision-making and operations.

An Achievable-Region-Based Approach for Kidney Allocation Policy Design with Endogenous Patient Choice,"Baris Ata, Yichuan Ding, Stefanos Zenios",Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,2021,Manufacturing & Service Operations Management January2021 Vol. 23 Issue 1 Pages 36–54.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/achievable-region-based-approach-kidney-allocation-policy-design,"Problem definition: Deceased-donor kidney transplant candidates in the United States are ranked according to characteristics of both the donor and the recipient. We seek the ranking policy that optimizes the efficiency–equity tradeoff among all such policies, taking into account patients’ strategic choices. 

Academic/practical relevance: Our approach considers a broad class of ranking policies, which provides approximations to the previously and currently used policies in practice. It also subsumes other policies proposed in the literature previously. As such, it facilitates a unified way of characterizing good policies. 

Methodology: We use a fluid model to approximate the transplant waitlist. Modeling patients as rational decision makers, we compute the resulting equilibria under a broad class of ranking policies, namely the achievable region. We then develop an algorithm that optimizes the system performance over the achievable region. 

Results: We show analytically that it suffices to restrict attention to priority scores that are affine in the patient’s waiting time. We also show through a numerical study that the total quality-adjusted life-years can be increased substantially by allowing patient rankings to depend on the kidney quality. Last, we observe that there is almost no improvement if only the healthier patients are prioritized for certain kidney types. 

Managerial implications: Our results verify that ranking patients differently for kidneys of different quality can reduce the survival mismatch and the kidney wastage significantly. Consequently, the policy change in 2014, that implemented prioritizing the healthiest patients when allocating the highest 20% quality organs, is a step in the right direction. For further improvement, one may consider revising the new policy by also prioritizing the least healthy patients on the waitlist for the lowest-quality organs.",50.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.02333398102167229,False,

Yet, anthropological data indicates that large, independent societies consistently arrive at highly similar category systems across a range of topics. How is it possible for diverse populations, consisting of individuals with significant variation in how they categorize the world, to independently construct similar category systems? Here, we investigate this puzzle experimentally by creating an online “Grouping Game” in which we observe how people in small and large populations collaboratively construct category systems for a continuum of ambiguous stimuli. We find that solitary individuals and small groups produce highly divergent category systems; however, across independent trials with unique participants, large populations consistently converge on highly similar category systems. A formal model of critical mass dynamics in social networks accurately predicts this process of scale-induced category convergence.

In our 20-month comparative field study of medical assistants and patient-service representatives learning to use new digital technology in five primary care sites, we find that the traditional master-apprentice training model worked well when established practices were being conferred to trainees. When environmental change required introducing new tools and techniques with which the experienced members had no expertise, third-party managers selected newer members as trainers because managers judged them to be agile learners who were less committed to traditional hierarchies and more willing to deviate from traditional norms. This challenged community members’ existing status, which was based on the historical distinctions of long tenure and expertise in traditional tasks. In three sites, the introduction of this illegitimate learning hierarchy sparked status competition among trainees and trainers, and trainees collectively resisted learning new tools and techniques. In the other two sites, managers paired the new, illegitimate learning hierarchy with the opportunity for trainee status mobility by rotating the trainer role; here, trainees embraced learning in order to exit the lower-status trainee group and join the higher-status trainer group.

By contrast, when people adopt extreme solutions for resolving these exact same trade-offs, they exhibit highlighting, consistency seeking, and compromise avoidance, respectively. Our review of the choice literature first illustrates how many seemingly unrelated phenomena actually share the same underlying psychology. We then identify variables that promote one solution versus the other. These variables, in turn, systematically influence which of opposite choice effects arise (e.g., highlighting versus balancing).

However, when the reward model is not well-specified, the bandit algorithm may incur unexpected regret, so recent work has focused on algorithms that are robust to misspecification. We propose a simple family of contextual bandit algorithms that adapt to misspecification error by reverting to a good safe policy when there is evidence that misspecification is causing a regret increase. Our algorithm requires only an offline regression oracle to ensure regret guarantees that gracefully degrade in terms of a measure of the average misspecification level. Compared to prior work, we attain similar regret guarantees, but we do not rely on a master algorithm, and do not require more robust oracles like online or constrained regression oracles (e.g., Foster et al.

Algorithmic Discrimination and Input Accountability under the Civil Rights Acts,"Robert P.

These concerns are being expressed through Congressional subpoenas, regulatory investigations, and an increasing number of algorithmic accountability bills pending in both state legislatures and Congress. To date, however, prominent efforts to define algorithmic accountability have tended to focus on output-oriented policies that may facilitate illegitimate discrimination or involve fairness corrections unlikely to be legally valid. Worse still, other approaches focus merely on a model’s predictive accuracy—an approach at odds with long-standing U.S. anti-discrimination law.



We provide a workable definition of algorithmic accountability that is rooted in case law addressing statistical discrimination in the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Using instruction from the burden-shifting framework codified to implement Title VII, we formulate a simple statistical test to apply to the design and review of the inputs used in any algorithmic decision-making process. Application of the test, which we label the Input Accountability Test, constitutes a legally viable, deployable tool that can prevent an algorithmic model from systematically penalizing members of protected groups who are otherwise qualified in a legitimate target characteristic of interest.",51.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.0527265624648923,True,LGBTQ+ discrimination; age discrimination; disability discrimination; discrimination; discriminatory laws; discriminatory policies; discriminatory practices; eliminating discrimination; racial inequality

For targets, we examine the range of actions and structures of various entities that have been empirically associated with authenticity.  For audiences, we explore variations in interests in authenticity based on domain engagement, cosmopolitanism, and cross-cultural differences.  For third parties, we consider the roles of other audience members, certifiers and regulators.

What factors affect whether individuals choose to share? This research identifies a novel determinant of attitude sharing—support-oppose framing, defined as whether individuals think of their own attitude in terms of what they support or what they oppose. Support-oppose framing is distinct from attitude valence, as the same attitude can be framed in terms of support (e.g., I support that this policy is bad) or opposition (e.g., I oppose that this policy is good). Seven experiments, two correlational studies, and one field study provide evidence for a support-oppose framing effect, whereby individuals are more likely to share, or express, attitudes framed in terms of positions they support rather than positions they oppose. This effect occurs via two pathways. In the first, support-framed attitudes are viewed as more value expressive, which facilitates greater attitude sharing. In the second, support-framed attitudes are believed to promote more positive impressions, which also leads to greater sharing. This effect is attenuated when individuals’ typical impression-management goals are relaxed.",51.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.014006888408997,False,

Additionally, we found significant effects of average contextual diversity, valence, animacy, and concreteness on list-level recall.

We suggest that lay theory intervention effects depend on psychological affordances, which are defined as cues that allow individuals to view a lay theory as legitimate and adaptive in that context. The present research directly and experimentally tested this hypothesis using the example of a “purpose for learning” lay theory intervention, which taught the lay theory that school is a place to develop skills that allow one to make progress toward self-transcendent aims. A double-blind 2 (student purpose intervention) × 2 (purpose-affording note) field experiment was conducted in a relatively low-performing public middle school in the United States. Students first received a web-based purpose for learning lay theory intervention (or a control activity), and 2 weeks later attended a class in which an assignment was accompanied by a purpose-affording note that was hand-written by a teacher (or a control note). Results showed that the purpose lay theory intervention increased performance on an English class writing assignment, but only when it was accompanied by a purpose-affording note. Exploratory analyses revealed that the effects of the manipulations were apparent among students who were at greater risk for poor performance in the class: nonnative English-speaking students. Thus short, online lay theory interventions may reduce performance gaps, provided that the contexts afford the opportunity for the proffered lay theory to seem legitimate and adaptive.",51.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.01659379393580369,False,

This has gone as far as some journals banning the use of indicators for statistical significance, or even any reports of p-values, and, in one case, any mention of confidence intervals. I discuss three of the issues that have led to these often-heated debates. First, I argue that in many cases, p-values and indicators of statistical significance do not answer the questions of primary interest. Such questions typically involve making (recommendations on) decisions under uncertainty. In that case, point estimates and measures of uncertainty in the form of confidence intervals or even better, Bayesian intervals, are often more informative summary statistics. In fact, in that case, the presence or absence of statistical significance is essentially irrelevant, and including them in the discussion may confuse the matter at hand. Second, I argue that there are also cases where testing null hypotheses is a natural goal and where p-values are reasonable and appropriate summary statistics. I conclude that banning them in general is counterproductive. Third, I discuss that the overemphasis in empirical work on statistical significance has led to abuse of p-values in the form of p-hacking and publication bias. The use of pre-analysis plans and replication studies, in combination with lowering the emphasis on statistical significance may help address these problems.",51.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01882371301026626,False,

The juxtaposition of commonality and harm seemingly challenges assumptions about performance-enhancing organizational adaptations and begs the obvious question of why and how psychologically toxic individuals can rise to and remain in powerful positions. I argue that labels applied to leaders implying darkness or dysfunction divert attention in unproductive ways from the benefits of these traits and bias research findings. I present arguments as to why many people readily choose what research suggests are psychologically problematic people to follow. Fixing the many leadership crises besetting modern societies requires more attention to why people rise to positions of power and, more controversially, teaching people to embrace, rather than shun, behaviors and tactics that actually create power and career success.

We find that the gender gap in negotiation outcomes exists only when female negotiators have a strong outside option. Furthermore, our large data set allows us to examine an understudied performance outcome, rate of impasse. We find that negotiations in which at least one negotiator is a woman with a strong alternative disproportionately end in impasse, a performance outcome that leaves considerable potential value unallocated. In addition, we find that these gender differences in negotiation performance are not due to gender differences in aspirations, reservation values, or first offers. Overall, these findings are consistent with a backlash account, whereby counterparts are less likely to come to an agreement and therefore reach a potentially worse outcome when one party is a female negotiator empowered by a strong alternative.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.1126485949370999,True,gender wage gap

These allocations can also critically influence the service providers’ well-being, and thus the planning systems are often concerned with ensuring that their allocations satisfy particular desirable attributes. In some cases, such guarantees may induce a loss in the total value created or in the system’s share of that value. We provide a broad framework that allows quantifying the magnitude of such value losses due to provider guarantees. We consider a general class of guarantees that includes many considerations of practical interest arising in the design of sustainable two-sided markets, workforce welfare and compensation, sourcing and payments in supply chains, among other application domains. We derive tight bounds on the relative value loss, and show that this loss is limited for any restriction included in our general class. Our analysis shows that when many providers are present, the largest losses are driven by fairness considerations; but when few providers are present, the main loss driver is the heterogeneity in the providers’ ability to generate value. We study additional loss drivers such as the variation in the value of jobs and the supply-demand balance, and find that these can influence the loss in a non-intuitive fashion, with less variability in value and a more balanced supply-demand ratio leading to larger losses. Lastly, we demonstrate numerically using both real-world and synthetic data that the relative loss can be very small in several cases of practical interest.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.04543777574691557,False,

Invisibility makes privilege powerful. Especially when it remains unexposed, privilege perpetuates inequity by giving unearned advantages to certain groups over others. However, recent social movements (e.g., Occupy) attempt to expose class-based privilege, threatening its invisibility. Across eight experiments, we show that beneficiaries of class privilege respond to such exposure by increasing their claims of personal hardships and hard work, to cover privilege in a veneer of meritocracy. Experiments 1a–c show that when people are provided evidence of their own class privilege, they claim to have suffered more personal life hardships. Experiment 2 suggests that these claims are driven in part by threats to self-regard. Experiment 3 finds that such self-defense is motivated specifically by a desire to attribute positive outcomes to the self (i.e., sense of personal merit). When given the chance to first bolster their sense of personal merit, those benefiting from privilege no longer claim hardships in response to evidence of privilege. Experiments 4 and 5 further suggest self-concerns are at play: only self-relevant privilege evokes defensive responses, and self-affirmation reduces hardship claims more than does system-affirmation. Finally, Experiment 6 suggests that people claim hardships because they believe these imply personal merit on their part. Preventing the privileged from claiming hardship leads them to claim increased effort in the workplace and to increase effort on a difficult task. Overall, results suggest that even when those benefiting from class privileges are confronted with evidence of their “invisible knapsack,” ideologies of personal merit help them cover the privileges of class once again.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.01118996454061776,False,disadvantaged groups; self-worth
Caseload Is Increased by Resequencing Cases Before and on the Day of Surgery at Ambulatory Surgery Centers Where Initial Patient Recovery Is in Operating Rooms and Cleanup Times Are Longer Than Typical,"Zhengli Wang, Franklin Dexter, Stefanos Zenios",Journal of Clinical Anesthesia,2020,Journal of Clinical Anesthesia December2020 Vol. 67,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/caseload-increased-resequencing-cases-day-surgery-ambulatory-surgery,"Study Objective

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacts operating room management in regions with high prevalence (e.g., >1.0% of asymptomatic patients testing positive). Cases with aerosol-producing procedures are isolated to a few ORs, initial phase I recovery of those patients is in the ORs, and multimodal environmental decontamination applied. We quantified the potential increase in productivity from also resequencing these cases among those two or three ORs.

Design

Computer simulation provided sample sizes requiring >100 years experimentally. Resequencing was limited to changes in the start times of surgeons’ lists of cases.

Setting

Ambulatory surgery center or hospital outpatient department.

Main Results

With case resequencing applied before and on the day of surgery, there were 5.6% and 5.5% more cases per OR per day for the two ORs and three ORs, respectively, both standard errors (SE) < 0.1%. Resequencing cases among ORs to start cases earlier permitted increases in the hours into which cases could be scheduled from 10.5 to 11.0 h, while assuring >90% probability of each OR finishing within the prespecified 12-h shift. Thus, the additional cases were all scheduled before the day of surgery. The greater allocated time also resulted in less overutilized time, a mean of 4.2 min per OR per day for two ORs (SE 0.5) and 6.3 min per OR per day for three ORs (SE 0.4). The benefit could be achieved while limiting application of resequencing to days when the OR with the fewest estimated hours of cases has ≤8 h.

Conclusions

Some ambulatory surgery ORs have unusually long OR times and/or room cleanup times (e.g., infection control efforts because of the pandemic). Resequencing cases before and on the day of surgery should be considered, because moving one or two cases occasionally has little to no cost with substantive benefit.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01500282751941256,False,COVID-19 impact; disease outbreaks

To examine occupational heritability in medicine and changes in heritability over time, with Swedish population wide administrative data that allowed mapping family trees of physicians spanning up to three generations.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting 

Individual level administrative registry data from Sweden.

Participants 

Physicians born in 1950-90 and living in Sweden at some time during 2001-16 (n=47 400).

Main outcome measures 

The proportion of individuals with a completed medical degree with at least one parent who also trained in medicine, and the change in this proportion across birth cohorts. Additional analyses were conducted among other relatives (grandparents, aunts and uncles, and siblings) and for individuals with a law degree.

Results 

For 27,788 physicians, where the educational background for both parents was known, 14% had a parent who was also a physician and 2% had two parents who were physicians. The proportion of physicians with at least one physician parent increased significantly over time, from 6% for physicians born in 1950-59 to 20% for physicians born in 1980-90 (P<0.001). The same pattern of increasing occupational heritability was not seen for individuals with law degrees.

Conclusions 

In recent cohorts of physicians in Sweden, one in five had a parent who was also a physician, more than triple the proportion seen for physicians born three decades earlier. A similar pattern was not seen in lawyers, suggesting that increasing occupational heritability in medicine does not reflect intergenerational persistence of high paying degrees alone. Rather, for physicians in Sweden, medicine might increasingly run in families.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.004243579074928382,False,

Prior work shows managers play a key role, but researchers have been unable to observe the thought processes guiding managers’ evaluations. This article takes a first step in examining managers’ sense-making as they interpret and evaluate employee behaviors. Our data include managers’ written performance reviews and numeric ratings of employees at a Fortune 500 technology company. Our theoretical model — the Viewing and Valuing Social Cognitive Processing Model — explains how and when gender beliefs frame managers’ evaluations, affecting what behaviors managers notice (i.e., view) and rate highly (i.e., value). After conducting a detailed coding of the language in reviews, we assess whether there are gender differences in (1) the language used to describe performance (i.e., viewing differences) and (2) the correlations between that language and numeric ratings (i.e., valuing differences). Our analysis of 88 language attributes reveals where gender frames managers’ evaluations and where the process instead operates gender-neutrally. For example, men and women are equally likely to be described as having technical ability, while women are viewed as too aggressive and men as too soft. Furthermore, some behaviors, such as “taking charge,” are more valued for men than for women: “taking charge” is associated with the highest performance ratings for men but not for women. Overall, our analysis identifies novel ways that gender biases emerge in a process intended to be meritocratic.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.136471488193409,True,gender bias; gender discrimination; gender disparities; gender equality; gender equity; gender norms; gender-focused policies; gender-sensitive budgeting; gender-sensitive policies

Even when the platform’s aggregate levels of supply and demand remain fixed, we establish that the platform’s ability to use its design levers to manage the availability of supply over time yields significant value. We study two such levers, each using the platform’s availability of supply as a means to incentivize participation from buyers who decide strategically when/how often to participate. First, the platform’s listing policy sets the ending times of incoming auctions (hence, the frequency of market clearing). Exploiting a natural experiment, we illustrate that consolidating auctions’ ending times to certain weekdays increases the platform’s revenues by 7.3% mainly by inducing a higher level of bidder participation. The second lever is a recommendation system that can be used to reveal information about real-time market thickness to potential bidders. The optimization of these levers highlights a novel trade-off. Namely, when the platform consolidates auctions’ ending times, more bidders may participate in the marketplace (demand-side competition); but ultimately auctions for substitutable goods cannibalize one another (supply-side competition). To optimize these design decisions, we estimate a structural model that endogenizes bidders’ dynamic behavior, that is, their decisions on whether/how often to participate in the marketplace and how much to bid. We find that appropriately designing a recommendation system yields an additional revenue increase (on top of the benefits obtained by optimizing the platform’s listing policy) by reducing supply-side cannibalization and altering the composition of participating bidders.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.009645799742397185,False,

The environmental impacts of wind turbines have emerged as a dominant consideration in the planning process in order to increase public acceptance, protect the surrounding environment and to conserve pristine ecosystems. Hence, ensuring holistic planning and community participation are key factors if wind-generated electricity is to be expanded. Existing macro-planning methods lack quantifiable models for assessing wind turbines’ full environmental implications. The current study uses a holistic and quantitative methodology to identify suitable sites for wind turbines in the north of Israel using available GIS software. By evaluating a broad range of local environmental and spatial conditions, the research improves on existing GIS modeling. The spatial criteria that affect zoning optimization are then applied using a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The results indicate that 0.5% of possible sites in the study area are suitable for wind turbine development according to the strictest environmental constraints. Anthropocentric environmental impacts from turbines were found to be significant whenever sites were located less than 750m from settlements. Ecological impacts, however, were not found to be correlated with the distance from natural protected areas.

In this study we argue that the gender pay gap begins when women and men with earned degrees enter the workforce. Further, we contend the gender pay gap may arise due to cultural beliefs about the appropriateness of women and men for STEM professions that shape individuals’ self-beliefs in the form of self-efficacy. Using a three-wave NSF-funded longitudinal survey of 559 engineering and computer science students that graduated from over two dozen institutions in the United States between 2015 and 2017, we find women earn less than men, net of human capital factors like engineering degree and grade point average, and that the influence of gender on starting salaries is associated with self-efficacy. We find no support for a competing hypothesis that the importance placed on pay explains the pay gap; there is no gender difference in reported importance placed on pay. We also find no support for the idea that women earn less because they place more importance on workplace culture; women do value workplace culture more, but those who hold such values earn more rather than less. Overall, the results suggest that addressing cultural beliefs as manifested in self-beliefs — that is, the confidence gap — commands attention to reduce the gender pay gap.",52.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.1752604093382539,True,equal pay; gender bias; gender equity; gender inequality; gender wage gap; women in the workforce

Reasonable setback distances and attention to avian populations also appear necessary to assuage public opinion. Evaluation of demographic characteristics reveals disparate preferences in different populations.

Results from correlation (Study 3) and moderation (Study 4) approaches suggest this preference stems from the assumption that lower-ranking team members are more attentive to and aware of the descriptive social norms of their team.

The framework involves a stochastic processing network (SPN) scheduling problem in which the scheduler may access the system state only through a noisy channel, and resource allocation decisions must be carried out through the interaction between an encoding policy (that observes the state) and allocation policy (that chooses the allocation). Applications in the management of large-scale data centers and human-in-the-loop service systems are among our chief motivations. We quantify the degree to which information constraints reduce the size of the capacity region in general SPNs and how such reduction depends on the amount of memories available to the encoding and allocation policies. Using a novel metric, capacity factor, our main theorem characterizes the reduction in capacity region (under “optimal” policies) for all nondegenerate channels and across almost all combinations of memory sizes. Notably, the theorem demonstrates, in substantial generality, that (1) the presence of a noisy channel always reduces capacity, (2) more memory for the allocation policy always improves capacity, and (3) more memory for the encoding policy has little to no effect on capacity. Finally, all of our positive (achievability) results are established through constructive, implementable policies. Our proof program involves the development of a host of new techniques, largely from first principles, by combining ideas from information theory, learning and queuing theory. As a submodule of one of the policies proposed, we create a simple yet powerful generalization of the maximum-weight (max-weight) policy, in which individual Markov chains are selected dynamically, in a manner analogous to how schedules are used in a conventional max-weight policy.",53.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.04429402742990825,False,

In Study 1, employees who used reappraisal to control guilt and shame were more satisfied and less burnt out, but also more likely to engage in CWBs.

Here we test the claim that extreme protest actions — protest behaviors perceived to be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both — typically reduce support for social movements. Across 6 experiments, including 3 that were preregistered, participants indicated less support for social movements that used more extreme protest actions. This result obtained across a variety of movements (e.g., animal rights, anti-Trump, anti-abortion) and extreme protest actions (e.g., blocking highways, vandalizing property). Further, in 5 of 6 studies, negative reactions to extreme protest actions also led participants to support the movement’s central cause less, and these effects were largely independent of individuals’ prior ideology or views on the issue. In all studies we found effects were driven by diminished social identification with the movement. In Studies 4–6, serial mediation analyses detailed a more in-depth model: observers viewed extreme protest actions to be immoral, reducing observers’ emotional connection to the movement and, in turn, reducing identification with and support for the movement. Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist’s dilemma, in which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also likely to undermine popular support for social movements.",53.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.02777418532225741,False,

We argue, however, that contagious disease cues can also elicit fear.

Across four experiments and two large empirical data analyses of the presence of contagious disease on actual consumption behavior, we find that cues of contagious disease increase both fear and disgust, and these emotions together form a unique behavioral tendency with respect to consumer behavior. Relative to either emotion alone, disgust and fear increase preference for more familiar products asymmetrically over less familiar ones. These results contribute theoretically to research on complex emotional states and the behavioral tendencies of emotions, document a systematic and consequential impact of contagious disease cues on real consumption behavior, and have significant practical implications for marketers.",54.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.02177006486332657,False,communicable diseases

Although corporate income taxes play an important role for manufacturing firms, these firms also remit a large share of their tax payments through the value-added tax system, through the excise tax system, and through payroll taxes. Gross receipts taxes play an important role for firms in other industries, leading to spillovers that may affect the overall economy. Second, we evaluate whether the structure of China’s tax revenue matches its stage of development. A cross-country comparison of sources of government revenue shows that China collects a high share of tax revenue from taxes on goods and services and a high share of income tax on corporations. Finally, we study whether firm-level differences in effective tax rates can be an important source of allocative inefficiencies. Decomposing the variation in effective tax rates across firms, we find that government policies, including loss carry-forward provisions and preferential policies for regional, foreign, small, and high-tech firms, have significant explanatory power.

Across an extensive simulation study, we show that no single method systematically outperforms others. We find, however, that doubly robust modifications of standard methods for average treatment effect estimation with missing data repeatedly perform better than their nondoubly robust baselines; for example, doubly robust generalized propensity score methods beat inverse-weighting with the generalized propensity score. This finding is reinforced in an analysis of an observational study on the effect on mortality of tranexamic acid administration among patients with traumatic brain injury in the context of critical care management.

Grade Inflation in Restaurant Hygiene Inspections: Repeated Interactions Between Inspectors and Restaurateurs,"Balázs Kovács, David Lehman, Glenn R.

We investigate the impact of an administrative design feature found in many schemes: repeated interactions between health inspectors and restaurateurs. Data was analyzed from 336,208 inspections of 27,119 restaurants conducted by 493 inspectors from 2000 to 2010 by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health. The findings associate repeated interactions with higher public letter grades, and these grades drop with the assignment of a new inspector. Specifically, a one-unit increase in the logged number of visits by a prior inspector is associated with a 71% increased chance the restaurant will be downgraded to a lower letter grade upon the arrival of a new inspector. Exploiting an inspection protocol change in 2007, we also find that inspectors with more repeated visits to a restaurant are more likely to code a higher number of compliant rules as “Not Observed,” thereby possibly avoiding potential violations and corresponding penalties. Analysis of subsequent consumer complaints filed with the local health department shows that a one-unit increase in repeated inspector-restaurateur interactions is associated with an 10% increase in the likelihood of a consumer complaint, suggesting a public health impact. Coupled with prior evidence, the study demonstrates that administrative and design features of targeted transparency policies can impact the information provided to the public and potentially affect health outcomes.",54.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.07979847735389986,True,public health

Because of nonrivalry, there may be large social gains to data being used broadly across firms, even in the presence of privacy considerations. Fearing creative destruction, firms may choose to hoard data they own, leading to the inefficient use of nonrival data.

In this Closer Look, we examine the CEO compensation decisions of large publicly traded companies in the U.S. following the spread of COVID-19 to see how many elected to modify CEO pay and how many left it unchanged. We examine the characteristics of the companies that altered pay, and consider whether those that altered pay did so to “share the pain” or insulate CEOs from lost value.

Given the product qualities offered, the firms engage in price competition that segments the market. In each period each firm can spend on product innovation that if successful increases the quality of its product. Three types of Markov perfect equilibria are identified. A running-coasting equilibrium exhibits increasing quality dominance with one firm undertaking innovation and the other coasting to free ride on the innovation by the first firm. The firm that coasts can have the larger dynamic payoff, so quality dominance does not imply payoff dominance. A second is a leap-frog equilibrium in which the trailing firm undertakes innovation to leap into the lead. The trailing firm never innovates solely to narrow the gap with the leader, so catch up strategies are never used. In the third both firms undertake innovation, but if both have innovation successes, product differentiation remains the same and profits are reduced by the cost of innovation.

The intermediary, conciliatory, and divisive brokering orientations related differently to extraversion, agreeableness, perspective-taking, moral identity, and Machiavellianism, among other individual differences. The effects of brokering on social capital varied as a function of the brokering orientation and the aspect of social capital. Intermediary behavior garnered status; conciliatory behavior promoted trust and prestige; and divisive behavior fueled brokers’ perceived dominance.

Learning about a supplier’s impacts requires costly effort, but it is necessary (and sometimes sufficient) to reduce those impacts. The capital market valuation of a buying firm reflects investors’ estimate of future costs associated with a supplier’s impacts, as well as any costs that the buying firm incurs in order to learn about and reduce a supplier’s impacts. This paper analyzes a game theoretic model in which a manager — with the objective of maximizing the capital market valuation of the buying firm — decides whether to learn about a supplier’s impacts, how much cost to incur to reduce the supplier’s impacts, and whether to disclose the supplier’s impacts to investors. The investors have rational expectations (e.g., that a manager might withhold bad news about the supplier’s impacts) and value the buying firm accordingly. The paper considers a mandate to disclose information learned about a supplier’s impacts. The paper shows that the disclosure mandate deters learning and thus, under plausible conditions, results in higher expected impacts. The disclosure mandate can result in lower expected impacts only if buying firms face moderately high future costs associated with suppliers’ impacts. In contrast, a disclosure mandate always increases a buying firm’s expected discounted profit and capital market valuation. A disclosure mandate can induce cooperation among buying firms with a shared supplier, yet result in higher expected impacts by the supplier. When a buying firm has alternative suppliers, the disclosure mandate favors commitment to a supplier to facilitate learning about that supplier’s impacts (instead of searching for a lower-impact supplier).",55.0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.009971688482842366,False,carbon pricing

We also find that employer businesses as a whole are experiencing universal, negative impacts from the pandemic. In our national sample of Latino-owned employer businesses, we find that Latinos have fewer resources to weather the ongoing storm. Latino-owned businesses have less cash on hand and when requesting funding from the Payroll Protection Program, Latinos have their PPP loans approved at half the rate of white-owned businesses.

We believe our study provides the first evidence of the health-related effects of ACA Medicaid expansion using the Health and Retirement Study.

The HRS allows us to examine morbidity outcomes not available in administrative data, providing evidence of the mechanisms underlying emerging evidence of mortality reductions due to expanded insurance coverage among the near-elderly.

These findings indicate that a potential cost of asymmetric timeliness is added complexity from requiring investors to disaggregate earnings into good and bad news components to assess the implications of the earnings announcement for their investment decisions. Such a disaggregation impedes the speed with which investor disagreement and uncertainty resolve.

Blindsided by Social Risk: How Do Companies Survive a Storm of Their Own Making?,"David F.

This risk, which we describe as “social risk,” is more amorphous than the standard risks included in a company’s risk-management framework — and harder to plan for.

In this Closer Look, we use proprietary data from Marketing Scenario Analytica to examine how social risk manifests itself and what actions boards and companies can take to mitigate its impact.

We ask:

Given the sheer diversity of social risk, how can boards of directors prioritize their focus?
How can a company gauge at the onset whether a social risk will be major or minor?
What actions can senior officers take to mitigate the life of social risk?
How can social risk be incorporated into risk management frameworks?
What roles do management, audit, legal, and human resources play in this process?
How can boards evaluate how company culture and leadership influence the risk profile of the company?
What actions should they take if culture and leadership are deemed to increase risk?",55.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.03278028384855428,False,

Specifically, the value of an experience is also determined by the concurrent (during‐the‐experience) cognitive assessment of the event relative to the person’s associated goal progress/regression. CEE can account for during‐the‐experience and subsequent choices that people make. Examples of CEE include cognitive evaluations that enhance the experience value such as “good for me” (while eating kale), “I’m getting my money’s worth” (while using a new camera), and “I’m having a cultural experience” (while visiting a museum), or detract from the experience such as “I shouldn’t be doing this” (while smoking or overeating) and “should have chosen the other line” (while waiting at the supermarket checkout). Although prior research has examined hedonic experiences and their context (e.g., being with friends, commuting, colonoscopy) as well as what else the mind may process during an experience (e.g., wandering, thinking of past and future decisions), the concurrent value derived from the cognitive evaluation of the goal implications of an experience has not been identified as a separate experience value component.

It can also hinder performance by suppressing valuable contributions from lower-positioned individuals. Team-based care could mitigate negative effects by creating space for all team members to contribute their unique expertise.

Purpose: This article sought to understand how resident-medical assistant (MA) dyads interacted before and after primary care clinics transitioned to team-based care. We also studied how they negotiated changes in interpersonal dynamics given the challenge these changes presented to hierarchical norms.

Methodology: We conducted two qualitative interview studies, with 37 residents and 30 MAs at primary care clinics transitioning to team-based care. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed together using a thematic networks approach and focused coding.

Results: An intervention that promoted teamwork prompted resident-MA dyads to change their interactions to counter traditional hierarchy. Residents increasingly asked MAs questions about patient care, and MAs initiated interactions and volunteered ideas more frequently. We also found that MAs and residents expressed some discomfort with the hierarchical ambiguity that their new interactions produced and used alternate scripts to buffer this discomfort and to collaborate as teammates despite formal hierarchy.

Conclusion: Among resident-MA dyads, a team-based care intervention changed interpersonal dynamics by blurring hierarchical lines and shifting traditional boundaries in ways that were uncomfortable for both groups. They were able to work around discomfort by using new scripts that downplayed the threat to hierarchy.

Practice implications: Organizational structures that encourage greater interprofessional collaboration may neutralize barriers that formal hierarchy in medicine can pose for effective teamwork, but this process can also bring social discomfort. Our findings suggest that health care professionals may use microlevel strategies, such as alternative scripts, to overcome formal hierarchies without openly engaging them. Together, new organizational structures and interaction techniques can help professionals work around hierarchy and improve team performance.",56.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.03164530183500402,False,

This model is embedded within an optimization framework that selects which samples to test from each kit to maximize the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) yield (i.e., the number of kits that generate at least one DNA profile for the criminal DNA database) subject to a budget constraint. Our analysis predicts that, relative to a policy that tests only the samples deemed probative by the sexual assault forensic examiners, the proposed policy increases the CODIS yield by 45.4% without increasing the cost. Full testing of all samples has a slightly lower cost-effectiveness than the selective policy based on forensic examiners, but more than doubles the yield.

We argue that the former tends to undermine coordination and portends worsening firm profitability, while the latter facilitates creativity and supports greater patenting success and more positive market valuations. To evaluate these propositions, we use unsupervised learning to identify cultural content in employee reviews of nearly 500 publicly traded firms on a leading company review website and then develop novel, time-varying measures of cultural heterogeneity.

We examine how companies respond to such a situation, the choices they make, and how disclosure varies across industries and companies.

We ask:

What motivates some companies to be forthcoming about what they are experiencing, while others remain silent?
Do differences in disclosure reflect different degrees of certitude about how the virus would impact businesses, or differences in management perception of its obligations to shareholders?

Too Good to Hire?

In four experimental studies that use hiring managers as subjects, we test and show that managers perceive highly capable candidates to have lower commitment to the organization than less capable but adequate candidates and, as a result, penalize high-capability candidates in the hiring process. Our results show that managers have concerns about a high-capability candidate’s future commitment to the organization because they view highly capable candidates as having lower levels of organizational interest—meaning they care less about the mission and values of the organization and exert a lower level of effort toward those ends—and because they assume highly capable candidates have more outside job options, increasing their flight risk. Our findings highlight that capability signals do not necessarily afford candidates an advantage in selection, suggesting an upper limit on credentials and other signals of capability in helping candidates get jobs. Our study contributes to research on labor markets, human capital, and credentialing by offering a theory for why and when capability signals can negatively influence job candidate selection decisions.",57.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.01065614420387304,False,

We track each patient’s prescriptions longitudinally and use Cox’s time varying proportional hazard model to quantify the effect of taking antidepressants on the hazard rate of taking drugs associated with other chronic diseases quantified similarly by disease-relevant fill records. Controlling for socioeconomic variables, antidepressant use increased the hazard rate for drugs used for cardiovascular disease (1.59 fold), diabetes (1.30) and cancer (1.50). Antidepressant use also predicted substantially higher use of sedatives (3.06) and amphetamines (4.11).

For example, in personalized medicine, we seek to map patient observables (like age, gender, heart pressure, etc.) to a treatment choice using a data-driven rule. There has recently been a considerable amount of work on statistical methodology for policy learning, including Manski (2004), Zhao, Zeng, Rush, & Kosorok (2012), Swaminathan & Joachims (2015), Kitagawa & Tetenov (2018), van der Laan & Luedtke (2015), Luedtke & van der Laan (2016), Mbakop & Tabord-Meehan (2016), Athey & Wager (2017), Kallus & Zhou (2018), and Zhou, Athey, & Wager (2018). In particular, Kitagawa & Tetenov (2018) show that if we only consider policies π restricted to a class II with finite VC dimension and have access to data from a randomized trial with n samples, then an empirical welfare maximization algorithm achieves regret that scales as √VC(II)/n. Athey & Wager (2017) extend this result to observational studies via doubly robust scoring, and Zhou et al. (2018) further consider the case with multiple treatment choices (in particular, the regret will depend on the tree depth, feature space, and number of actions).

The package policytree for R (R Core Team, 2020) implements the multi-action doubly robust approach of Zhou et al. (2018) in the case where we want to learn policies π that belong to the class II of depth-k decision trees. In order to use policytree, the user starts by specifying a set of doubly robust scores for policy evaluation; the software then carries out globally optimal weighted search over decision trees.

It is well known that finding an optimal tree of arbitrary depth is NP-hard. However, if we restrict our attention to trees of depth k, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time. Here, we implement the global optimization via an exhaustive (unconstrained) tree search that runs in O(PkNk (log N + D) + PN log N) time, where N is the number of individuals, P the number of characteristics observed for each individual and D is the number of available treatment choices (see details below). If an individual’s characteristics only takes on a few discrete values, the runtime can be reduced by a factor of Nk. Additionally, an optional approximation parameter lets the user control how many splits to consider.",57.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.0202499996313765,False,

In the opening chapter, Dr. Hans Selye first defined stress as the “non-specific” response of the body to any demand made upon it. With the passage of time, Dr. Selye came to define stress as “the rate of wear and tear on the body. Still later in his career, Dr. Selye was again asked to define stress and responded, “Everyone knows what stress is, but nobody really knows.” These words sound vaguely familiar to the comment of “I know it when I see it” first used by United State Chief Justice Potter Stewart in 1964 to describe his threshold test or obscenity in Jacobellis v. Ohio.

Simply stated, stress is what we feel when we have to respond to a demand on our energy. Stress is a natural part of life, and occurs whenever there are significant changes in our lives, whether positive or negative. It is generally believed that some stress is okay (sometimes referred to as challenge or positive stress) but when stress occurs in amounts that individuals cannot cope with, both mental and physical changes may occur. Feeling stressed can feel perfectly normal, especially during exam time. One might notice that sometimes being stressed-out motivates the individual to focus on their work, yet at other times, one feels incredibly overwhelmed and finds it virtually impossible to concentrate on anything. While stress affects everyone in different ways, there are two major types of stress: stress that’s beneficial and motivating — good stress — and stress that causes anxiety and even health problems — bad stress.",57.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.03113156475253255,False,energy demand

The profit subsidy from wider tick sizes is also compromised by a significant shift in trading to “taker/maker” exchanges and to midpoint trading in non-exchange venues. The pilot’s exception for midpoint trades also accounts for the fact that nearly a third of trading remains in non-exchange venues despite the inclusion of a trade-at rule.

Under model misspecification, agnostic distribution shift between training and test data leads to inaccuracy of parameter estimation and instability of prediction across unknown test data. To address these problems, we propose a novel Decorrelated Weighting Regression algorithm which jointly optimizes a variable decorrelation regularizer and a weighted regression model. The variable decorrelation regularizer estimates a weight for each sample such that variables are decorrelated on the weighted training data. Then, these weights are used in the weighted regression to improve the accuracy of estimation on the effect of each variable, thus help to improve the stability of prediction across unknown test data.

Normatively speaking, the two formats are equivalent, as a voucher’s value is identical to that of the gift it represents. Yet this article suggests that promotion format (voucher vs. direct gift) influences consumers’ intention to purchase the focal product. Five lab experiments and one field experiment reveal that, compared with presenting a gift directly, introducing a voucher attenuates the influence of gift value on purchase decisions, decreasing purchase intentions for promotions offering high-value gifts but increasing purchase intentions for promotions offering low-value gifts. This effect occurs because vouchers break the direct association between the focal product and the gift, reducing people’s tendency to compare the gift’s value with the focal product’s value. The effect observed can be attenuated by increasing the salience of gift value.",58.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01043141118637359,False,

Yet, in significant ways, the current situation is markedly different than a typical recession. While in a typical recession, cash flows may experience a decline of, say, 10%, in the current COVID recession, cash flows for some firms will temporarily fall by 100%. Importantly, the current situation should be viewed as a pause: cash flows of many of the affected firms will bounce back once the COVID recession is past. However, before the pause is over, firms may face situations where they are unable to service their debts and other fixed financial commitments. These sudden but temporary cash flow stoppages may force many corporations to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But bankruptcy can lead to inefficient liquidation, a deadweight cost to the economy, which policy should aim to minimize.

The Fed has rolled out a number of new lending facilities that support the flow of credit to businesses. These measures include new funding facilities for commercial paper as well as for debt issuances in both the primary and secondary markets. Such facilities all aim to inject government risk-bearing capacity into the corporate bond market and thus reduce risk premia and bond yields.

While these programs aim in the right direction towards stabilizing the macroeconomy, their benefits will be diffused. The largest macro benefit of the Fed programs is to reduce the cost of borrowing and thus stave off bankruptcy. If, for example, Fed policy lowers the cost of rolling over debt from 10% to 5%, some corporate cash will be conserved. This savings may be enough to save some firms who are close to default. But importantly, the macro benefit is limited to avoiding deadweight costs of bankruptcy for these “at the margin” firms. Necessarily, the totality of these benefits will be small, because they apply to a set of firms much smaller than the universe of all firms.

We describe a more targeted approach to using the government’s risk bearing capacity to mitigate deadweight costs of bankruptcy. The goal is not to stop Chapter 11 restructurings from occurring, but rather to limit their deadweight costs when they do occur. There are two deadweight costs associated with bankruptcy: (i) inefficient liquidation of economically viable firms; and (ii) inefficient continuation of firms whose business models may be permanently unprofitable. In an economic pause, concern (i) is likely to be much more significant than (ii). Our policy therefore aims to minimize inefficient liquidations (while remaining mindful of (ii)).",58.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.02414972897773244,False,debt relief

Research on dynamic norms finds that learning that others are starting to eat less meat can inspire people to follow suit.

In Study 4, dynamic norms significantly reduced vegetarian orders.

These results raise two critical questions. First, where and with whom should a dynamic norm message reduce meat consumption? Our field data and past theory point to non-high socioeconomic contexts, and contexts where the reference group of people who have changed is meaningful to consumers. Second, how can the treatment be strengthened? Over five online experiments, we find that the visibility of the messages can be greatly improved, and more relatable norm referents can be selected.

Participants were students and staff at a U.S. West Coast private university, recruited between 2016 and 2019. Two experiments with one-week follow-up periods investigated the effects of viewing recommendations that prescribe a lower (vs. higher) amount of physical activity and provide a liberal (vs. stringent) definition of what counts as physical activity on individuals’ mindsets about the adequacy and health consequences of their physical activity, as well as physical activity-related self-efficacy, physical activity behavior, and perceived health.

Study 1 (N = 157) showed that exposure to low-and-liberal recommendations (vs. high-and-stringent recommendations) caused participants to adopt the mindset that their physical activity was more adequate, which in turn predicted greater engagement in physical activity and perceived health one week later. Study 2 (N = 272) showed that regardless of definition of physical activity (liberal vs. stringent), a lower (vs. higher) amount of recommended physical activity led participants to adopt the mindset that their activity was more adequate. This more adaptive mindset predicted greater self-efficacy and engagement in physical activity in the following week, in addition to better perceived health. Rather than inducing complacency, recommendations prescribing a relatively lower (vs. higher) amount of physical activity may be more effective at promoting physical activity and health by inducing adaptive mindsets.",58.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.05451476674733127,True,healthy lifestyles

We propose that people’s efforts to preserve their moral self-regard conform to a moral threshold model. This model predicts that people are primarily concerned with whether their prosocial behavior legitimates the claim that they have acted morally, a claim that often diverges from whether their behavior is in the best interests of the recipient. Specifically, it predicts that for people to feel moral following a prosocial decision, that decision need not have promised the greatest benefit for the recipient but only one larger than at least one other available outcome. Moreover, this model predicts that once people produce a benefit that exceeds this threshold, their moral self-regard is relatively insensitive to the magnitude of benefit that they produce.

In six studies, we test this moral threshold model by examining people’s prosocial risk decisions. We find that, compared with risky egoistic decisions, people systematically avoid making risky prosocial decisions that carry the possibility of producing the worst possible outcome in a choice set — even when this means avoiding a decision that is objectively superior. We further find that this aversion to producing the worst possible prosocial outcome leads people’s prosocial (vs. egoistic) risk decisions to be less sensitive to those decisions’ maximum possible benefit. We highlight theoretical and practical implications of these findings, including the detrimental consequence that people’s desire to protect their moral self-regard can have on the amount of good that they produce.",59.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.007013407809746601,False,

We introduce a novel, complementary measurement approach aimed at addressing both problems. We test on U.S. data (an expressly collected computer-assisted web interviewing survey dataset) a new, seven-point scale of partisanship constructed from PTV, or propensity-to-vote, items, acting as projective devices for capturing partisan preferences, and routinely employed in multi-party systems. We show that a PTV-based (suitable for comparative analysis) seven-point scale of partisanship outperforms the classic ANES scale.

Drawing on the theory of contextual integrity, we argue that it is time to rethink privacy and move beyond the questions of who collects what data to how the data are being used. Finally, we suggest that regulations of psychological targeting should be accompanied by a mindset that fosters (1) privacy by design to make it easy for individuals to act in line with their privacy goals, as well as (2) disclosure by choice, to allow individuals to freely decide whether and when they might be willing to forsake their privacy for better service.",59.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01928386428881616,False,data accountability

Drawing on a collection of findings suggesting that different social class contexts have powerful effects on people’s sense of self, we propose that social class shapes the beliefs that people hold about their abilities, and that this, in turn, has important implications for how status hierarchies perpetuate. We first hypothesize that compared with individuals with relatively low social class, individuals with relatively high social class are more overconfident. Then, drawing on research suggesting that overconfidence can confer social advantages, we further hypothesize that the overconfidence of higher class individuals can help perpetuate the existing class hierarchy: It can provide them a path to social advantage by making them appear more competent in the eyes of others.

We test these ideas in four large studies with a combined sample of 152,661 individuals. Study 1, a large field study featuring small-business owners from Mexico, found evidence that individuals with relatively high social class are more overconfident compared with their lower-class counterparts. Study 2, a multiwave study in the United States, replicated this result and further shed light on the underlying mechanism: Individuals with relatively high (vs. low) social class tend to be more overconfident because they have a stronger desire to achieve high social rank. Study 3 replicated these findings in a high-powered, preregistered study and found that individuals with relatively high social class were more overconfident, even in a task in which they had no performance advantages. Study 4, a multiphase study that featured a mock job interview in the laboratory, found that compared with their lower-class counterparts, higher-class individuals were more overconfident; overconfidence, in turn, made them appear more competent and more likely to attain social rank.",59.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.0434322104658413,False,

Short-run price variation could efficiently allocate resources at these critical times but only if consumers exhibit short-run demand elasticity. The question for firms in these markets has always been how to enable this response. Randomized control trials are increasingly used to test dynamic pricing and technologies that can assist in response by providing information and/or automated response. However, the trials typically do not randomize short-run prices. This paper illustrates how demand from a randomly assigned control group can be used to test the effectiveness of different technologies in increasing short-term price elasticity. To do so, we use a nonparametric control function approach that eliminates the bias inherent in estimating short-term price response using only household random assignment. We find that only automation technology leads to the short-term price elasticity needed to justify real-time pricing.",59.0,School Website,100,Goal 6,0.05583981938615733,True,global water demand

In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design‐based. In a design‐based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design‐based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design‐based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling‐based uncertainty.

Whereas advertisers have rapidly embraced the format on a variety of digital media, regulators have expressed serious concerns about whether this format materially deceives consumers because the advertising disclosure is incomplete or inappropriate. This has reignited a longstanding debate about the distinction between advertising and content in media markets, and how it affects consumers. This paper contributes to this debate by providing empirical evidence from a randomized experiment conducted on native advertising at a mobile restaurant-search platform. We experimentally vary the format of paid-search advertising, the extent to which ads are disclosed to over 200,000 users, and track their anonymized browsing behavior including clicks and conversions. The research design we propose uses comparisons of revealed preferences under experimentally manipulated treatment and control conditions to assess the potential for consumer confusion and deception. A design based on revealed preference speaks to the “material” standard of regulators, helps assess confusion while avoiding directly questioning consumers, and may be useful in other settings. Implementing the design, we find that native advertising benefits advertisers and detect no evidence of deception under typically used formats of disclosure currently used in the paid-search marketplace. Further investigation shows that the incremental conversions due to advertising are not driven by users clicking on the native ads. Rather, the benefits from advertising are driven by users seeing the ads and later clicking on the advertiser’s “organic” listings. Thus, we find little support of native advertising tricking users into clicking and driving them to advertisers as typically feared; instead, users seem to view ads and deliberately evaluate the advertisers. Furthermore, mere exposure seems sufficient to produce most of the incremental effect of advertising.",60.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01044273190134005,False,

Four main experiments and six supplemental studies (total N = 3,684) demonstrate that people prefer to direct persuasion efforts toward individuals who seem poised to shift their attitudes qualitatively (e.g., from negative to positive) rather than non-qualitatively (e.g., from positive to more positive). This preference stems from the fact that qualitative attitude change is perceived as greater in magnitude and expected to have a larger impact on behavior. These findings provide initial insight into the factors that drive persuasion target selection, and are inconsistent with what past persuasion research, conventional marketing wisdom, and our empirical evidence suggests persuaders should do.

We estimate expected DB accruals from the age-service and salary distributions of a large sample of U.S. corporate pension plans with more than 1,000 employees. Comparing the counterfactual DB accruals to the actual increase in 401(k) and other DC contributions for firms that freeze, we find only partial compensation to employees for the lost DB accruals. Net of the increase in total DC contributions, firms save 2.7–3.6% of payroll per year, and over a 10-year horizon they save 3.1% of total firm assets. Workers would have to value the structure, choice, flexibility, or portability of DC plans by at least this much more to experience welfare gains from freezes. The forgone accruals and net cost effects are initially largest for older employees but over time become largest for middle-aged employees who plan to stay with the firms until retirement. Furthermore, the probability that a firm freezes a pension plan is positively related to the value of new accruals as a share of firm assets. While there are differences in the age-service distributions of firms that freeze versus those that do not, we find that the differential accrual effect is largely driven by differences in benefit factors and the relative importance of labor in the freeze firm’s production function. The results overall support the hypothesis that pension freezes affect overall compensation and therefore that they change compensation costs relative to a worker’s marginal product.",61.0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.00752966839104479,False,

The classic defined benefit (DB) plan has largely been replaced by the defined contribution (DC) plan. With the latter, individual employees’ decisions about how much to save for retirement and how to invest those savings determine the benefits available upon retirement.

We analyze data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study to show that people whose only exposure to investment decisions is by virtue of their participation in an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan are poorly equipped to make sound investment decisions. Specifically, they suffer from higher levels of financial illiteracy than other investors. This lack of financial literacy is critical because of both the financial consequences of poor financial decisions and a legal structure that relies on participant choice to limit the fiduciary obligations of the employer with respect to the structure and options provided by the retirement plan.

In response to this concern, we propose mandated employer-provided financial education to address limited employee financial literacy. We identify and discuss three requirements that a financial education program should incorporate — a self-assessment, minimum substantive components, and timing. Formalizing the employer role in evaluating and increasing financial literacy among plan participants is a key step in providing retirement plan participants with the resources necessary to manage important decisions regarding retirement planning and, ultimately, for enhancing the financial security of American workers.",61.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.05764314171595538,True,education financing

Despite this progress, the gap between theory and practice remains significant, with theoreticians pursuing mathematical optimality at the cost of obtaining specialized procedures in different regimes (e.g., modulus of strong convexity, magnitude of target accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio), and with practitioners not readily able to know which regime is appropriate to their problem, and seeking broadly applicable algorithms that are reasonably close to optimality. To bridge these perspectives it is necessary to study algorithms that are adaptive to different regimes. We present the stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) method for composite convex finite-sum optimization problems and show that it is adaptive to both strong convexity and target accuracy. The adaptivity is achieved by batch variance reduction with adaptive batch sizes and a novel technique, which we refer to as geometrization, and which sets the length of each epoch as a geometric random variable. The algorithm achieves strictly better theoretical complexity than other existing adaptive algorithms, while the tuning parameters of the algorithm depend only on the smoothness parameter of the objective.",61.0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.009377420084598019,False,

We formulate this problem as a K-armed contextual bandit with high-dimensional covariates and present a new efficient bandit algorithm based on the LASSO estimator. We prove that our algorithm’s cumulative expected regret scales at most polylogarithmically in the covariate dimension d; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such bound for a contextual bandit. The key step in our analysis is proving a new tail inequality that guarantees the convergence of the LASSO estimator despite the non-i.i.d. data induced by the bandit policy. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical relevance of our algorithm by evaluating it on a simplified version of a medication dosing problem.

Our approach shows that manager approval increased the standard deviation of problem resolution, whereas queues are processed faster and have lower variance when there is oversight or teamwork, or when manager approval is bypassed due to independent action by problem solvers.

Not necessarily. Now consider what will happen on the next day of the sales. Facing deterministic demand, the physical goods vendor must have prepared the exact quantity of the product to sell, and thus all products are sold out. By contrast, the digital goods vendor will have no stock out, thanks to the nature of the digital good. Therefore, the rational vendor will try to sell more and achieve a higher profit after the sales date. To this end, the vendor will now lower the price to attract additional customers with lower reservation prices. The process will indefinitely continue. Knowing this would happen, customers will wait for the price reduction. Even the customers who would have purchased on the first day would defer the purchase until price gets lower. The digital goods vendor will anticipate this and accordingly lower the price on the first day and later, thereby compromising his profitability.

We implement the experiment on a mobile search platform that provides listings and reviews for an archetypal experience good, restaurants. In collaboration with the platform, we randomize about 200,000 users in 13 Asian cities into exposure of ads for about 600+ local restaurants. Within the exposure group, we randomly vary the disclosure to the consumer of whether a restaurant’s listing is a paid-ad. This enables isolating the effect on outcomes of a user knowing that a listing is sponsored — a pure signaling effect.

We find that this disclosure increases calls to the restaurant by 77%, holding fixed all other attributes of the ad. The disclosure effect is higher when the consumer uses the platform away from his typical city of search, when the uncertainty about restaurant quality is larger, and for restaurants that have received fewer ratings in the past. On the supply side, newer, higher rated and more popular restaurants are found to advertise more on the platform; and ratings of those that advertised during the experiment are found to be higher two years later. Taken together, we interpret these results as consistent with a signaling equilibrium in which ads serve as implicit signals that enhance the appeal of the advertised restaurants to consumers. Both consumers and advertisers seem to benefit from the signaling. Consumers shift choices towards restaurants that are better rated (at baseline) in the disclosure group compared to the no disclosure group, and advertisers gain from the improved outcomes induced by disclosure.",63.0,School Website,100,Goal 11,0.007417124471018864,False,

The discovery of the moderating role of shopping-list usage adds to the bubbling dialogue in goal pursuit and shopper psychology research concerning how consumer motivation follows either a monotonic trend (e.g., a goal gradient effect) or a nonmonotonic trend (e.g., the stuck-in-the-middle effect). Importantly, we demonstrate how the stuck-in-the-middle theory, which applies to single-goal pursuits, can apply more broadly to the domain of grocery shopping, which consists of the generation and completion of multiple subgoals.",63.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.006434818236062879,False,

In the context of the model analyzed in this study, the operational gains are subject to inherent volatility in both the price and the output of the intermediate product transferred within the vertically integrated structure. Our model framework provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the value (NPV) of an integrated system to exceed the sum of two optimized subsystems on their own. We then calibrate the model in Germany and Texas for systems that combine wind energy with Power‐to‐Gas (PtG) facilities that produce hydrogen. Depending on the prices for hydrogen in different market segments, we find that a synergistic investment value emerges in some settings. In the context of Texas, for instance, neither electricity generation from wind power nor hydrogen production from PtG is profitable on its own in the current market environment. Yet, provided both subsystems are sized optimally in relative terms, the attendant operational gains from vertical integration more than compensate for the stand‐alone losses of the two subsystems.",63.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.0973681279547797,True,energy sector investment

They test this argument using data from an original survey of 1,118 county-level party leaders. In experiments, they find that local party leaders most prefer nominating candidates who are similar to typical co-partisans, not centrists. Moreover, given the choice between a more centrist and more extreme candidate, they strongly prefer extremists: Democrats do so by about two to one and Republicans by 10 to one. Likewise, in open-ended questions, Democratic Party leaders are twice as likely to say they look for extreme candidates relative to centrists; Republican Party leaders are five times as likely.

Toward a Corporate Culture of Health: Results of a National Survey,"Michael Anne Kyle, Lumumba Seegars, John M. Benson, Robert J. Blendon, Robert S. Huckman, Sara Singer",The Millbank Quarterly,2019,The Millbank Quarterly September92019,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/toward-corporate-culture-health-results-national-survey,"Policy Points
The private sector has large potential influence over social determinants of health, but we have limited information about how businesses perceive or engage in actions to promote health and well‐being.
We conducted a national survey of more than 1,000 businesses of varying sizes and industries to benchmark private sector engagement in employee, environmental, consumer, and community health, which we collectively refer to as a corporate culture of health.
Overall, the private sector is taking steps to foster health and well‐being but still has substantial opportunity for growth.
Context

The private sector has a large potential role in advancing health and well‐being, but attention to corporate practices around health tends to focus on a narrow range of issues and on large businesses. Systematically describing private sector engagement in health and well‐being is a necessary step toward understanding the current state of the field and developing an agenda for businesses going forward.

Methods

We conducted a national survey of 1,017 private sector organizations to assess current levels of engagement in what we term a culture of health (CoH). We measured corporate CoH along four dimensions, which assess the extent to which businesses promote employee, environmental, consumer, and community health and well‐being. We also explored potential explanations for the number of health‐related actions taken in each dimension.

Findings

On average, businesses took 38% of health‐related actions included in our survey. For each dimension, we found variation among businesses in the number of actions taken (on average, there were almost fourfold differences between the bottom and top quartiles of businesses in terms of actions taken). Mentioning health and well‐being in the corporate mission, having a strategic plan for CoH, and perceiving a positive return on CoH investments were all associated with businesses’ actions taken. Fewer than half of businesses, however, perceived a positive return on their CoH investments.

Conclusions

Overall, the private sector is taking steps to foster health and well‐being. However, there remains substantial variation among businesses and opportunity for growth, even among those currently taking the most action. Strengthening the business case for a corporate CoH may increase private sector investments in health and well‐being. Actions taken by individual businesses, business groups, industries, and regulators have the potential to improve corporate engagement and impact.",63.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.1479603661828084,True,health investment

Eight experiments with a total of 3,221 participants in a variety of competitive contexts demonstrate that when observers forecast the outcome that another individual will experience, observers systematically overestimate the probability that this individual will win. Importantly, this misprediction stems from a previously undocumented lay belief—the belief that other people generally achieve their intentions—which skews observers’ hypothesis testing. We find that this lay belief biases observers’ forecasts even in contexts in which the other person’s intent is unlikely to generate the person’s intended outcome, and even when observers are directly incentivized to formulate an accurate forecast.",63.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.01055481753822041,False,

National Australia Bank Ltd. We find that the description of Morrison as a steamroller, substantially ending litigation against foreign issuers, is a myth. Instead, we find that Morrison did not significantly change the type of litigation brought against foreign issuers, which, both before and after this case, focused on foreign issuers with a U.S. listing and substantial U.S. trading volume. Although dismissal rates rose post-Morrison, we find no evidence that this was related to the decision. Settlement amounts and attorneys’ fees remained unchanged post-Morrison. We use these findings to theorize that Morrison was primarily a preemptive decision about standing that firmly delineated the exposure of foreign issuers to U.S. liability in response to the Vivendi case, which sought to expand the scope of liability for foreign issuers whose shares traded primarily in non-U.S. venues. When Morrison is placed in its true context, it is justified as a decision in line with administrative and court actions that have historically aligned firms’ U.S. liability to be proportional to their U.S. presence. Although Morrison had this defining effect, it did not change the litigation environment for foreign issuers, which was the oft-cited import of the decision.

We found that people were more likely to treat their goal pursuit as a competition when they were near the end (vs. at the beginning) of their individual goal and, thus, prioritized relative positional gain (i.e., performing better than others sharing similar pursuits) over making objective progress on their own goal, sabotaging others when they had the opportunity to do so (Studies 1-3B). Further, we provided evidence that certainty of goal attainment at a high (vs. low) level of progress drove this shift in focus, leading to such sabotage behaviors (Studies 3A and 3B). Ironically, success in gaining an upper hand against others in these pseudocompetitions led individuals to subsequently reduce their effort in their own pursuits (Studies 1-5).

We find that shifts in the demand and supply of safe dollar assets are important drivers of variation in the dollar exchange rate, bond yields, and other global financial variables. An increase in the convenience yield that foreign investors derive from holding safe dollar assets causes the dollar to appreciate, and incentivizes foreign debtors to tilt their issuance towards dollar-denominated instruments. U.S. monetary policy also affects the dollar exchange rate through its impact on the supply of safe dollar assets and the convenience yield. Interest rate spreads with foreign countries are not sufficient statistics to gauge the impact of the stance of U.S. monetary policy on currency markets.

Moreover, asset allocators’ judgments of the team’s competence were more strongly correlated with predictions about future performance (e.g., money raised) for racially homogenous teams than for racially diverse teams. Despite the apparent preference for racially diverse teams at weaker performance levels, asset allocators did not express a high likelihood of investing in these teams.

This treatment reduced citations among negatively stereotyped boys in 7th and 8th grades by 57% as compared with a randomized control condition, 95% CI [−77%, −20%]. A growth-mindset only treatment was also effective (70% reduction, 95% CI [−84%, −43%]). Experiment 2 tested the social-belonging intervention alone, a grade earlier, at a third school with a large Black population and more overall citations (N = 137 sixth-grade students). In 2 class sessions, students reflected on stories from previous 7th-grade students, which represented worries about belonging and relationships with teachers early in middle school as normal and as improving with time. This exercise reduced citations among Black boys through the end of high school by 65%, 95% CI [−85%, −15%], closing the disparity with White boys over 7 years by 75%. Suggesting improved interactions with teachers, longitudinal analyses found that the intervention prevented rises in citations involving subjective judgments (e.g., “insubordination”) within 6th and 7th grades. It also forestalled the emergence of worries about being seen stereotypically by the end of 7th grade. Identity threat can give rise to cycles of interaction that are maladaptive for both teachers and students in school; targeted exercises can interrupt these cycles to improve disciplinary outcomes over years.",64.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.02994819925298794,False,

To reach the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming well below 2°C, substantial parts of the world’s fossil fuels simply cannot be combusted and must be left in the ground (1, 2). Recent work thus suggests redirecting climate policies toward fossil fuel producers directly (3–5) by capping the flows of extraction and restricting the stocks of resources available for exploration. We synthesize key economic mechanisms that support this approach, arguing that an international treaty among fossil fuel–producing countries could (i) enhance the impact of the Paris Agreement in the presence of free riders; (ii) stimulate investment in low-carbon technology research and development (R&D); (iii) provide insurance against a failed Paris Agreement; and (iv) make carbon policies more acceptable to fossil fuel producers, thus increasing their support.

These findings are firmly supported by other independent and validated datasets, including long-term cross-border discharge, the water level in Syrian and Turkish reservoirs, and transborder groundwater flow.

Our focus is on agricultural value chains, where parties may transact through a channel that blends farmers’ produce (“commodity-based channel”) or that allows a one-on-one interaction between farmer and processor (“direct-sourcing channel”). Our study provides insights to companies seeking to incorporate responsible sourcing strategies while also creating economic value—a concept called “creating shared value.” We identify that the technology’s “cost elasticity” drives whether switching sourcing channel, changing contract structure, or adopting an integrated change is necessary to create shared value. This highlights that value chain innovations need to be properly designed—and sometimes combined—to achieve sustainable implementation.

We find that subsidiary information improves parent default prediction over and above group-level consolidated information possibly because intragroup exposures are netted out upon consolidation. Moreover, we document that improvements in parent default prediction decrease in the extent of parent-country financial reporting transparency, a finding that suggests that within-group information matters most when consolidated financial statements are expected to be of lower quality. We also show that parent and other group-firms’ default risk exhibits predictive power for subsidiary default.

In particular, we establish that profits and consumer surplus at the equilibrium corresponding to the platform’s optimal pricing and compensation policy are maximized when the demand pattern is “balanced” across the network’s locations. In addition, we show that they both increase monotonically with the balancedness of the demand pattern (as formalized by its structural properties). Furthermore, if the demand pattern is not balanced, the platform can benefit substantially from pricing rides differently depending on the location from which they originate.

We assume the seller has a strong form of limited commitment: she commits to the rules of the current auction but cannot commit to those of future auctions. We show that the celebrated Myersonian approach that leverages the envelope theorem fails in this setting, and therefore, characterizing the dynamic optimal mechanism seems intractable. Despite these challenges, we derive and characterize a near-optimal dynamic mechanism. To do so, we show that the Myersonian approach is recovered in a corresponding fluid continuous time model in which the time interval between consecutive items becomes negligible. Then we leverage this approach to characterize the optimal dynamic direct-revelation mechanism, highlighting novel incentives at play in settings with buyers’ budget constraints and seller’s limited commitment.

While there are many empirical and conceptual approaches to measuring and improving care coordination, use of theory is limited by its complexity and the wide variability of available frameworks. We systematically identified and categorized existing care coordination theoretical frameworks in new ways to make the theory-to-practice link more accessible.

METHODS: To identify relevant frameworks, we searched MEDLINE (R), Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SocINDEX from 2010 to May 2018, and various other nonbibliographic sources. We summarized framework characteristics and organized them using categories from the Sustainable integrated chronic care models for multi-morbidity: delivery, Financing, and performance (SELFIE) framework. Based on expert input, we then categorized available frameworks on consideration of whether they addressed contextual factors, what locus they addressed, and their design elements. We used predefined criteria for study selection and data abstraction.

RESULTS: Among 4389 citations, we identified 37 widely diverse frameworks, including 16 recent frameworks unidentified by previous reviews. Few led to development of measures (39%) or initiatives (6%). We identified 5 that are most relevant to primary care. The 2018 framework by Weaver et al., describing relationships between a wide range of primary care-specific domains, may be the most useful to those investigating the effectiveness of primary care coordination approaches. We also identified 3 frameworks focused on locus and design features of implementation that could prove especially useful to those responsible for implementing care coordination.

DISCUSSION: This review identified the most comprehensive frameworks and their main emphases for several general practice-relevant applications. Greater application of these frameworks in the design and evaluation of coordination approaches may increase their consistent implementation and measurement. Future research should emphasize implementation-focused frameworks that better identify factors and mechanisms through which an initiative achieves impact.",66.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.02430213692322535,False,

We propose an alternative method for estimation and statistical inference in regression discontinuity designs that uses numerical convex optimization to directly obtain the finite-sample-minimax linear estimator for the regression discontinuity parameter, subject to bounds on the second derivative of the conditional response function.

Cardiovascular and mental health comorbidities present potential coordination challenges relative to diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how cardiovascular and mental health comorbidities relate to patient-centered coordinated care in the Department of Veterans Affairs.

DESIGN: This observational study used a 2 x 2 factorial design to determine how cardiovascular and mental health comorbidities are associated with patient perceptions of coordinated care among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as a focal condition.

PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand eight hundred six patients attributed to 262 primary care providers, from a national sample of 29 medical centers, who had completed an online survey of patient-centered coordinated care in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

MAIN MEASURES: Eight dimensions from the Patient Perceptions of Integrated Care (PPIC) survey, a state-of-the-art measure of patients’ perspective on coordinated and patient-centered care.

KEY RESULTS: Mental health conditions were associated with significantly lower patient experiences of coordinated care. Hypotheses for disease severity were not supported, with associations in the hypothesized direction for only one dimension.

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that VA may be adequately addressing coordination needs related to cardiovascular conditions, but more attention could be placed on coordination for mental health conditions. While specialized programs for more severe conditions (e.g., heart failure and serious mental illness) are important, coordination is also needed for more common, less severe conditions (e.g., hypertension, depression, anxiety). Strengthening coordination for common, less severe conditions is particularly important as VA develops alternative models (e.g., community care) that may negatively impact the degree to which care is coordinated.",66.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.09668860271198049,True,mental health

We draw on the perceived diversity literature, hypothesizing that collectivistic norms cause group members to blur demographic differences, resulting in perceptions that group members are more similar than they actually are. Whether this benefits or harms group performance depends on the group’s objective diversity and the relevance of the perceived diversity attribute for accomplishing the task. For conjunctive tasks, the group’s performance is determined by its weakest member, demanding high levels of cohesion. Our theory suggests that collectivism benefits group conjunctive performance when objective national diversity is high by blurring divisive relational differences but has no effect in groups with low objective national diversity. In contrast, for disjunctive tasks, the group’s performance is determined by its best member. We predict that collectivism harms group disjunctive performance when objective expertness diversity is high by blurring differences in task-relevant expertness but has no effect in low objective expertness diversity groups. We find support for our theory in two studies, an archival study of 5,214 Himalayan climbing expeditions and a laboratory experiment assessing 366 groups. Our results show that collectivism has benefits and detriments for diverse groups and that these contradictory effects can be understood by identifying how the collectivistic blurring of perceived group diversity helps or hurts groups based on the type of tasks on which they are working.",67.0,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.01635582794032839,False,

We study a model where two countries each issue sovereign bonds to satisfy investors’ safe asset demands. The countries differ in the float of their bonds and their resources/fundamentals available to rollover debts. A sovereign’s debt is more likely to be safe if its fundamentals are strong relative to other possible safe assets, but not necessarily strong on an absolute basis. Debt float can enhance or detract from safety: If global demand for safe assets is high, a large float can enhance safety. The large float offers greater liquidity which increases demand for the large debt and thus reduces rollover risk. If demand for safe assets is low, then large debt size is a negative as rollover risk looms large. When global demand is high, countries may make fiscal/debt-structuring decisions to enhance their safe asset status. These actions have a tournament feature, and are self-defeating: countries may over-expand debt size to win the tournament. Coordination can generate benefits. The model sheds light on the effects of “Eurobonds” — i.e. a coordinated Euro-area-wide safe bond design. Eurobonds deliver welfare benefits only when they make up a sufficiently large fraction of countries’ debts.

Relying on competitor testing (i.e., having the regulator test only to verify evidence of violations provided by competitors) is most effective in large or concentrated markets in which firms have strong brands and high quality, and for standards that are highly valued by consumers. Under those conditions, firms tend to test competitors’ products and exert high compliance effort. Conversely, unless compliance is highly valued by consumers, a firm with low quality does not draw testing from competitors, and so does not comply. Enforcing a product standard through competitor testing encourages entry by such low-quality, noncompliant firms and can reduce quality investment by incumbents.

An important but overlooked question concerns the psychology behind such preferences: How do individuals act on authenticity when they encounter it? We suggest that the answer resides, at least in part, in the distinction between two fundamental but different meanings of authenticity: (a) attributions that a producer is true to its professed set of values (moral authenticity) and (b) attributions that a producer is true to its assigned or claimed social category (authenticity). Although this conceptual distinction has long been recognized by prior theory, empirical studies tend to conflate the two meanings. We provide a brief overview of these two interpretations and, in doing so, argue that they are both conceptually and empirically distinct. To that end, we develop a set of generalizable scales for measuring both meanings of authenticity. We go on to posit that individuals will respond differently depending on which interpretation is evoked. Specifically, we suggest that perceptions of moral authenticity will be associated with higher willingness-to-pay whereas perceptions of type authenticity will be associated with higher online ratings. We then examine diners’ responses to their restaurant experiences across a series of multimethod studies in the field as well as experiments; we also report a replication study in the music domain. Taken together, the findings generally support the notion that individuals’ interpretations of and behavioral responses to authenticity indeed vary across the two meanings of the concept",67.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01240946630307868,False,

We measure bank‐client relationships using loan contracts and measure client tax planning using either the cash effective tax rate or the unrecognized tax benefit balance. Using a difference‐in‐differences design, we find that firms experience meaningful tax reductions when they begin a relationship with a bank whose existing clients engage in above‐median tax planning. The effects of pairing with such tax intermediary banks are concentrated in relationships with larger or longer maturity loans, clients with foreign income or greater credit risk, and when the bank is an industry specialist or has above‐median investment banking activities. Finally, we find that potential clients are more likely to choose tax intermediary banks than nontax intermediary banks, suggesting that tax intermediary banks benefit by attracting new business.

We argue that, while automated pricing rules provide increased transparency, their complexity also limits the application of existing law. Using a simulation exercise based on real-world mortgage data to illustrate our arguments, we note that restricting the characteristics that the algorithms allowed to use can have a limited effect on disparity and can in fact increase pricing gaps. Furthermore, we argue that there are limits to interpreting the pricing rules set by machine learning that hinders the application of existing discrimination laws.

However, Medicare cannot directly monitor HAI rates, and instead relies on providers accurately self-reporting HAIs in claims data to correctly assess penalties. Consequently, the incentives for providers to improve service quality may disappear if providers upcode, i.e. mis-report HAIs (possibly unintentionally) in a manner that increases reimbursement or avoids financial penalties. Identifying upcoding in claims data is challenging due to unobservable confounders such as patient risk. Our approach leverages state-level variations in adverse event reporting regulations and instrumental variable techniques to discover contradictions in HAI and present-on-admission (POA) infection reporting rates that are strongly suggestive of upcoding. We conservatively estimate that over 10,000 out of nearly 60,000 annual reimbursed claims for POA infections (18.5%) were upcoded HAIs, resulting in an added cost burden of $200 million to Medicare. Our findings suggest that self-reported quality metrics are unreliable and thus, recent legislation may result in unintended consequences.

Our benchmark model involves two types of tasks, Easy and Hard, and servers that are either Junior or Senior in their abilities. The service provider determines a resource allocation policy, i.e., how to assign tasks to servers over time, with the goal of maximizing the system’s long-term throughput. Information about a task’s type can only be obtained while serving it. In particular, the more time a Junior server spends on a task without service completion, the higher her belief that the task is Hard and thus needs to be rerouted to a Senior server. This interplay between service time and task-type uncertainty implies that the system’s resource allocation policy and staffing levels implicitly determine how the provider prioritizes between learning and actually serving. We show that the performance loss due to the uncertainty in task types can be significant and, interestingly, that the system’s stability region is largely dependent on the rate at which information about tasks’ types is generated. Furthermore, we consider endogenizing the servers’ capabilities: assuming that training is costly, we explore the problem of jointly optimizing over the training levels of the system’s server pools, the staffing levels, and the resource allocation policy. We find that among optimal designs there always exists one with a “hierarchical” structure, where all tasks are initially routed to the least skilled servers and then progressively move to more skilled ones, if necessary.

The larger 80% of firms experience insignificant negative long-term returns. On a value-weighted basis, which likely best gauges the effects on shareholder wealth and the economy, we find that pre- to post-activism long-term returns insignificantly differ from zero. For operating performance, we find that prior results are a manifestation of abnormal trends in pre-activism performance. Using an appropriately matched sample, we find no evidence of abnormal post-activism performance improvements.

To test this hypothesis, we administered experiments to three groups that demand environmental regulations: voters, activists, and government officials. Our experiments revealed how each group responded to voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) by firms. Relatively modest VEPs dissuaded all three groups from seeking more draconian government regulations, a finding with important implications for social welfare.

This work examines whether financial constraints impact an important post-purchase behavior—word of mouth—and in what direction. Seven studies show that financial constraints reduce purchase-related word of mouth. This effect emerges across consumers’ reported frequencies of discussing their purchases, as well as their intentions, desires, and real decisions to engage in word of mouth. This effect is explained by reduced anticipated pleasure of engaging in purchase-related word of mouth, which results from financially constrained consumers’ belief that rehearsing their monetary expenditures will reinforce negative feelings about their limited financial situation. This effect cannot be similarly explained by other accounts such as impression management or the desire to hoard informational resources. Further, the authors show that the reduction in anticipated pleasure from word of mouth is specific to sharing about one’s monetary expenditures. Thus, financial constraints reduce purchase-related word of mouth, but they do not universally decrease one’s propensity to share.",68.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.01656245321451017,False,

In the female-typed product market of cupcakes, the producer’s gender does not affect ratings. Together, the two studies provide evidence of an asymmetric negative bias: products made by women are disadvantaged in male-typed markets, but products made by men are not disadvantaged in female-typed markets.

Our review led us to develop a novel framework as a means to integrate and organize a wide range of theoretical insights and empirical findings on brokerage and brokering. The Changing Others’ Relationships (COR) framework captures the following ideas that emerged from our review: (a) Different triadic configurations enable different forms of brokering, which in turn produce distinct effects on others’ relationships, (b) brokering is a multifaceted social influence process that can take the form of intermediation (connecting disconnected others) or modification (changing others’ preexisting relationships), (c) comparing social relations prebrokering versus postbrokering reveals a broker’s impact, (d) brokering can influence others’ relationships positively or negatively, and (e) information and incentives are two principal means through which individuals change others’ relationships.

Consequently, how increases in economic elites’ influence affect inequality depends on which industry’s elites are gaining influence and which policy issues are at stake. We demonstrate our argument with four original surveys, including the two largest political surveys of American economic elites to date: one of technology entrepreneurs — whose influence is burgeoning — and another of campaign donors.

With life expectancies rising, pension and social welfare systems are being strained. In many countries, employer-sponsored defined benefit (DB) pension plans are swiftly giving way to private defined contribution (DC) plans, shifting the responsibility for retirement saving and investing from employers to employees. Individuals have also experienced changes in labor markets. Skills are becoming more critical, leading to divergence in wages between those with a college education, or higher, and those with lower levels of education. Simultaneously, financial markets are rapidly changing, with developments in technology and new and more complex financial products. From student loans to mortgages, credit cards, mutual funds, and annuities, the range of financial products people have to choose from is very different from what it was in the past, and decisions relating to these financial products have implications for individual well-being. Moreover, the exponential growth in financial technology (fintech) is revolutionizing the way people make payments, decide about their financial investments, and seek financial advice. In this context, it is important to understand how financially knowledgeable people are and to what extent their knowledge of finance affects their financial decision-making.

An essential indicator of people’s ability to make financial decisions is their level of financial literacy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) aptly defines financial literacy as not only the knowledge and understanding of financial concepts and risks but also the skills, motivation, and confidence to apply such knowledge and understanding in order to make effective decisions across a range of financial contexts, to improve the financial well-being of individuals and society, and to enable participation in economic life. Thus, financial literacy refers to both knowledge and financial behavior, and this paper will analyze research on both topics.

As I describe in more detail below, findings around the world are sobering. Financial literacy is low even in advanced economies with well-developed financial markets. On average, about one third of the global population has familiarity with the basic concepts that underlie everyday financial decisions (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011c). The average hides gaping vulnerabilities of certain population subgroups and even lower knowledge of specific financial topics. Furthermore, there is evidence of a lack of confidence, particularly among women, and this has implications for how people approach and make financial decisions. In the following sections, I describe how we measure financial literacy, the levels of literacy we find around the world, the implications of those findings for financial decision-making, and how we can improve financial literacy.",70.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.06078530724696783,True,financial systems; global financial markets

We study how budget-constrained advertisers may compete in such sequential auctions in the presence of uncertainty about future bidding opportunities as well as competitors’ heterogeneous preferences, budgets, and strategies. We formulate this problem as a sequential game of incomplete information, where bidders know neither their own valuation distribution, nor the budgets and valuation distributions of their competitors. We introduce a family of dynamic bidding strategies we refer to as adaptive pacing strategies, in which advertisers adjust their bids throughout the campaign according to the sample path of expenditures they exhibit. We analyze the performance of these strategies under different assumptions on competitors’ behavior. Under arbitrary competitors’ bids, we establish through matching lower and upper bounds the asymptotic optimality of this class of strategies as the number of auctions grows large. When all the bidders adopt these strategies, the dynamics converge to a tractable and meaningful steady state. Moreover, we characterize a regime (well motivated in the context of display advertising markets) under which these strategies constitute an approximate Nash equilibrium in dynamic strategies: The benefit of unilaterally deviating to other strategies, including ones with access to complete information, becomes negligible as the number of auctions and competitors grows large. This establishes a connection between regret minimization and market stability, by which advertisers can essentially follow equilibrium bidding strategies that also ensure the best performance that can be guaranteed off-equilibrium.",70.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01547529468971422,False,

Additional evidence suggests that U.S. multinational claimants invest abroad rather than in the U.S. and that the increased investment by DPAD firms is accompanied by a reduction in the domestic workforce, consistent with a substitution of capital for labor. I show that the delayed investment response is due to firms engaging in other responses first, such as changing corporate reporting to shift income across time and borders.

Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler’s objective is to maximize cumulative expected earnings over some planning horizon of length T. To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation). The gambler’s policy is measured relative to a (static) oracle that knows the identity of the best arm a priori. The gap in performance between the former and latter is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small the regret can be as a function of problem primitives (hardness of the problem, typically measured as the distinguishability of the best arm) and the game horizon (T). This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time. The uncertainty in this set up is purely spatial and essentially amounts to identifying the optimal arm. We complement this literature by developing a flexible nonparametric model for temporal uncertainty in the rewards. The extent of temporal uncertainty is measured via the cumulative mean change of the rewards over the horizon, a metric we refer to as temporal variation, and regret is measured relative to a (dynamic) oracle that plays the pointwise optimal action at each instant in time. Assuming that nature can choose any sequence of mean rewards such that their temporal variation does not exceed V (viewed as a temporal uncertainty budget), we characterize the complexity of this MAB game via the minimax regret which depends on V (the hardness of the problem) the horizon length T and the number of arms K. When the uncertainty budget V is not known a priori, we develop a family of “master-slave” policies that adapt to the realized variation in rewards and provide numerical evidence suggesting that these policies are nearly minimax optimal.",70.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.01312256575161201,False,

Across 6 primary experiments and a series of supplemental studies (total N = 2,880), we find consistent support for a qualitative change hypothesis, whereby qualitative attitude change (change of valence; e.g., from negative to positive) is perceived as greater than otherwise equivalent non-qualitative attitude change (change within valence; e.g., from negative to less negative or from positive to more positive).

However, a reasonably well-supervised financial system would have been much more resilient to this and other types of severe shocks. Instead, the core of the financial system became a key channel of propagation and magnification of losses suffered in the housing market. Critical financial intermediaries failed, or were bailed out, or dramatically reduced their provision of liquidity and credit to the economy. In short, the core financial system ceased to perform its intended functions for the real economy at a reasonable level of effectiveness. As a result, the impact of the housing-market shock on the rest of the economy was much larger than necessary. In this essay, I will review the key sources of fragility in the core financial system. I discuss the weakly supervised balance sheets of the largest banks and investment banks; the run-prone designs and weak regulation of the markets for securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives; the undue reliance of regulators on market discipline; and the interplay of too-big-to-fail and the failure of market discipline. Finally, I point to some significant positive strides that have been made since the crisis: improvements in the capitalization of the largest financial institutions, a reduction of unsafe practices and infrastructure in the markets for securities financing and derivatives, and a significantly reduced presumption that the largest financial firms will be bailed out by taxpayer money in the future.

We find three main results. First, the negative effect of Chinese import penetration on local manufacturing employment documented in the existing literature is driven primarily by large, importing firms that simultaneously expand employment in non-manufacturing. A third of this negative manufacturing effect is accounted for by establishments switching their reported industry affiliation to non-manufacturing. Second, the reorganization of firm activity occurs mainly away from production of machinery, electronics, and transportation equipment towards wholesale, professional services (including R&D), and management. Together, the results are indicative of a “Silicone Valley” story of offshoring according to which firms focus U.S. activities on research, design, and distribution but produce the actual goods abroad. Third, the reorganization of firm activity occurs unevenly across local labor markets. The negative employment effects in manufacturing are concentrated in areas with below human capital (mainly the South and Mid-West) whereas most of the positive employment effects in non-manufacturing occur in areas with above average human capital (mainly the West and East coasts).

We argue that when whites perceive threats to their relative advantage in the racial status hierarchy, their resentment of minorities increases. This increased resentment in turn leads whites to withdraw support for welfare programs when they perceive these programs to primarily benefit minorities. Analysis of American National Election Studies data and two survey-embedded experiments support this reasoning. In Study 1, we find that whites’ racial resentment increased beginning in 2008, the year of Barack Obama’s successful presidential candidacy and a major economic downturn, the latter a factor previously shown to amplify racial threat effects. At the same time, whites’ opposition to welfare increased relative to minorities’. In Study 2, we sought to better establish the causal effect of racial status threats. We found that experimentally presenting information suggesting that the white majority is rapidly declining increased whites’ opposition to welfare, and this effect was mediated by heightened racial resentment. Finally, in Study 3 we found that threatening whites’ sense of their economic advantage over minorities led whites to report greater opposition to welfare programs, but only if these programs were portrayed as primarily benefiting minorities, not if they were portrayed as benefiting whites. These findings suggest that whites’ perceptions that minorities’ standing is rising can produce periods of “welfare backlash” in which adoption of policies restricting or curtailing welfare programs is more likely.",71.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01161022743768545,False,

Background

There remains a need to improve patient safety in primary care settings. Studies have demonstrated that creating high-performing teams can improve patient safety and encourage a safety culture within hospital settings, but little is known about this relationship in primary care.

Objective

To examine how team dynamics relate to perceptions of safety culture in primary care and whether care coordination plays an intermediating role.

Research Design

This is a cross-sectional survey study with 63% response (n = 1082).

Subjects

The study participants were attending clinicians, resident physicians and other staff who interacted with patients from 19 primary care practices affiliated with Harvard Medical School.

Main Measures

Three domains corresponding with our main measures: team dynamics, care coordination and safety culture. All items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale. We used linear regression clustered by practice site to assess the relationship between team dynamics and perceptions of safety culture. We also performed a mediation analysis to determine the extent to which care coordination explains the relationship between perceptions of team dynamics and of safety culture.

Results

For every 1-point increase in overall team dynamics, there was a 0.76-point increase in perception of safety culture [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–0.82, P < 0.001]. Care coordination mediated the relationship between team dynamics and the perception of safety culture.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest there is a relationship between team dynamics, care coordination and perceptions of patient safety in a primary care setting. To make patients safer, we may need to pay more attention to how primary care providers work together to coordinate care.",71.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.0197115693225919,False,

We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement—defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs—with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality—like humor and emotion—is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content—like mentions of price and deals—is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality–related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers’ path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook’s EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook’s behavioral targeting.

Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot-hand literature, which has generally found either no hot hand or a very weak hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for transferring defensive resources to equate shooting probabilities across players, whereas baseball does not. We then develop a method to test whether baseball teams do respond appropriately to hot opponents. Our results suggest teams respond in a manner consistent with drawing correct inference about the magnitude of the hot hand except for a tendency to overreact to very recent performance (i.e., the last five attempts).",71.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.009577916417646683,False,

The objective of this study was to understand the effect of citizen mobilization on both electoral outcomes and on the likelihood that new candidates will enter races to challenge incumbent politicians.

Methods

This study uses quantitative, longitudinal data (at the congressional‐district level) on protest, electoral outcomes, and challengers entering races, which are analyzed using an autoregressive distributed lagged regression model.

Results

Results show that protests that express liberal issues lead to a greater percentage of the two‐party vote share for Democratic candidates, while protests that espouse conservative issues offer Republican candidates a greater share of the two‐party vote. Additionally, results indicated that protest shines a light on incumbent politicians’ failure to address constituent concerns, which leads quality candidates to enter subsequent races to challenge incumbent politicians.

Conclusions

Citizen activism, which has been shown to impact state and firm policy decisions, also impacts electoral outcomes.",71.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.006634282264321209,False,

The authors present a theory proposing that the use of violence leads the general public to view a protest group as less reasonable, a perception that reduces identification with the group. This reduced identification in turn reduces public support for the violent group. Furthermore, the authors argue that violence also leads to more support for groups that are perceived as opposing the violent group. The authors test this theory using a large (n = 800) Internet-based survey experiment with a politically diverse sample. Participants responded to an experimental scenario based on recent violent confrontations between white nationalist protesters and antiracist counter-protesters, allowing the authors to study whether violent protest would reduce public support even when used against a widely reviled group. The authors found that the use of violence by an antiracist group against white nationalists led to decreased support for the antiracist group and increased support for the white nationalist group. Furthermore, the results were consistent with the theorized causal process: violence led to perceptions of unreasonableness, which reduced identification with and support for the protest group. Importantly, the results revealed a striking asymmetry: although acts of violence eroded support for an antiracist group, support for white nationalist groups was not reduced by the use of violence, perhaps because the public already perceives these groups as very unreasonable and identifies with them at low levels. Consistent with this interpretation, the authors found that self-identified Republicans, a subset of the sample that reported less extremely negative views of white nationalists, showed reduced support for white nationalists when they engaged in violence.",72.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.05631099511445085,True,violence against women

Drawing on two insights from research in cognition—that meaning inheres in cognitive associations between concepts, and that perceived associations constrain people’s actions—we introduce a model in which, rather than beliefs or behaviors, the things being transmitted between individuals are perceptions about what beliefs or behaviors are compatible with one another. Conventional contagion models require the assumption that networks are segregated to explain cultural variation. We show, in contrast, that the endogenous emergence of cultural differentiation can be entirely attributable to social cognition and does not require a segregated network or a preexisting division into groups.

Study 1 surveyed working adults who were in actual work groups and found that those who worked in more (vs. less) reward interdependent environments were more likely to think instrumentally and calculatively when considering potential colleagues. This mindset, in turn, was associated with a greater tendency to value competence over sociability. Studies 2 and 3 used an experimental design and found that when people imagined or anticipated working in a situation in which their economic outcomes depended in part on others, they were more likely to adopt an instrumental focus and choose a “competent jerk” over a “lovable fool.” These results call into question a vast social judgment literature that has made claims about the importance of sociability and related constructs without considering the context, and particularly the reward interdependence, often inherent in organizational contexts.

To satisfy these needs, a number of private-company marketplace have evolved to facilitate transactions between sellers and qualified buyers.

This Closer Look examines the practice of allowing employees to sell vested equity awards and the pricing employees receive in such transactions. We rely on two unique data sets: a survey of private (pre-IPO) companies and transaction data from SharesPost, a leading private-company marketplace.

We ask:

Should private companies allow their employees to sell equity prior to IPO?

We study how a firm’s ability to manipulate reports affects the terms of its debt contracts and the resulting investment and manipulation decisions that the firm implements. Our model generates novel empirical predictions regarding the use and the level of debt covenant, the interest rate, the efficiency of investment decisions, and the likelihood of covenant violations. For example, the model predicts that the optimal debt contract for firms with relatively strong (weak) corporate governance (i.e., cost of manipulation) induces overinvestment (underinvestment). Moreover, for firms with strong (weak) corporate governance, an increase in corporate governance quality leads to tighter (looser) covenant, more (less) frequent covenant violations and lower (higher) interest rate. Our model highlights that the interest rate, which is a common proxy for the cost of debt, neither accounts for the distortion of investment efficiency nor the expected manipulation costs arising under debt financing. We propose a measure of cost of debt capital that accounts for these effects.",73.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.04002283018878648,False,debt distress; debt restructuring; long-term debt sustainability

Adopting firms exhibit increased liquidity, share turnover, and firm-specific information relative to adopted and non-adopting firms. Neither adopted nor non-adopting firms suffer capital market consequences.

Deposit insurance and bailout expectations lead banks and borrowers to take on more risk.

In the case of climate change, some people have been found to systematically misinterpret climate data in ways that conflict with the intended message of climate scientists. While prior studies have attempted to reduce motivated reasoning through bipartisan communication networks, these networks have also been found to exacerbate bias. Popular theories hold that bipartisan networks amplify bias by exposing people to opposing beliefs. These theories are in tension with collective intelligence research, which shows that exchanging beliefs in social networks can facilitate social learning, thereby improving individual and group judgments. However, prior experiments in collective intelligence have relied almost exclusively on neutral questions that do not engage motivated reasoning.

Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment to test how bipartisan social networks can influence subjects’ interpretation of climate communications from NASA. Here, we show that exposure to opposing beliefs in structured bipartisan social networks substantially improved the accuracy of judgments among both conservatives and liberals, eliminating belief polarization. However, we also find that social learning can be reduced, and belief polarization maintained, as a result of partisan priming. We find that increasing the salience of partisanship during communication, both through exposure to the logos of political parties and through exposure to the political identities of network peers, can significantly reduce social learning.",73.0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.1207363346071447,True,climate change

In this article, I’ll explore the research that connects these two elements to employee health, and describe some examples of organizations that are succeeding at providing the autonomy, control, social connections, and support that foster physical and mental well-being.

As California and the United States as a whole continue to struggle with the challenge of providing high-quality health care at a manageable cost, it is worth asking whether managed competition—with its tools for harnessing market forces—continues to hold promise as a means of improving value in health care, and whether the standard conceptualization of managed competition should be modified in any way. In this article we reflect on four aspects of California’s health care ecosystem that provide insights into these questions: integrated delivery systems, patients’ choice of health plans, quality measurement, and new health care marketplace architectures such as Covered California and private insurance exchanges. Overall, while California’s experience with managed competition has resulted in some challenges and adaptations, it also gives reason to believe that principles of managed competition continue to have the potential to be a powerful force toward creating a more efficient health care system.

We suggest that this puzzle can be answered, at least partly, by considering two fundamental but different meanings of authenticity. We posit that individuals will react negatively when claims concern being true to a category (“type authenticity”) whereas they will react positively when claims concern being true to the organization’s values (“moral authenticity”). A major part of our reasoning involves the emotional reactions evoked by moral claims. Study 1 analyzed authenticity claims made in the texts of 1,393 restaurant menus and corresponding ratings of 449,919 online reviews from 2009 to 2016. Study 2 used an experiment to examine reactions to the two kinds of claims separately.

Although delegation has communal (e.g., relational) and agentic (e.g., assertive) properties, we argue that female leaders, as compared to male leaders, find it more difficult to delegate tasks due to gender-role incongruence. In five studies, we draw upon social role and backlash theories to show that women imbue delegation with more agentic traits, have more negative associations with delegating, and feel greater guilt about delegating than men. These associations result in women delegating less than men and, when they do delegate, having lower-quality interactions with subordinates. We further show that reframing delegation as communal attenuates women’s negative associations with delegation. These findings reveal that even when a given behavior has both agentic and communal elements, perceptions of agency can undermine women’s engagement in them. However, emphasizing the communal nature of seemingly agentic acts may encourage women’s engagement in such critical leadership behaviors.

Results for self-reported personality showed maturation effects (increases in extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and emotional stability), and this pattern was generally also reflected in other-reports, albeit with discrepancies regarding timing and magnitude. Age differences found for extraversion were similar between the self- and other-reports, but the increase found in self-reported conscientiousness was delayed in other-reports, and the curvilinear increase found in self-reported openness was slightly steeper in other-reports. Only emotional stability showed a distinct mismatch with an increase in self-reports, but no significant age effect in other-reports. Both the self- and other-reports of agreeableness showed no significant age trends. The trait correlations between the self- and other-reports increased with age for emotional stability, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness; by contrast, agreement regarding extraversion remained stable.

These findings have implications for collective action: perceiver’s own beliefs about their group’s relative disadvantage will impact who they view as a potential ally.

Motivated by the debate over how to deal with the huge backlog of untested sexual assault kits in the U.S.A., we construct and analyze a mathematical model that predicts the expected number of hits (i.e., a new DNA profile matches a DNA sample in the criminal database) as a function of both the proportion of the backlog that is tested and whether the victim–offender relationship is used to prioritize the kits that are tested. Refining the results in Ref. (Criminol Public Policy, 2016, 15, 555), we use data from Detroit, where government funding was used to process ≈15% of their backlog, to predict that prioritizing stranger kits over nonstranger kits leads to only a small improvement in performance (a 0.034 increase in the normalized area under the curve of the hits vs. proportion of backlog tested curve). Two rough but conservative cost-benefit analyses—one for testing the entire backlog and a marginal one for testing kits from nonstranger assaults—suggest that testing all sexual assault kits in the backlog is quite cost-effective: for example, spending ≈$1641 to test a kit averts sexual assaults costing ≈$133,484 on average.",74.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.01571920294647654,False,

We provide a characterization of the conditions under which upstream suppliers adopt sourcing strategies that are sub-optimal from the perspective of firms further downstream. Our analysis highlights that a focus on optimizing procurement decisions in each tier of the supply chain in isolation may not be sufficient for mitigating risks at an aggregate level. Rather, we argue that a holistic view of the entire supply network is necessary to properly assess and secure against disruptive events. Importantly, the misalignment we identify does not originate from cost or reliability asymmetries. Rather, firms’ sourcing decisions are driven by the interplay of the firms’ risk considerations with non-convexities in the production process.

Study 1 (N= 22,252) shows that reactions to unfamiliar musical excerpts predicted individual differences in personality — most notably, openness and extraversion — above and beyond demographic characteristics. Moreover, these personality traits were differentially associated with particular music-preference dimensions. The results from Study 2 (N= 21,929) replicated and extended these findings by showing that an active measure of naturally occurring behavior, Facebook Likes for musical artists, also predicted individual differences in personality.

We focus on a family of decision rules where the agent makes a new choice by randomly selecting an action with a probability approximately proportional to the amount of past rewards associated with each action in her memory.

We provide closed-form formulae for the agent’s steady-state choice distribution in the regime where the memory span is large (μ → 0), and show that the agent’s success critically depends on how quickly she updates her choices relative to the speed of memory decay. If β ≫ μ, the agent almost always chooses the best action, i.e., the one with the highest reward rate.

Our study investigates brokerage as a public good. We focus on the positive and negative externalities of specific kinds of brokers: “hubs,” who act as the main interfaces between members of their own network community (“network neighbors”) and members of other communities. Because hubs access diverse knowledge and perspectives, they create positive externalities by providing novel ideas to their network neighbors. But hubs also generate negative externalities: extensive cross-community activity puts heavy demands on their attention and time, so that hubs may not provide strong commitment to their neighbors’ projects. Because of this, network neighbors experience different externalities from hubs depending on their own formal role in projects. We use insights from our fieldwork in the French television game show industry to illustrate the mechanisms at play, and we test our theory with archival data on this industry from 1995 to 2012.

Head turn frequency, eye movements, and consumers’ direct choices in the lab and in the field are used to document a U-shaped pattern of information avoidance behavior, which paradoxically contributes to the phenomenon whereby goal pursuers become “stuck in the middle” of their pursuits.

Consumers choose to change channels to avoid TV ads, click away from paid online video ads, or discard direct mail without reading advertised details. As technological advances give firms improved abilities to target individual consumers through various media, it is becoming increasingly important for models to reflect the endogenous nature of ad consumption and to consider the implications that ad choice has for firms’ targeting strategies. With this motivation, we develop an empirical model of consumer demand for advertising in which demand for ads is jointly determined with demand for the advertised products. Building on Becker and Murphy (The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108(4), 941–964 1993)’s ideas, the model treats advertising as a good over which consumers have utility and obtains demands as the outcome of a joint utility maximization problem. Leveraging new data that links household-level TV ad-viewing with product purchases, we provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the model: ad-skipping is found to be lower when a household has purchased more of the advertised brand, and purchases are higher when more ads have been watched recently, suggesting that advertising and product consumption are jointly determined. Fitting a structural model of joint demand to the data, we evaluate consumer welfare and advertiser profitability in advertising targeting counterfactuals motivated by an “addressable” future of TV. We find that targeting on the predicted ad-skip probability is an attractive strategy, as it indirectly selects consumers that value the product. Reflecting the positive view of advertising in the model, we also find that net consumer welfare may increase in several targeting scenarios. This occurs because under improved targeting, firms shift advertising to those who are likely to value it. At the same time, consumers that do not value the ads end up skipping them, mitigating possible welfare losses. Both forces are relevant to assessing advertising effects in a world with improved targeting and ad-skipping technology.",75.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.0164320015061717,False,market distortions

Prevailing wisdom suggests that such inter-team resource conflicts unite teams internally, reducing intra-team power struggles. However, conflict spill-over theory suggests that inter-team conflicts may also stimulate competitive power dynamics within teams. We reconcile these two opposing lines of thought by introducing the internal power structure of teams as the key moderator that determines whether inter-team conflict reduces or promotes power struggles within teams. We theorize that while the common fate of members of egalitarian teams makes them likely to unite and pool resources when facing an inter-team conflict, the power differences in hierarchical teams cause members to be differently impacted by the resource-threatening inter-team conflict, leading them to have different perspectives and concerns, thereby promoting internal fights over resources (i.e., power struggles). In turn, such power struggles should negatively affect team performance. We tested these hypotheses with a laboratory study of 85 three-person negotiation teams and a field study of 158 organizational work teams, and find, as expected, that a resource-threatening inter-team conflict promotes performance-detracting power struggles in hierarchical (but not egalitarian) teams.",75.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.03557876843878802,False,conflict prevention; conflict resolution

We identify several mismatches between theoretical definitions of cumulative culture and their implementation in cultural transmission experiments. We argue that observed performance increase can be the result of participants learning faster in a group context rather than effectively leading to a cumulative effect. We also show that in laboratory experiments, participants are asked to complete quite simple tasks, which can undermine the evidential value of the diagnostic criterion traditionally used for cumulative culture (i.e. that cumulative culture is a process that produces solutions that no single individual could have invented on their own). We show that the use of unidimensional metrics of cumulativeness drastically curtail the variation that may be observed, which raises specific issues in the interpretation of the experimental evidence. We suggest several solutions to these mismatches (learning times, task complexity and variation) and develop the use of design spaces in experimentally investigating old and new questions about cumulative culture.",75.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.01145805480176671,False,

While intuition might predict that extending gender to these (human-abstracted) entities only further reinforces stereotypes, the current work presents a novel model and evidence demonstrating the opposing effect. Five studies demonstrate that gendering human-abstracted entities highlights how divorced psychological notions of gender are from biological sex, thereby decreasing gender stereotyping and penalties toward stereotype violators, through reducing essentialist views of gender.

Academic/practical relevance: With dynamic changes in global economic, political, and technological conditions, the design of global supply chain strategies has become critically important for executives and has great potential for operations management research. Methodology: Our work is based on a global field study conducted in 2014 and 2015 among leading manufacturers from a wide range of industries. The data set has the distinguishing feature of reflecting actual decisions that the firms made recently (during the last three years). Results: Companies are currently restructuring their global production footprints. The majority of firms engage in offshoring. Reshoring does occur but seldom for corrective reasons. China remains the most attractive site for production sourcing, followed by Eastern Europe and Southern Asia. Manufacturing continues to decline in the developed economies of Japan and Western Europe. We observe that while North America may be at the cusp of a manufacturing renaissance, such a change is not just because of reshoring by domestic firms. Labor cost no longer dominates manufacturing location decisions; rather, firms decide based on complex trade-offs among a variety of factors. Finally, firms localize production in developed economies and use developing economies as production hubs. Managerial implications: Our goal in this paper is to inform both managerial policy decisions and the academic research agenda by developing insights on managerial practices that concern production sourcing and on the factors that drive such decisions.

We also find significant differences across the major parties: firms working for Republicans charge higher prices, exert less effort, and induce less responsiveness in their clients’ advertising expenditures to electoral circumstances than do their Democratic counterparts. We connect this observation to the distribution of ideology among individual consulting firm employees, arguing that these higher rents incentivize consultants to work against their intrinsic ideological motivations.

We prove, under reasonable assumptions, that when the number of agent types is kept fixed, the relative size of the core vanishes rapidly as the number of agents grows. Numerical experiments confirm that the core is typically small. Our results provide justification for the typical assumption of a unique core outcome in such markets, which is close to a limit point.

However, common levelized cost measures used to guide decision-making, such as the levelized cost of electricity, implicitly assume that the values of random economic variables are known with certainty when investment decisions are made. This assumption implies, often incorrectly, that managerial flexibility carries zero value. This paper improves levelized cost measures by deriving an expansion that accounts for both uncertainties in relevant variables and the value of managerial flexibility in responding to them. This method is applied to quantify the value of flexibility in two example decision problems. In one, an operator of a natural gas electricity generation facility evaluates whether to invest in carbon capture capabilities. Another considers retirement decisions for U.S. nuclear plants. These examples illustrate that simplified cost metrics can inaccurately guide decision-making by inflating cost estimates relative to the proposed levelized cost measure that accounts for uncertainty and flexibility.",75.0,School Website,100,Goal 5,0.01558074474372367,False,

The tiki bar does eventually generate its own institutionalized social category, and many tiki bars fit the category and thereby possess type authenticity.

The potential to transform systems and leapfrog infrastructure can enable solutions that previously weren’t thought to be possible.

But the question remains: Are we at the pinnacle of a history-altering technology that will drive massive social impact, or is blockchain the latest tech buzzword — more noise than substance?

This study is a result of an analysis of 193 organizations, initiatives, and projects that are leveraging blockchain to drive social impact. By mapping and cataloging the landscape of such blockchain applications, our research captured which applications have already begun to demonstrate proven social impact, which industries and use cases are more or less advanced, and what we should be learning from the hundreds of test cases, pilots, and experiments that are using blockchain for social impact.

Key findings include:

We’re Still in the Early Days, but Impact Is Close

Blockchain initiatives dedicated to social impact are still early-stage — 34% were started in 2017 or later, and 74% are still in pilot / idea stage. But, 55% of social-good blockchain initiatives are estimated to impact beneficiaries by the end of 2018.

While many analytical methods have been developed for dealing with this challenge, they appear under‐utilized, perhaps due to the complexity and varied requirements for implementation. Thus, there is an unmet need to improve understanding the appropriate course of action to address unmeasured confounding under a variety of research scenarios.

Methods: We implemented a stepwise search strategy to find articles discussing the assessment of unmeasured confounding in electronic literature databases. Identified publications were reviewed and characterized by the applicable research settings and information requirements required for implementing each method. We further used this information to develop a best practice recommendation to help guide the selection of appropriate analytical methods for assessing the potential impact of unmeasured confounding.

Results: Over 100 papers were reviewed, and 15 methods were identified. We used a flowchart to illustrate the best practice recommendation which was driven by 2 critical components: (1) availability of information on the unmeasured confounders; and (2) goals of the unmeasured confounding assessment. Key factors for implementation of each method were summarized in a checklist to provide further assistance to researchers for implementing these methods.

Conclusion:  When assessing comparative effectiveness or safety in observational research, the impact of unmeasured confounding should not be ignored.

We develop a decentralized multiarmed bandit framework where a forward-looking principal (the platform designer) commits up front to a policy that dynamically discloses information regarding the history of outcomes to a series of short-lived rational agents (the consumers). We demonstrate that consumer surplus is nonmonotone in the accuracy of the designer’s information-provision policy. Because consumers are constantly in “exploitation” mode, policies that disclose accurate information on past outcomes suffer from inadequate “exploration.” We illustrate how the designer can (partially) alleviate this inefficiency by employing a policy that strategically obfuscates the information in the platform’s possession; interestingly, such a policy is beneficial despite the fact that consumers are aware of both the designer’s objective and the precise way by which information is being disclosed to them. More generally, we show that the optimal information-provision policy can be obtained as the solution of a large-scale linear program. Noting that such a solution is typically intractable, we use our structural findings to design an intuitive heuristic that underscores the value of information obfuscation in decentralized learning.

They propose that context effects resulting from the addition of a third option to a two-option set are more frequently observed when the added option is relatively similar (adjacent) to the “disadvantaged” alternative (i.e., the lower-share option) in the set.

Consumer switching generates inefficiency in the process of matching advertisers to consumers, because advertisers may not reach some consumers and may impress others too many times. We find that when advertisers are heterogeneous in their valuations for reaching consumers, the switching-induced inefficiency leads lower-value advertisers to advertise on a limited set of publishers, reducing the effective demand for advertising and thus depressing prices. As the share of switching consumers expands (e.g., when consumers adopt the Internet for news or increase their use of aggregators), ad prices fall. We demonstrate that increased switching creates an incentive for publishers to invest in quality as well as extend the number of unique users, because larger publishers are favored by advertisers seeking broader “reach” (more unique users) while avoiding inefficient duplication.",76.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.007442136622649063,False,

To bridge the digital divide, it is necessary to dig deeply into the minority elderly users of SNSs. This study explores usage patterns of elderly Facebook users and further investigates how their diverse characteristics influence their usage and social circles. Three findings were derived. First, a sharp digital divide on SNSs does exist, and existing elderly Facebook users are mainly the dabblers. Second, personality profiling could predict elderly people’s SNS usage behaviors. Elderly users with a high level of openness and extroversion have more friends, status updates, and group memberships, and those with a high level of conscientiousness have fewer likes and status updates. Elderly users are likely to seek insightful content on SNSs. Moreover, they may have a higher degree of emotional stability than young users when using SNSs. Third, elderly people tend to build small social circles on SNSs that “copy” the family relationship in the real world; whereas, they build large social circles with interests and hobbies that are difficult to share in the real world.

Instead of accepting loss aversion as true unless proven otherwise, we should treat it like other decision properties and psychological accounts that are contingent on various moderators and call for an analysis of psychological mechanisms. In this commentary, we suggest that gatekeepers, such as reviewers, tend to favor loss aversion and other widely accepted tendencies, while demanding a much higher support‐threshold for alternative or newer accounts.

Using a data set tracking customers of a North American specialty retail brand, we present empirical evidence that monitoring products online is associated with successfully obtaining discounts.

The randomized markdown policy benefits retailers by combining price commitment with the exploitation of heterogeneity in consumers’ monitoring costs.

Answering these questions is critical for businesses and activists alike, as we move into an era of heightened activism directed at firms. A growing area of research that is situated at the intersection of economic and political sociology, social movement studies, history, and organizational theory, tackles these questions, in an increasingly methodologically sophisticated and nuanced manner.

This body of research shows that social movements have both direct and indirect effects on businesses, and that these effects are amplified by media attention to activism. For example, we know that activism impacts the financial performance of firms, as well as their reputation. And, we know that the activities of social movements have consequences on firm policies and practices. In turn, businesses have developed a varied repertoire of ways to respond to activist demands. While some businesses ignore activists, others decide to retaliate against activists.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for decision makers with different classes of payoff functions to prefer one information structure to another. We also provide conditions under which two decision-makers in a given class can be ranked in terms of their information demand.

When Markov chains are used as a modeling framework for such studies, this data inadequacy can manifest itself as imprecise estimates for many elements of the transition matrix. In this paper, we study how to compute maximal and minimal values for the discounted value of the chain (with respect to a vector of state-wise costs or rewards) as these uncertain transition parameters jointly vary within a given uncertainty set. We show that these problems are computationally tractable if the uncertainty set has a row-wise structure. Conversely, we prove that if the row-wise structure is relaxed slightly, the problems become computationally intractable (NP-hard). We apply our model to assess the cost-effectiveness of fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), a new screening method for colorectal cancer. Our results show that despite the large uncertainty in FIT’s performance, it is highly cost-effective relative to the prevailing screening method of colonoscopy",78.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.007550365582412519,False,

We propose that disasters that are attributed to other community members weaken cooperation and reduce the formation of new cooperatives that serve the community, unlike disasters attributed to chance or to nature, which strengthen cooperation and increase the creation of cooperatives. We analyze the Spanish Flu, a contagious disease that was attributed to infected individuals, and compare it with spring frost, which damaged crops and was attributed to nature. Our measure of resilience is whether the community members could form retail cooperatives—non-profit community organizations. We find that communities hit by the Spanish Flu during the period 1918–1919 were unable to form new retail cooperatives in the short and long run after the epidemic, but this effect was reduced over time and countered by civic capacity.

We found consistently that personalizing the emails by adding consumer-specific information (e.g., recipient’s name) benefited the advertisers. Importantly, such content is not likely to be informative about the advertised product or the company. In our main experiment, we found that adding the name of the message recipient to the email’s subject line increased the probability of the recipient opening it by 20% (from 9.05% to 10.80%), which translated to an increase in sales’ leads by 31% (from 0.39% to 0.51%) and a reduction in the number of individuals unsubscribing from the email campaign by 17% (from 1.2% to 1.0%). We present similar experiments conducted with other companies, which show that the effects we document extend from objectives ranging from acquiring new customers to retaining customers who have purchased from the company in the past. Our investigation of several possible mechanisms suggests that such content increases the effort consumers make in processing the other content in the rest of the advertising message. Our paper quantifies the benefits from personalization and sheds light on the role of noninformative advertising content by analyzing several detailed measures of recipient’s interaction with the message.

We develop a method for debiasing penalized regression adjustments to allow sparse regression methods like the lasso to be used for √n‐consistent inference of average treatment effects in high dimensional linear models. Given linearity, we do not need to assume that the treatment propensities are estimable, or that the average treatment effect is a sparse contrast of the outcome model parameters. Rather, in addition to standard assumptions used to make lasso regression on the outcome model consistent under 1‐norm error, we require only overlap, i.e. that the propensity score be uniformly bounded away from 0 and 1.

Israel’s desalination plants are arguably the most energy-efficient in the world.

Official evaluations of increased introduction of solar-driven reverse osmosis (RO) processes concluded that mitigation of greenhouse gases will have to be attained in industries other than the water sector.

Competitive information supply from firms competing for attention can reduce consumers’ knowledge by causing information overload. A single firm subjected to a disclosure mandate may deliberately induce such information overload to obfuscate financially relevant information or engage in product complexification to bound consumers’ financial literacy. Thus, disclosure rules that would improve welfare for agents without attention limitations can prove ineffective for consumers with limited attention. Obfuscation suggests a role for rules that mandate not only the content, but also the format of disclosure; however, even rules that mandate ‘easy-to-understand’ formats can be ineffective against complexification, which may call for regulation of product design.",78.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.009148592550147643,False,

In contrast, two sets of archival data and five lab studies show that consumers are more willing to borrow for experiential versus material purchases, even though experiential purchases tend to have a shorter physical duration. Further, framing the same purchase as more experiential than material increases willingness to borrow. This effect occurs because purchase timing is more important for experiential purchases—a function of consumers’ aversion to missing out on planned consumption. Thus, we moderate the proposed effect by varying whether the borrowing decision impacts planned consumption. Other differences between material and experiential purchases, such as scarcity or expected happiness, cannot similarly explain our results. Moreover, our conceptualization allows us to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the previous and current research by examining the relative impact of purchase-timing importance and payment-benefit duration matching in different contexts (i.e., “purchasing” and “source-of-funding” decisions).",78.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.008201021541466508,False,

Facial features employed by the classifier included both fixed (e.g., nose shape) and transient facial features (e.g., grooming style). Consistent with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, gay men and women tended to have gender-atypical facial morphology, expression, and grooming styles. Prediction models aimed at gender alone allowed for detecting gay males with 57% accuracy and gay females with 58% accuracy. Those findings advance our understanding of the origins of sexual orientation and the limits of human perception.

The Super Bowl is well suited for evaluating advertising because viewers pay attention to the ads, more than 40% of households watch the game, and variation in ad exposures is exogenous because a brand cannot choose how many impressions it receives in each market. Viewership is primarily determined based on local preferences for watching the two competing teams. We combine Super Bowl ratings data with weekly sales data in the beer and soda categories to document three primary findings about advertising. First, the relationship between Super Bowl viewership and sales in the week leading up to the game reveals the brands customers buy to consume during the game. We find some brands are consumed while watching the game while others are not, but this is unrelated to whether a brand ever advertised during the Super Bowl or advertises in a specific year. This rejects the theory that advertising works by serving as a complement to brand consumption. Second, we find that post–Super Bowl sales effects of ad viewership are concentrated in weeks with subsequent sporting events. This suggests Super Bowl advertising builds a complementarity between the brand and sports viewership more broadly. Finally, we collect data on National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament viewership to test this theory and find that the complementarity between a brand’s sales and viewership of the tournament is enhanced by Super Bowl ad viewership.

This review focuses on prior and ongoing research on attitude certainty—the subjective sense of confidence of conviction a person has about an attitude—to provide a general overview of the role of certainty in attitudes and persuasion. First, we describe the antecedents, or origins, of attitude certainty, with particular attention to the metacognitive appraisals that drive people’s feelings of certainty or uncertainty about their own attitudes. Second, we review the known consequences of attitude certainty, emphasizing the role of certainty in shaping information processing, attitude strength, and attitudinal advocacy. Third, we discuss recent developments that point to an upside for uncertainty in persuasion, whereby uncertainty experienced during message processing can increase message engagement and, thus, enhance message impact. Finally, we highlight several promising directions for future research.

Do interest groups seek political access through their modest contributions, or are these contributions only a minor and forgettable part of the political process? In this article, we present comprehensive evidence that interest groups are extremely sophisticated in the way they make campaign contributions. We collect a new data set on U.S. state legislative committee assignments and legislator procedural powers from 1988 to 2014, merged with campaign finance data, in order to analyze over 440,000 candidate–committee observations across 99 legislatures. Using a series of difference-in-differences designs based on changes in individual legislators’ positions in the legislature, we not only show that interest groups seek out committee members, but we also show that they value what we call indirect access. When a legislator gains procedural powers, interest groups reallocate considerable amounts of money to her. The results reveal how interest groups in a wide range of democratic settings seek to influence the policy process not only by seeking direct access to policy makers but by seeking indirect access to legislative procedure as well.",79.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0303503131533366,False,

Finally, when the manager is more likely to have reporting discretion, discretionary accruals tend to be larger and more volatile. We estimate the model using U.S. earnings announcement data during 2002–2012 and find that the probability of misreporting is 7 percent.

Loyalty programs (LP) introduce a new currency—the points—through which customers transact with firms. Such points represent a promise for future service, and their monetary value thus counts as a liability on the issuing firms’ balance sheets. Consequently, adjusting the value of points has a first order effect on profitability and performance, and emerges as a core operating decision. We study the problem of optimally setting the points’ value in view of their associated liabilities. Academic / Practical Relevance: Firms across numerous industries increasingly utilize LPs. The sheer magnitude of LPs coupled with recent changes in accounting rules have turned the associated liabilities into significant balance sheet items, amounting to billions of dollars. Managers (from CFOs to CMOs) struggle with the problem of adjusting the points’ value in view of these liabilities. Academic work is primarily aimed at understanding LPs as marketing tools, without studying the liability angle. Methodology. We develop a multi-period model and use dynamic programming techniques and comparative statics analysis. Results: We show that the optimal policies depend on a new financial metric, given by the sum of the firm’s realized cash flows and outstanding deferred revenue, which we refer to as the profit potential. The total value of loyalty points is set to hit a particular target, which increases with the profit potential. We find that loyalty programs can act as buffers against uncertainty, with the value of points increasing (decreasing) under strong (weak) operating performance, and increasing with uncertainty. Managerial Implications: Setting the point values and adjusting operating decisions in view of LP liabilities should be done by tracking the firm’s profit potential.

We then examine institutional responses that decision makers can use to induce a policy-development monopolist to craft more-appealing proposals: (i) establishing in-house policy development capacity, (ii) delegating authority to an agent who counterbalances the monopolist’s preferences, and (iii) fostering competition by policy developers with different preferences.

Traditional methods correct the distribution shift by reweighting the training data with the ratio of the density between test and training data. In many applications training takes place without prior knowledge of the testing distribution on which the algorithm will be applied in the future. Recently, methods have been proposed to address the shift by learning causal structure, but those methods rely on the diversity of multiple training data to a good performance, and have complexity limitations in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Global Balancing Regression (DGBR) algorithm to jointly optimize a deep auto-encoder model for feature selection and a global balancing model for stable prediction across unknown environments. The global balancing model constructs balancing weights that facilitate estimating of partial effects of features (holding fixed all other features), a problem that is challenging in high dimensions, and thus helps to identify stable, causal relationships between features and outcomes. The deep auto-encoder model is designed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, thus making global balancing easier. We show, both theoretically and with empirical experiments, that our algorithm can make stable predictions across unknown environments. Our experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that our DGBR algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for stable prediction across unknown environments.",80.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.03323752323971014,False,

In 1991, Eiselt and Laporte established the first relation between Nash equilibria of a facility location game in a duopoly and the solutions to the 1-median problem. They showed that an equilibrium always exists in a tree because a location profile is at equilibrium if and only if both players select a 1-median of that tree [4]. In this work, we further explore the relations between the solutions to the 1-median problem and the equilibrium profiles. We show that if an equilibrium in a cycle exists, both players must choose a solution to the 1-median problem. We also obtain the same property for some other classes of graphs such as quasi-median graphs, median graphs, Helly graphs, and strongly-chordal graphs.

The behavioral literature in American politics suggests that voters are not informed enough, and are too partisan, to be swing voters, while the institutional literature suggests that moderate candidates tend to perform better. We speak to this debate by examining the link between the ideology of congressional candidates and the turnout of their parties’ bases in U.S. House races, 2006–2014. Combining a regression discontinuity design in close primary races with survey and administrative data on individual voter turnout, we find that extremist nominees — as measured by the mix of campaign contributions they receive — suffer electorally, largely because they decrease their party’s share of turnout in the general election, skewing the electorate towards their opponent’s party. The results help show how the behavioral and institutional literatures can be connected.

In this paper, we meta-analytically investigate different explanations for why and when hierarchy helps or hurts team effectiveness, drawing on results from 54 prior studies (N = 13,914 teams). Our findings show that, on net, hierarchy negatively impacts team effectiveness (performance: r = -.08; viability: r = -.11), and that this effect is mediated by increased conflict-enabling states. Additionally, we show that the negative relationship between hierarchy and team performance is exacerbated by aspects of the team structure (i.e., membership instability, skill differentiation) and the hierarchy itself (i.e., mutability), which make hierarchical teams prone to conflict. The predictions regarding the positive effect of hierarchy on team performance as mediated by coordination-enabling processes, and the moderating roles of several aspects of team tasks (i.e., interdependence, complexity) and the hierarchy (i.e., form) were not supported, with the exception that task ambiguity enhanced the positive effects of hierarchy.

This article examines a new signal of self-expressiveness: whether the product is polarizing—that is, whether some people strongly like the product and other people strongly dislike the product. Eight studies examine how polarization and its associated indicator in the online domain (a bimodal distribution of user star ratings) affects consumer preferences. The results indicate that polarizing products are perceived to be more self-expressive and to serve as stronger indicators of one’s tastes and personality. As a result, people find products with bimodal rating distributions to be more desirable when they experience temporary or chronic low self-concept clarity. Further, people evaluate products with bimodal distributions more favorably in consumption contexts in which self-expression is important. These effects emerge when the bimodal distribution pertains to a self-expressive attribute (e.g., style) but not when it pertains to a non-self-expressive attribute (e.g., quality). Last, the effect is especially strong when people have the motivation to express an individual- rather than group-level identity.

Second, when participants have multiple opportunities for experience and feedback, they still do not systematically use defaults. Third, we investigate beliefs related to the default effect.

Yet, we find that people systematically overestimate how much they will retrospect about their experiences. This overestimation results from people focusing on their desire to retrospect about experiences, while failing to consider the experience’s limited enduring accessibility in memory. Consistent with this view, we find that desirability is a stronger predictor of forecasted retrospection than it is of reported retrospection, resulting in greater overestimation when the desirability of retrospection is higher. Importantly, the desire to retrospect does not change over time. Instead, past experiences become less top-of-mind over time and, as a result, people simply forget to remember. In line with this account, our results show that obtaining physical reminders of an experience reduces the overestimation of retrospection by increasing how much people retrospect, bringing their realized retrospection more in line with their forecasts (and aspirations). We further observe that the extent to which reported retrospection falls short of forecasted retrospection reliably predicts declining satisfaction with an experience over time. Despite this potential negative consequence of retrospection falling short of expectations, we suggest that the initial overestimation itself may in fact be adaptive.

Yet the logics governing competitions themselves are decided through a higher-level “metacompetition” with other possible logics. Metacompetitions determine who can compete, how they can compete, the criteria that will be used to evaluate success and failure, and the payoffs to competition. When we ask “where do great strategies come from” but ignore metacompetition, we take as a given the very process that gives us the rules by which we determine greatness. In this paper I argue that to understand where great strategies come from, we must first understand how metacompetition determines which logics prevail in a market. I develop an ecological model of metacompetition, and I estimate the model using data on metacompetition in the digital music distribution industry.",81.0,Google Scholar,100,Goal 17,0.00844832544623529,False,

In additional analyses, we find that tilt appears to reflect an optimistic bias in target price forecasts as opposed to information about asymmetric state-contingent risk payoffs.

Laboratory studies show that such persuasive appeals are more effective in influencing behavior when they are tailored to individuals’ unique psychological characteristics. However, the investigation of large-scale psychological persuasion in the real world has been hindered by the questionnaire-based nature of psychological assessment. Recent research, however, shows that people’s psychological characteristics can be accurately predicted from their digital footprints, such as their Facebook Likes or Tweets. Capitalizing on this form of psychological assessment from digital footprints, we test the effects of psychological persuasion on people’s actual behavior in an ecologically valid setting. In three field experiments that reached over 3.5 million individuals with psychologically tailored advertising, we find that matching the content of persuasive appeals to individuals’ psychological characteristics significantly altered their behavior as measured by clicks and purchases. Persuasive appeals that were matched to people’s extraversion or openness-to-experience level resulted in up to 40% more clicks and up to 50% more purchases than their mismatching or unpersonalized counterparts.

We extend prior research that finds a positive association between integrated report quality (IRQ) and firm value by examining two channels through which this association may arise — a capital market channel and a real effects channel. To conduct these tests, we disaggregate firm value into three components: liquidity, cost of capital, and expected future cash flows. Using data from South Africa where integrated reporting is mandatory and an IRQ measure based on proprietary EY data, we find a positive association between IRQ and liquidity, which supports the capital market channel. We find no evidence of a relation between IRQ and cost of capital. We also find a positive association between IRQ and expected future cash flows. Because this association could reflect better investor cash flow forecasts — a capital market effect, better internal decisions — a real effect, or both, we attempt to distinguish these explanations. We find higher IRQ is (not) associated with higher realized future operating cash flows (greater analyst target price forecast accuracy), and find higher IRQ is associated with higher investment efficiency. These findings support the real effects channel.

We show that during the anticipatory phase, a process of denigration specific to the incumbent option is engendered. The subsequent jilt elicits a negative emotional response. During the affectively-charged post-jilt phase, preference shifts away from the now-denigrated incumbent option, yielding a jilting effect.

This research finds that the qualified pool of CEO talent to run the largest publicly traded companies in the United States is incredibly small, according to the directors who sit on the boards of these companies. The average director of a Fortune 250 company estimates that fewer than 4 people — including those both inside and outside their company — would be capable of stepping into the CEO role today and running it at least as well as their current CEO. They estimate that only 6 executives could perform as well as the CEO of their biggest competitor and only 9 would have the skills required to turn around a company struggling in their industry.”

Key Takeaways
CEO talent is exceptionally scarce
Tight labor market drives CEO Pay Higher
Boards face greater urgency to identify, develop and retain CEOs

“Almost across the board, directors of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies believe that the available pool of qualified CEO talent in their industry is small, the issue of ‘fit’ difficult to get right, and the downside risk of making the wrong choice high,” says Professor David F. Larcker of Stanford Graduate School of Business. “These findings have profound implications for talent development and CEO compensation: How you groom senior executives, how you plan for a CEO transition, and how you structure CEO pay really hinge on just how available replacement talent is.”

“Accurately assessing the scarcity of executive talent is one of the great ‘unanswered questions’ in governance,” adds Nick Donatiello, lecturer in corporate governance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “The feedback we received from the very board members who are responsible for making hiring decisions is that the number of highly talented CEOs is very limited. Recent succession challenges at major corporations — such as General Electric, Walt Disney, and Uber — are indicative of an extremely tight labor market for CEOs. Frankly, there is a lot of pressure on directors to get it right. This likely results in directors being risk averse, which of course only serves to narrow their view of who might be acceptable.”

According to Brian Tayan, researcher at Stanford Graduate School of Business, “It is not just the size and complexity of the corporation that make succession difficult. A candidate might meet all the criteria in terms of background and experience, but it is still hard to tell whether they have what it takes to succeed. Corporations with a visionary founder have the added challenge of planning to replace CEOs who have in many ways come to define their organization.”

Key Findings
The labor market for CEO talent among fortune 250 companies is extremely tight
The CEO role is extremely demanding, and few have the necessary skills
Visionary founder ceos are much more difficult to replace than professional CEOs
Recruiters and consultants offer a modestly more optimistic picture of the CEO labor market",83.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.01887737017716797,False,

We introduce a model that generalizes standard auction models to include this salient feature of FAs; we analyze this model theoretically and numerically. First, we show that FAs are subject to a sort of winner’s curse that in equilibrium induces higher expected buying prices relative to running first-price auctions as needs arise. Then, our results provide concrete design recommendations that alleviate this issue and decrease buying prices in FAs, highlighting the importance of (i) monitoring the price charged at the open market by the FA winner and using it to bound the buying price; (ii) investing in implementing price indexes for the random part of suppliers’ costs; and (iii) allowing suppliers the flexibility to reduce their prices to compete with the open market throughout the selling period.

To mitigate such risks, companies can invest in screening mechanisms and design incentive schemes in sourcing contracts. Common mitigation instruments include supplier certification, process audits, and contingency payments. The interactions of these instruments are often not well understood. We first note that the effectiveness of any mitigation instrument depends on how it changes the economic trade-offs faced by a supplier in compliance to social and environmental standard, and hence we develop a model that explicitly captures such trade-offs. As a result, our model endogenizes the supplier’s noncompliance probability and connects it with various factors, including the supplier’s intrinsic ethical level that is unobservable to the buyer. We then study the buyer’s optimal contracting problem under different mitigation instruments. We find that although the process audit and contingency payment instruments can directly lower supplier responsibility risk, they, acting alone, are not as effective as the supplier certification instrument in screening suppliers with different ethical levels. Nevertheless, these instruments are all complementary to each other; when used jointly, they make supplier screening more effective and result in lower sourcing cost.

Yet relying on contracts as a mechanism of control often comes at a cost to motivation. Integrating theoretical perspectives from psychology, economics, and organizational theory, we explore this control-motivation dilemma inherent in contracts and present the Contract-Autonomy-Motivation-Performance-Structure (CAMPS) model, which highlights the synergistic benefits of combining structure and autonomy. The model proposes that subtle reductions in the specificity of a contract’s language can boost autonomy, which increases intrinsic motivation and improves a range of desirable behaviors. Nine field and laboratory experiments found that less specific contracts increased task persistence, creativity, and cooperation, both immediately and longitudinally, because they boosted autonomy and intrinsic motivation. These positive effects, however, only occurred when contracts provided sufficient structure. Furthermore, the effects were limited to control-oriented clauses (i.e., legal clauses), and did not extend to coordination-oriented clauses (i.e., technical clauses). That is, there were synergistic benefits when a contract served as a scaffold that combined structure with general clauses. Overall, the current model and experiments identify a low-cost solution to the common problem of regulating social relationships: finding the right amount of contract specificity promotes desirable outcomes, including behaviors that are notoriously difficult to contract. The CAMPS model and the current set of empirical findings explain why, when, and how contracts can be used as an effective motivational tool.",83.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.00668685487839747,False,

This paper examines the accuracy of Americans’ perceptions of the absolute risk, attributable risk, and relative risk of lung cancer, and assesses which of these beliefs drive Americans’ smoking behavior. Using data from three national surveys, statistical analyses were performed by comparing means, medians, and distributions, and by employing Generalized Additive Models. Perceptions of relative risk were associated as expected with smoking onset and smoking cessation, whereas perceptions of absolute risk and attributable risk were not. Additionally, the relation of relative risk with smoking status was stronger among people who held their risk perceptions with more certainty. Most current smokers, former smokers, and never-smokers considerably underestimated the relative risk of smoking. If, as this paper suggests, people naturally think about the health consequences of smoking in terms of relative risk, smoking rates might be reduced if public understanding of the relative risks of smoking were more accurate and people held those beliefs with more confidence.",84.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.04208812817936749,False,

However, some industrial processes with relatively high CO2 flue concentration may be viable candidates to cost-competitively supply CO2 for utilization purposes (e.g., polymer manufacturing, etc.). This work develops a methodology that determines the levelized cost ($/tCO2) of separating, compressing, and transporting carbon dioxide. A top-down model determines the cost of separating and compressing CO2 across 18 industrial processes. Further, the study calculates the cost of transporting CO2 via pipeline and tanker truck to appropriately paired sinks using a bottom-up cost model and geo-referencing approach. The results show that truck transportation is generally the low-cost alternative given the relatively small volumes (ca. 100 kt CO2/a).

We study these questions using individual-level data from 70 randomized experiments run by a large online ticket resale platform. We estimate the redemption rates of the offers and also measure the broader impact of emailed promotions by comparing purchases by individuals who received the experimental promotions with purchases by those who did not receive the offers because of the experimental randomization. We find that the offers cause the average expenditure to increase significantly, by $3.03 (a 37.2% increase) during the promotion window. However, the redemption rate of these offers is low. Importantly, 90% of these gains are not through redemption of the offers. The individuals who spent more on the platform in the past are more responsive to the offers, and the effect of the offers is significantly higher among individuals who did not transact on the platform in the year before the offer was given. Interestingly, the offer causes carryover to the week after the promotion expires; we find that spending increases by $1.55 in the week after the offer expires. Additionally, we find evidence for cross category spillovers to nonpromoted products: offers not applicable to a ticket genre cause an increase in spending in that genre.

The purchase price method (PP) requires the acquirer to book the acquisition at historical cost, thereby underestimating the asset value by the amount of the acquirer’s surplus in the transaction. The exit value method (EV) is downward biased and forces the acquirer to book an accounting loss on the date of acquisition. EV connects otherwise independent valuations inducing a reporting-based winner’s curse and can even lead to fire-sale-like values. Relative to PP, EV implies lower asset prices, a decrease (increase) in the surplus of the seller (acquirer), and an increase in the probability that the asset attains its best use when the market is sufficiently competitive. Finally, I examine an alternative method in which the asset is valued at its perceived value-in-use (VU). Under this method, the acquirer bids more aggressively to increase perceived value-in-use, leading to a shift of surplus from the acquirer to the seller. Yet VU is unbiased and always maximizes the probability that the asset attains its best use.",84.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01024776712374582,False,

This research sought to examine the relationship of individuals’ perceptions about their level of physical activity with mortality outcomes at the population level.

Method



This study used 3 nationally representative samples with a total sample size of 61,141 U.S. adults (weighted N = 476 million). Data from the 1990 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 1999–2002/2003–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were linked to prospective National Death Index mortality data through 2011, yielding follow-up periods of up to 21 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between respondents’ perceptions of their relative level of physical activity (compared with other people their age) and all-cause mortality, adjusting for actual levels of physical activity, health status and behavior, and sociodemographic variables.

Results



Perceived physical activity relative to peers was associated with mortality risk. Individuals who perceived themselves as less active than others were up to 71% more likely to die in the follow-up period than those who perceived themselves as more active. This finding held across 3 samples and after adjusting for actual levels of physical activity and other covariates.

Conclusions



Individuals’ perceptions about their level of physical activity strongly predicted mortality, even after accounting for the effects of actual physical activity and other known determinants of mortality. This suggests that perceptions about health behaviors may play an important role in shaping health outcomes.",85.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.1107036851771835,True,health

Adopting a dynamic approach, this research examines how temporary standing—being ahead of (vs. behind) one’s opponent—in a multiphase competition shapes subsequent motivation. Six competitions conducted in the lab and in the field demonstrate that the impact of being ahead on contestants’ motivation depends on when (i.e., in which phase of the competition) contestants learn they are in the lead. In the early phase, contestants are concerned about whether they can win; being ahead increases motivation by making winning seem more attainable. In the later phase, however, contestants are instead driven by how much additional effort they believe they need to invest; being ahead decreases motivation by reducing contestants’ estimate of the remaining effort needed to win. Temporary standing thus has divergent effects on motivation in multiphase competitions, driven by a shift in contestants’ main concern from the early to the later phase and thus the meaning they derive from being ahead of their opponent. By leveraging insights gained from approaching individuals’ self-regulation as a dynamic process, this research advances understanding of how motivation evolves in a unique interdependent self-regulatory context.",85.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.003835353641856924,False,

Why Some Digital Companies Should Delay Profitability for as Long as They Can,"Robert E.

At its core, the principle means that the more of something that is made, the less valuable each incremental unit of that something becomes. If there were one pound of chocolate in the entire world, only the wealthiest individuals could afford to taste its unique flavor. If our oceans suddenly turned to chocolate, the incremental value of that volume would plummet — we’d truly have more chocolate than we really needed. The law of diminishing marginal returns held firm throughout the industrial era. The more of something we made, the less valuable it was to each incremental user down the demand curve.

That all changed in the internet era.

In the early 1980’s, Brian Arthur began speculating that in an increasingly tech-enabled world, the principle failed to capture something. He speculated that some industries actually demonstrated increasing returns. The more of something you distributed, the more valuable each incremental piece became. Arthur’s thinking ultimately led to our understanding of network effects and feedback loops. In the world of technology: the more of something you make, the more valuable it can become. Facebook becomes more valuable as more people in your network join. Messaging apps become more valuable as more people sign up. Marketplaces like eBay or Etsy become more valuable to each new member every time a new seller signs up and lists their wares.

For leaders that truly understand the implications of increasing returns, a natural deprioritization of profit harvesting should emerge. Consider a business like Amazon Web Services. For years, AWS has invested in driving developer and company adoption of its platform by driving down prices and introducing low cost features to make developer’s lives easier. This has led to high levels of AWS specific investment from innovators like CloudHealth Technologies, Qubole, Mapbox, and the like.

Neglect of such processes, we contend, stems from psychology’s long tradition of short-lag lab experiments where there is little scope for intervening behavioral processes. Studying process in the lab invariably involves studying psychological processes, but in long-lag field experiments it is important to study causally relevant behavioral processes as well as psychological ones. To illustrate the roles that behavioral processes can play in long-lag experiments we examine field experiments motivated by three policy-relevant goals: prejudice reduction, health promotion, and educational achievement. In each of the experiments discussed we identify various behavioral pathways through which the manipulated psychological state could have produced the observed outcome. We argue that if psychologists conducting long-lag interventions posited a theory of change that linked manipulated psychological states to outcomes via behavioral pathways, the result would be richer theory and more practically useful research.

First, people’s desire to see themselves as moral disposes them to make attributions that enhance or protect their moral self-image: When approached with a prosocial request, people are inclined to attribute their own noncompliance to external factors, while attributing their own compliance to internal factors. Second, these attributions can backfire when put to a material test. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that people who attribute their refusal of a prosocial request to an external factor (e.g., having an appointment), but then have that excuse removed, are more likely to engage in prosocial behavior than those who were never given an excuse to begin with. Study 3 shows that people view it as more morally reprehensible to no longer honor the acceptance of a prosocial request if an accompanying external incentive is removed than to refuse a request unaccompanied by an external incentive. Study 4 extends this finding and suggests that people who attribute the decision to behave prosocially to an internal factor despite the presence of an external incentive are more likely to continue to behave prosocially once the external incentive is removed than are those for whom no external incentive was ever offered.

We find that flexibility in replenishing or liquidating inventory, by providing risk-shifting incentives, could lead to borrowing costs that erase more than one-third of the firm’s value. In this context, we examine the effectiveness of practical and widely used covenants in restoring firm value by limiting such risk-shifting behavior. We find that simple financial covenants can fully restore value for a firm that possesses a midseason inventory liquidation option. In the presence of added flexibility in replenishing or partially liquidating inventory, financial covenants fail, but simple borrowing base covenants successfully restore firm value. Explicitly characterizing optimal covenant tightness for all these cases, we find that better market conditions, such as lower inventory depreciation rate, higher gross margins, or increased product demand, are typically associated with tighter covenants. Our results suggest that inventory-heavy firms can reap the full benefits of additional operating flexibility, irrespective of their leverage, by entering simple debt contracts of the type commonly employed in practice. For such contracts to be effective, however, firms with enhanced flexibility and/or operating in better markets must also be willing to abide by more and/or tighter covenants.",86.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01356947882366803,False,debt restructuring

Instead, high-status actors often experience a “status advantage”: they are rewarded disproportionately to the quality of their performance. We develop and test a theory of status advantage in meritocratic settings. The most influential model in past research derives status advantage from decision-makers’ tendency to infer quality from status when quality is uncertain. The theory developed here integrates and extends this and other theories to explain the emergence of status advantage in the many meritocratic contexts where the decision-maker’s personal, first-order sense of quality is less important to the decision. We argue that in such contexts, decision-makers must often coordinate with others to make the “best” decision, and thus they focus on the “third-order inference” problem of discerning who or what “most people” think is higher quality, as encoded in status beliefs. Three experiments demonstrate that under such conditions, status advantages can emerge even though (1) status information does not resolve uncertainty about quality; (2) the status belief is illegitimate; and (3) no party to the decision personally prefers the higher-status option. The theory implies that status hierarchies are resilient in the face of significant dissent but may be subject to public challenge.",86.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.01468911101104568,False,

Each supplier benefits from a reduction in the mean or variance of his own lead time, whereas the supplier’s profit is independent of the duration of the on-site tasks and the lead times of other suppliers.

Interestingly, though, these models overwhelmingly assume that this relationship is independent of valence. Across three studies we observe that this effect is in fact heavily influenced by two established valence asymmetries: positivity offset (baseline positive reactions even in the absence of positive information) and negativity bias (greater impact of negative reactions than positive reactions). Consistent with positivity offset, we observe that subjective ambivalence is greater when people have univalent negative rather than univalent positive attitudes. However, as conflicting information is acquired, subjective ambivalence rises more quickly when that information is negative rather than positive. The latter effect is consistent with negativity bias and suggests that although people feel more conflicted when they have only negative (versus only positive) reactions, they also feel more conflicted when they have mostly positive (versus mostly negative) reactions. Our investigation also uncovers an interesting consequence of these asymmetries: When people have mixed reactions, they do not experience maximum ambivalence at equal levels of positivity and negativity, as suggested by canonical ambivalence theory. Rather, subjective ambivalence peaks when positive reactions outnumber negative reactions. These effects are found to have downstream consequences for other dimensions of attitude strength.",87.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.003705889334560511,False,

We first establish the distinctiveness of the PIRD construct and assess its stability over time and across intergroup contexts (Studies 1–2). We then observe that greater PIRD predicts beliefs that colorblindness versus multiculturalism will improve race relations (Studies 2–5), in part because unintentional (versus intentional) discrimination is perceived to stem from ignorance and misunderstanding versus knowingly treating racial groups unequally (Studies 4, 5b). Evidence also suggests that PIRD may shape the actual merits of colorblindness and multiculturalism for improving race relations via encouraging donations (Study 6), positive interracial interaction intentions (Study 7), and comfort with discussing race following the widely-publicized shooting of a Black teen (Study 8).

Existing models of defensive aggression focus narrowly on the role fear plays in motivating preemptive strikes. Theoretically integrating the literatures on conflict, decision making, and emotion, the current research investigated how specific emotions associated with certainty or uncertainty, including fear, anger, disgust, hope, and happiness, influence preemptive strikes. Study 1 demonstrated that hope negatively predicts defensive exits from relationships in choice dilemmas. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally manipulated risk of being attacked in an incentivized, interactive decision making task-the Preemptive Strike Game. Risk of being attacked fueled preemptive strikes; reduced feelings of hope partially mediated this effect in Study 3. Studies 4 and 5 investigated preemptive strikes under uncertainty (rather than risk). In Study 4, reasoning about the factors that make one trustful of others curbed preemptive strikes; cogitating about the factors that underlie discrete emotions, however, did not influence defensive aggression. Study 5 demonstrated that the valence and uncertainty appraisals of incidental emotions interact in shaping preemptive strikes. Specifically, recalling an autobiographical emotional experience that produced hope significantly decreased attack rates relative to fear, happiness, and a control condition. Fear, anger, disgust, and happiness were either unrelated to preemptive strikes or showed inconsistent relationships with preemptive strikes across the 5 studies. These findings shed light on how emotions shape defensive aggression, advance knowledge on strategic choice under risk and uncertainty, and demonstrate hope’s positive effects on social interactions and relationships.",88.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.008916896881480672,False,

The study reveals that almost half of Americans believe CEOs should be fired (or worse) for unethical behavior. Violations of trust between company and customer are considered the most egregious. And, the public is surprisingly critical of CEOs who engage in “immoral” personal actions.

Key Takeaways
Almost half of Americans believe CEOs should be fired (or worse) for unethical behavior.
Violations of trust between company and customer are considered most egregious.
The public is surprisingly critical of CEOs who engage in “immoral” personal actions.

“We find that the public is highly critical of — and very willing to fire — CEOs who engage in behaviors that are morally or ethically questionable, even if these actions are not illegal and in some cases even if they cause no obvious harm to shareholders, employees, or the public,” says Professor David F. Larcker, Stanford Graduate School of Business. “This reflects, in part, the public’s lingering distrust of large corporations and CEOs in general.”

“It is not surprising, after years of stories in the press about CEOs getting away with bad behavior and in some cases earning large financial rewards along the way, that many Americans want to see higher levels of accountability,” adds Nick Donatiello, lecturer in corporate governance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “For corporations and their boards, this signals that the reputational ramifications for CEO misconduct — even personal misconduct — are very high, and require a decisive and public response.”

“The public’s highly negative assessment of immoral behavior is particularly unexpected,” says Brian Tayan, researcher at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “While we might expect that lying to the public about the quality of a company’s product would be criticized, the public was surprisingly judgmental about CEOs who make questionable personal decisions, such as having an affair with a subordinate. The line between ‘personal’ and ‘corporate’ matters is more blurred than we realized.”

Key Findings
Members of the public are extremely critical of CEOs who engage in questionable behavior.
The public believes a violation of trust between a company and its customers is the most egregious ethical violation a CEO can make.
Boards of directors are stricter than the public in administering punishment.
Americans are surprisingly critical of potentially immoral behavior.
Male and female CEOs are held to similar standards overall; however, some differences in perception exist.",88.0,School Website,100,Goal 11,0.01692760538941376,False,

Chronically low-power men and women given acute power were the most likely to say they would inappropriately pursue an unrequited workplace attraction (Studies 3 and 4). Finally, having power over an attractive woman increased harassment behavior among men with chronic low, but not high, power (Study 5).

Here we investigate how the interpersonal expression of positive and negative moral judgments encourages cooperation in groups and prosocial behavior between group members. In a laboratory experiment, groups whose members could make moral judgments achieved greater cooperation than groups with no capacity to sanction, levels comparable to those of groups featuring costly material sanctions. In addition, members of moral judgment groups subsequently showed more interpersonal trust, trustworthiness, and generosity than all other groups.

The aim of the current study was to explore whether cognitive, physiological and affective stress responses can be altered independent of situation-specific evaluations by changing individuals’ mindsets about the nature of stress in general.

Design: Using a 2 × 2 design, we experimentally manipulated stress mindset using multi-media film clips orienting participants (N = 113) to either the enhancing or debilitating nature of stress. We also manipulated challenge and threat evaluations by providing positive or negative feedback to participants during a social stress test.

Results: Results revealed that under both threat and challenge stress evaluations, a stress-is-enhancing mindset produced sharper increases in anabolic (“growth”) hormones relative to a stress-is-debilitating mindset. Furthermore, when the stress was evaluated as a challenge, a stress-is-enhancing mindset produced sharper increases in positive affect, heightened attentional bias towards positive stimuli, and greater cognitive flexibility, whereas a stress-is-debilitating mindset produced worse cognitive and affective outcomes.

Conclusions: These findings advance stress management theory and practice by demonstrating that a short manipulation designed to generate a stress-is-enhancing mindset can improve responses to both challenging and threatening stress.",88.0,School Website,100,Goal 6,0.0211096062206623,False,

Enabling Mini-Grid Development in Rural India,"Stephen D. Comello, Stefan J. Reichelstein, Anshuman Sahoo, Tobias Schmidt",World Development,2017,World Development January202017,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/enabling-mini-grid-development-rural-india,"Rural electrification rates in India lag behind government goals, in part due to the inability of distribution companies (discoms) to fund central grid expansion. In the absence of central grid electrification, mini-grids offer significant potential for an immediate pathway toward rural electrification and the attendant gains in economic growth and productivity. Yet private investment in mini-grids has been virtually absent in India. Using a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis, we find that mini-grids based on solar PV power and storage are more economical than incumbent energy services available to households without central grid connection.

Under current law, a prospective entrepreneur in India does not require a license or certification in order to build a mini-grid and subsequently provide electricity services in the area covered by said installation. Conversely, there is no legal or regulatory framework that specifies what is to happen if the central grid were to be extended to an area that is already covered by a mini-grid. We report detailed survey evidence from interviews with entrepreneurs, analysts and policymakers whose assessments converge on the same point: mini-grid investments would be jeopardized in the event of central grid extension, precisely because discoms would, by regulatory order, provide electricity services at highly subsidized rates, well below their full economic cost. Our fieldwork suggests that the threat of central grid extension is a gateway barrier preventing mini-grid development in India.

The issues associated with the gateway barrier have common elements with the so-called holdup problem as identified in the economics of organizations. There have been two recent federal policy guidelines and one actual state-level policy addressing the regulatory status of mini-grids. We examine the effectiveness of these policies/proposals in terms of an entrepreneur’s willingness to develop mini-grids in the future.",88.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.05393565317271491,True,electrification; energy sector investment; off-grid energy solutions

In two studies, individuals viewed several attributes describing a set of items and were asked to select their preferred item after a 12-hour interval that either contained sleep or was spent fully awake. After an overnight period including sleep, individuals showed increases in positive perceptions of the choice set. This finding contrasts with previous research showing that sleep selectively enhances recall for negative information. In addition, this increase in positive recall did not translate into a greater desire to purchase their preferred item or into an overall benefit for choice satisfaction. Time-of-day controls were used to confirm that the observed effects could not be explained by circadian influences. Thus, we show that people may feel more positive about the choice options but not more confident about the choice after ‘sleeping on’ a subjective decision.

A burgeoning literature demonstrates that one source of value emerges from the capacity for products to serve as a psychological salve that reduces various forms of distress across numerous domains. This review systematically organizes and integrates the literature on the use of consumer behavior as a means to regulate self-discrepancies, or the incongruities between how one currently perceives oneself and how one desires to view oneself (Higgins, 1987). We introduce a Compensatory Consumer Behavior Model to explain the psychological consequences of self-discrepancies on consumer behavior. This model delineates five distinct strategies by which consumers cope with self-discrepancies: direct resolution, symbolic self-completion, dissociation, escapism, and fluid compensation. Finally, the authors raise critical questions to guide future research endeavors. Overall, the present review provides both a primer on compensatory consumer behavior and sets an agenda for future research.",89.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.02087307657967166,False,consumer behavior

Although considerable past research suggests that people are more likely to advocate when they feel highly certain, there also is evidence for the opposite effect — that people sometimes advocate more when they experience a loss of certainty. The current research seeks to merge these insights. Specifically, we explore the possibility that the relationship between attitude certainty and attitudinal advocacy is curvilinear. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find evidence for a J-shaped curve: Advocacy intentions (and behavior) peak under high certainty, bottom out under moderate certainty, and show an uptick under low (relative to moderate) certainty. We document this relationship and investigate its potential mechanisms in three studies by examining advocacy intentions and the actual advocacy messages participants write when they feel high, moderate, or low certainty.",89.0,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.00552767643674778,False,

Rather than limiting human activity, higher earthquake intensity resulted in graded increases in usage of communications apps (e.g., social networking, messaging), functional apps (e.g., informational tools), and hedonic apps (e.g., music, videos, games). Combining mobile data with a field survey (N = 2,000) completed 1 week after the earthquake, we use an instrumental-variable approach to show that only increases in hedonic behavior reduced perceived risk. Thus, hedonic behavior could potentially serve as a population-scale coping and recovery strategy that is often missing in risk management and policy considerations.",89.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.02498062326684192,False,

Can third party intervention redirect competitive interactions toward collectively beneficial cooperation? Does mutual cooperation persist when the third party can no longer intervene in the conflict? To address these theoretically and practically important questions, we introduce the Repeated Peacemaker Game. Adversaries and third parties interacted for 60 game rounds in our incentivized experiment, producing a rich dataset of 7200 decisions. Participants made decisions under one of two conditions: In the Early Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially possible and then became impossible. In the Late Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially impossible and then became possible. Third parties in the Early Intervention condition intervened at high rates and established cooperative norms that outlasted the intervention period, resulting in sustainable cooperation even after intervention was no longer possible. By comparison, third parties in the Late Intervention condition intervened at relatively lower rates, but still effectively promoted cooperation, despite the initial history of competition between adversaries. We find strong evidence for ‘conditional cooperation’, whereby adversaries and third parties reciprocate each other’s choices in preceding rounds: Adversaries were more likely to cooperate when third parties intervened in the preceding round; third parties, in turn, were more likely to intervene when one or both adversaries cooperated in the preceding round than if both adversaries competed in the preceding round.

The first, relational heterogeneity, reflects the fact that the meaning of a response to a survey attitude question emerges from its relation to other attitudes: considered singly, the same response may mean different things to different respondents, depending upon the meanings with which they associate it. The second, population heterogeneity, a common problem in survey analysis, reflects the fact that attitudes may be related to one another in systematically different ways for different respondent subsamples. To overcome these challenges, we must use analytic methods that (a) focus on relations among attitude responses rather than on single responses and (b) partition survey samples into subsets based on patterns emergent from those relations. We use two such approaches, Latent Class Analysis and Relational Class Analysis, to examine Americans’ attitudes toward science and religion in the late 20th century, at the onset of a period of acute cultural contention between religious conservatives and secular liberals. Employing an unusually rich data set that enables us to take into account spiritualism (supernatural experience not sanctioned by formal religious institutions), as well as science and religion, we find that both LCA and RCA identify large subsets of respondents for whom science and religion are allied, rather than opposed. Moreover, RCA enables us to examine how the determinants of attitudes toward science, religion, and spiritualism are conditioned upon respondents’ construals of the relationships among them.

Currently available medication for treating many chronic diseases is often effective only for a subgroup of patients, and biomarkers accurately assessing whether an individual belongs to this subgroup typically do not exist. In such settings, physicians learn about the effectiveness of a drug primarily through experimentation, i.e., by initiating treatment and monitoring the patient’s response. Precise guidelines for discontinuing treatment are often lacking or left entirely to the physician’s discretion. We introduce a framework for developing adaptive, personalized treatments for such chronic diseases. Our model is based on a continuous-time, multi-armed bandit setting where drug effectiveness is assessed by aggregating information from several channels: by continuously monitoring the state of the patient, but also by (not) observing the occurrence of particular infrequent health events, such as relapses or disease flare-ups. Recognizing that the timing and severity of such events provides critical information for treatment decisions is a key point of departure in our framework compared with typical (bandit) models used in healthcare. We show that the model can be analyzed in closed form for several settings of interest, resulting in optimal policies that are intuitive and may have practical appeal. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology by developing a set of efficient treatment policies for multiple sclerosis, which we then use to benchmark several existing treatment guidelines.",89.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.05387867538367231,True,medical research

By prevailing in metacompetitions, organizations gain the advantage of competing in a game for which they are well suited, and the disadvantage of rivals who find themselves playing the wrong game.

Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted.

Research in political science argues that economic resources are critical for political engagement and thus the economic dislocation from disasters may dampen participation. We argue that when the government and civil society response effectively blunts a disaster’s economic impacts, then political engagement may increase as citizens learn about government capacity. Using diverse data from the massive 2010–11 Pakistan floods, we find that Pakistanis in highly flood-affected areas turned out to vote at substantially higher rates three years later than those less exposed.

Third, we integrate findings across levels of analysis into an emergent theory which explains why and when the benefits of power for individuals may paradoxically explain the potentially negative effects of power on team outcomes. We elaborate on how individual social comparisons within teams where at least one member has power increase intra-team power sensitivity, which we define as a state in which team members are excessively perceptive of, affected by, and responsive to resources.

In this chapter, we synthesize findings from these literatures to develop an overarching framework for conceptualizing and measuring the level of cultural fit and the dynamics of enculturation between individuals and social groups. We distinguish between the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of fitting in, which previous work has tended to either examine in isolation or to conflate. Reviewing the literature through this lens enables us to identify the strengths and limitations of unitary—that is, primarily cognitive or primarily behavioral—approaches to studying cultural fit. In contrast, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates the two perspectives and highlights the value of considering their interplay over time. We then identify promising theoretical pathways that can link the two dimensions of cultural fit.

We also examine the optimal allocation of property rights within a given class that satisfies (i), such as simple property rights, liability rules, and dual-chooser rules. We characterize property rights that minimize the expected subsidy required to implement efficiency. With two agents, simple property rights that are optimal in this way maximize the expected surplus at the status quo allocation, but this no longer holds with more agents. We also study “second-best” budget-balanced bargaining under a liability rule. The optimal “second-best” liability rule may differ from, but is often close to, the expectation of the victim’s harm, which would be optimal if there were no bargaining.

Given that organizational culture is hard to observe, we develop a novel approach to assessing individuals’ cultural fit with their colleagues in an organization based on the language expressed in internal email communications. Drawing on a unique data set that includes a corpus of 10.25 million email messages exchanged over five years among 601 employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint impedes, while cultural fit promotes, individual attainment.

We relax these assumptions and examine the attractiveness of long-short strategies as stand-alone investments and as a part of a diversified portfolio. Our analysis illustrates that the key benefit of long-short investing is adding diversification to a portfolio beyond what the market provides. We show that as stand-alone investments, nontrivial risk remains in the “hedge” strategies and that the returns generally do not beat the market in a head-to-head contest. Our findings raise questions about the degree of inefficiency in anomaly studies because plausible measures of costs generally offset strategy returns. The ability to achieve greater diversification may be, but is not necessarily, due to market inefficiency. We also highlight the key role of the generally ignored but critically important short interest rebate and show that absent this rebate, the long-short strategies we examine generally yield insignificant returns.",90.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.01220741675741962,False,economic diversification

This policy has recently been criticized on the grounds that it provides a subsidy for residential and commercial solar installations, a subsidy that is paid for by all ratepayers. In response, public utility commissions have begun to take up this regulatory issue. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of net metering restrictions. We examine the impact that overage tariffs will have on the size of future residential PV investments. Overage tariffs credit electricity generated by the solar system, but not consumed by the household and thus transferred back to the utility, at a rate below the going retail electricity rate. Our calculations focus on three representative locations in the states of California, Nevada and Hawaii. We find that if overage electricity is credited at some rate set at or above the levelized cost of electricity, there would be sufficient incentives for investors in residential solar PV to continue in the current mode of solar rooftop installations, even though the profitability of these investments might be reduced substantially. At the same time, we find that the LCOE is a tipping point insofar as overage tariffs set below that level would have a sharply negative effect on the individual size and overall volume of new rooftop installations.",91.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.01904952603413451,False,

The study reveals that while boards generally rate themselves positively in terms of skills and expertise, significantly high negatives are a cause for concern for a large number of firms.

Key findings include the following:

Directors Generally Believe Their Boards Have the Skills Needed to Advise and Oversee Their Companies

The vast majority (89 percent) of respondents say that their board has the skills and experience necessary to oversee the company.

Boards are less effective in taking proactive steps to ensure that they maintain a proper mix of skills. Only half (57 percent) of directors strongly agree or agree that their board is effective in bringing new talent to refresh the board’s capabilities before they become outdated, and only one-third of directors (34 percent) rate their board very positively on planning for director turnover.

Board Evaluations Are a Work in Process

Satisfaction levels with board evaluations are modest. Among companies that conduct evaluations, only 78 percent of directors are satisfied or very satisfied.

Board evaluations appear to be much less effective at the individual level. Only half (55 percent) of companies that conduct board evaluations evaluate individual directors, and only one-third (36 percent) believe that their company does a very good job of accurately assessing the performance of individual directors.

Boards Fall Short on Several Critical Dimensions

The results suggest that boards can improve in the following areas:

Trust Levels Are High, but Not High Enough

Only two-thirds (68 percent) of board members say they have a very high level of trust in their fellow directors.

Directors Do Not Give Each Other Honest Feedback

Only a quarter (23 percent) of board members rate their boards very effective at giving direct feedback to fellow directors.

Boardroom Dynamics Are Sub-Optimal

Directors report considerable shortcomings in group dynamics:

Directors do not invite the active participation of all members.
Directors allow personal or past experience to dominate their perspective.
Directors do not express their honest opinions in the presence of management.
Directors are too quick to come to consensus.
Directors do not understand the boundary between oversight and actively trying to manage the company.
Fellow board members derail the conversation by introducing issues that are off-topic.
Female Directors Assess Board Members More Negatively

Finally, female directors are significantly more likely to have negative views on their boards in the following dimensions:

The effectiveness of their fellow directors
The skills of their fellow directors
The board’s ability to evaluate and give feedback to fellow directors
Boardroom dynamics
Recommendations

To improve board functioning, the authors recommend the following:

Conduct a diagnostic where each director’s input is solicited around a variety of critical topics: board effectiveness, committee effectiveness, current board composition, the forward-looking needs of the board to meet the strategic needs of the enterprise, board structures and processes, agendas and materials, board interface with management, board succession process, and board leadership.
Provide a detailed report of the findings. Include recommended actions based upon short-, medium-, and long-term timeframes. Develop a skills-and-experience matrix to assist with board refreshment efforts, individual director coaching plans, and feedback sessions to provide directors with more detailed feedback around their effectiveness.
Create a process that is as independent as possible. Identify a point person on the board accountable for managing the process and following through on its recommendations. Develop a process for removing underperforming directors.",91.0,School Website,100,Goal 4,0.01207426767411971,False,

We argue that data from social networking sites should become a high priority for psychiatry research and mental health-care delivery. We illustrate our views using the world’s largest social networking site, Facebook, which currently has over 1 billion daily users (one in seven people worldwide). Facebook users can create personal profiles, socialize, express feelings, and share content, which Facebook stores as time-stamped digital records dating back to when the user first joined. Evidence suggests that 92% of adolescents go online daily and disclose considerably more about themselves online than offline. Thus, working with Facebook data could further our understanding of the onset and early years of mental illness, a crucial period of interpersonal development. Furthermore, a diminishing so-called digital divide has allowed for a broader sociodemographic to access Facebook, including homeless youth, young veterans, immigrants, people with mental health problems and seniors, enabling greater contact with traditionally hard-to-reach populations. While acknowledging that issues are far from settled about the role that social media should play in mental health, we argue that it should no longer be a debate about whether researchers and health-care providers engage with social networking sites, but rather how best to use this technology to promote positive change. We discuss how Facebook data can advance psychiatry research and how user-level data could potentially enhance the clinical delivery of personalized patient care.

This ambiguity has constrained progress in both developing a coherent theory of organizational culture and accreting replicable and valid findings. To make progress we argue that future research should focus on conceptualizing and assessing organizational culture as the norms that characterize a group or organization that if widely shared and strongly held, act as a social control system to shape members’ attitudes and behaviors. We further argue that to accomplish this, researchers need to recognize that norms can be parsed into three distinct dimensions: (1) the content or what is deemed important (e.g., teamwork, accountability, innovation), (2) the consensus or how widely shared norms are held across people, and (3) the intensity of feelings about the importance of the norm (e.g., are people willing to sanction others).

They keep more functions in-house — a necessary part of launching an innovation. But if incumbents do likewise in their own efforts to take advantage of digital technology, they risk upsetting longtime relationships with suppliers, distributors, and other collaborators.

To navigate this new world, the authors advise managers in traditional companies to think about the macro trends that will shape their industry in the future, agree on a digital strategy to address customers’ needs in the long term, and develop better metrics to monitor progress.

However, bidders can also strategically take advantage of this flexibility, by discounting package bids and “inflating” bid prices for single items, even in the absence of cost synergies; the latter behavior can hurt the performance of the auction. It is an empirical question whether allowing package bids and running a CA improves performance in a given setting. In this paper, we develop a structural estimation approach that estimates the firms’ cost structure using bidding data and use these estimates to evaluate the performance of the auction. To overcome the computational difficulties arising from the large number of bids observed in large-scale CAs, we propose a novel simplified model of bidders’ behavior based on pricing package characteristics. We apply our method to the Chilean school meals auction, in which the government procures half a billion dollars’ worth of meal services every year and bidders submit thousands of package bids. Our estimates suggest that bidders’ cost synergies are economically significant in this application (∼5%), and the current CA mechanism achieves high allocative efficiency (∼98%) and reasonable margins for the bidders (∼5%). Overall, this work develops the first practical tool to evaluate the performance of large-scale first-price CAs commonly used in procurement settings.",91.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.008786112319669342,False,

Increasing assortment size has a more positive effect on the likelihood of consumers to make a purchase when the initial decision emphasis is on whether to make a purchase from a given set of options, as opposed to first identifying the best available option in the set. This prediction is based on the proposition that decision order determines how likely consumers are to make trade-offs between the perceived costs and benefits associated with a large product assortment, and that the benefits are given relatively greater weight when consumers decide first “whether to buy” (rather than “which option to choose”).

When production lead-time is long and the selling season is short, the retailer has to place an order ahead of the season, which resembles the classical Newsvendor model. However, we consider the situation when the supplier agrees to deliver the order in multiple shipments in the season, and then the retailer needs to determine the quantity and/or timing of each shipment. Under a centralized setting, we derive the optimal quantity and/or timing decisions of the retailer. Under a decentralized setting, incentive misalignment arises from ineffective allocation of inventory costs between the parties, in addition to the well- known double marginalization effect. Hence, we devise an incentive contract, which involves a risk-sharing mechanism at the end of the season and an inventory subsidizing scheme for the entire season; in practice, the inventory subsidizing scheme can be implemented in different ways, such as a direct subsidizing scheme or a delayed-payment scheme. The proposed contract can achieve channel coordination and Pareto optimality. Furthermore, we can show that the inventory subsidizing scheme plays a key role in channel coordination because without the inventory subsidizing scheme, the loss of supply chain efficiency is almost always significant.",91.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.009172985436521335,False,supply chain disruptions

In particular, unicorn skeptics posit that VC investors agree to use these valuations in exchange for receiving enhanced preferred stock preferences, particularly enhanced liquidation preferences that are payable on a sale of the company. By examining how liquidation preferences affect expected returns of founders and VC investors, this chapter argues that unicorn valuations are indeed unreliable measures of firm value but not for the reasons suggested by unicorn skeptics. While offering enhanced liquidation preferences to an investor can overcome the reduction in expected returns caused by financing a firm at a higher valuation, doing so will generally be more detrimental to a founder’s expected returns than if the financing were done at a lower valuation using a conventional liquidation preference. Rather, this chapter argues that unicorn valuations are unreliable measures of firm value for the same reason that all start-up valuations are unreliable measures of firm value – namely, the common practice among VC investors to price VC financings as if they are purchasing common stock when they are acquiring preferred stock with downside economic protections. As a result of this practice, the reported valuations of unicorns and non-unicorns alike can be significantly higher than the enterprise value an investor is implicitly placing on a firm when financing it. For founders and prior stockholders, this insight has important implications for understanding the effective enterprise value being used in a financing and avoiding unintended dilution.",92.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.00821780751851947,False,

Thus each type of accrual has a different coefficient in valuation and forecasting cash flows or earnings. Each coefficient combines an information weight reflecting the information that accrual type provides and a multiple reflecting how that information is used in valuation and cash flow and earnings forecasting.

The extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised) options. Higher ad intensity leads to a stronger direct effect favoring the advertiser and can offset the spillover caused by the broader reminder.",92.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.00470651829288346,False,
Gadflies at the Gate: Why Do Individual Investors Sponsor Shareholder Resolutions?,"David F.

Defenders respond that every shareholder is a legitimate participant in corporate governance and that shareholder resolutions are an important means of exercising voting and economic rights to improve corporate outcomes.

In this Closer Look, we examine the topic of individual shareholder activism in detail. We ask:

Are individual activists harbingers of important new ideas or a strain on corporate resources?
To what extent should shareholders actively participate in corporate policy? To what extent should they defer to the judgment of directors?

The descriptive analyses show that, while the number of firms claiming Sec. 199 benefits is small, these firms are an economically important subset of all corporate firms and report over half of total positive corporate taxable income. Furthermore, corporations report that approximately $440 billion of taxable income qualifies for the deduction, equal to one-third of all corporate taxable income. Additional analyses show that approximately 72% of the deduction is claimed by large, multinational public firms with assets greater than $1 billion. While described as a tax deduction for domestic producers and manufacturers, only 60% of the deduction is claimed by firms in industries traditionally considered to generate production-related income. The statute has thus been applied widely by a number of firms in other industries who have identified some portion of their business that generates qualifying income.

To select the best ideas, creators and managers must excel at creative forecasting, the skill of predicting the outcomes of new ideas. Using both a field study of 339 professionals in the circus arts industry and a lab experiment, I examine the conditions for accurate creative forecasting, focusing on the effect of creators’ and managers’ roles. In the field study, creators and managers forecasted the success of new circus acts with audiences, and the accuracy of these forecasts was assessed using data from 13,248 audience members. Results suggest that creators were more accurate than managers when forecasting about others’ novel ideas, but not their own. This advantage over managers was undermined when creators previously had poor ideas that were successful in the marketplace anyway. Results from the lab experiment show that creators’ advantage over managers in predicting success may be tied to the emphasis on both divergent thinking (idea generation) and convergent thinking (idea evaluation) in the creator role, while the manager role emphasizes only convergent thinking. These studies highlight that creative forecasting is a critical bridge linking creativity and innovation, shed light on the importance of roles in creative forecasting, and advance theory on why creative success is difficult to sustain over time.",93.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.00935732103596102,False,

The manufacturer may not directly dictate which tier 2 suppliers are used but may influence the sourcing decisions of tier 1 suppliers via contract parameters. The manufacturer’s optimal strategy depends critically on the degree of overlap in the supply chain: if tier 1 suppliers share tier 2 suppliers, resulting in a “diamond-shaped” supply chain, the manufacturer relies less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multisourcing in tier 1) and more on indirect mitigation (inducing tier 1 suppliers to mitigate disruption risk). We also show that while the manufacturer always prefers less overlap, tier 1 suppliers may prefer a more overlapped supply chain and hence may strategically choose to form a diamond-shaped supply chain. This preference conflict worsens as the manufacturer’s profit margin increases, as disruptions become more severe, and as unreliable tier 2 suppliers become more heterogeneous in their probability of disruption; however, penalty contracts—in which the manufacturer penalizes tier 1 suppliers for a failure to deliver ordered units—alleviate this coordination problem.",93.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01634525673147313,False,supply chain disruptions

We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without “sparsity” assumptions. We propose an “honest” approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74% and 84% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7–22%.",93.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.009975968593062854,False,

From the experiment, the greater the harm from the confrontational activist, the higher are the offers to work with the cooperative activist and avoid targeting by the confrontational activist. The self-regulator is favored by the activists and offers less than the profit-maximizer. The confrontational activist also favors the self-regulator by threatening a less aggressive campaign. The intensity of the threat results in a positive externality, and to exploit the externality, donors shift resources from the cooperative activist to the confrontational activist.

This paper explores the benefit of risk pooling in the context of inventory management using the canonical model first studied in Eppen [Eppen GD (1979) Effects of centralization on expected costs in a multi-location newsboy problem. Management Sci. 25(5):498–501]. Specifically, we consider a single-period, multi location news vendor model, where n different locations face independent and identically distributed demands and linear holding and backorder costs. We show that Eppen’s celebrated result, i.e., that the expected cost savings from centralized inventory management scale with the square root of the number of locations, depends critically on the “light-tailed” nature of the demand uncertainty. In particular, we establish that the benefit from pooling relative to the decentralized case, in terms of both expected cost and safety stock, is equal to n(α–1)/α for a class of heavy-tailed demand distributions (stable distributions), whose power-law asymptotic decay rate is determined by the parameter α ∈ (1, 2). Thus, the benefit from pooling under heavy-tailed demand uncertainty can be significantly lower than n‾√n, which is predicted for normally distributed demands. We discuss the implications of this result on the performance of periodic-review policies in multi period inventory management, as well as for the profits associated with drop-shipping fulfillment strategies. Corroborated by an extensive simulation analysis with heavy-tailed distributions that arise frequently in practice, such as power law and log normal, our findings highlight the importance of taking into account the shape of the tail of demand uncertainty when considering a risk pooling initiative.",93.0,School Website,100,Goal 15,0.01046341010828801,False,

How can buyers motivate suppliers to exert greater care to prevent such harm? This paper characterizes a “backfiring condition” under which actions taken by prominent buyers (increasing auditing, publicizing negative audit reports, providing loans to suppliers) motivate a supplier to exert greater effort to pass the buyer’s audit by hiding information, and less care to prevent harm. Intuitively-appealing actions for a buyer (penalizing a supplier for harming workers or the environment, or for trying to deceive an auditor) may be similarly counterproductive. Contrary to conventional wisdom, squeezing a supplier’s margin (by reducing the price paid to the supplier or increasing wages for workers) motivates the supplier to exert greater care to prevent harm—under the backfiring condition. Whereas the necessary and sufficient condition depends on the relative convexity of the supplier’s hiding cost function, a simple sufficient condition is that supplier is likely to successfully hide information from the auditor, in equilibrium. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the backfiring condition is prevalent or increasingly so.

The evidence suggests that this was largely the result of the revelation of (long‐lived) private information and the (transitory) impact of uninformed liquidity trades on intermediaries’ risk premia.

Nevertheless, short-term agreements on emission levels then reduce every country’s payoff, since countries invest less when they anticipate future negotiations. If intellectual property rights are weak, the agreement should be tougher and more long-term. Conversely, if the climate agreement happens to be short-term or absent, intellectual property rights should be strengthened or technological licensing subsidized.",94.0,School Website,100,Goal 13,0.101935780830089,True,Green Climate Fund; climate governance; emissions reduction

Could such an approach — called a lay theory intervention — be effective before college matriculation? Could this strategy reduce a portion of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic achievement gaps for entire institutions? Three double-blind experiments tested this possibility. Ninety percent of first-year college students from three institutions were randomly assigned to complete single-session, online lay theory or control materials before matriculation (n > 9,500). The lay theory interventions raised first-year full-time college enrollment among students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds exiting a high-performing charter high school network or entering a public flagship university (experiments 1 and 2) and, at a selective private university, raised disadvantaged students’ cumulative first-year grade point average (experiment 3). These gains correspond to 31–40% reductions of the raw (unadjusted) institutional achievement gaps between students from disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged backgrounds at those institutions. Further, follow-up surveys suggest that the interventions improved disadvantaged students’ overall college experiences, promoting use of student support services and the development of friendship networks and mentor relationships. This research therefore provides a basis for further tests of the generalizability of preparatory lay theories interventions and of their potential to reduce social inequality and improve other major life transitions.",94.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.04206460666352514,False,

With learning, shirking by the agent both reduces output and lowers the principal’s estimate of future profitability. The agent can exploit this belief discrepancy and earn information rents, reducing his incentives to exert effort. The optimal contract controls information rents to improve incentives by distorting the termination decision. Our results capture the transition from a young, financially constrained firm to a mature firm that pays dividends. For young firms, poor performance permanently raises the termination threshold, as doing so lowers information rents. Mature firms pay smoothed dividends and have a fixed termination threshold. Dividend smoothing occurs because earnings surprises are used to adjust financial slack in line with profitability.

Study 1 found that men (but not women) who wrote about their death reported more interest in acquiring power. Study 2A and Study 2B demonstrated that when primed with reminders of death, men (but not women) reported behaving more dominantly during the subsequent week, while both men and women reported behaving more prosocially during that week. Thus, mortality salience prompts people to respond in ways that help them manage their death anxiety but in ways consistent with normative gender expectations. Furthermore, Studies 3–5 showed that feeling powerful reduces anxiety when mortality is salient.

Policy outcomes as well as campaign finance reforms occur at the legislature level; understanding the systemic rather than individual-level effect of campaign spending is therefore directly relevant. Aggregating estimated effects of individual-level campaign finance would not produce this same estimate owing to spillovers and other strategic dynamics.

Although Blacks constituted 7% of all admitted law school applicants in 2010 and 2011, they constituted a smaller percentage of law school graduates and an even smaller percentage of all practicing attorneys (EEOC report 2003). Black lawyers also face significantly lower odds of making partner in large corporate law firms than white males, even after accounting for the racial composition of associates (EEOC report, 2003: 31).

In this article, the authors focus on one such rigidity: the constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of incentives within the firm. The study’s application is to sales force compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them, leading to a “contractual externality” in the firm and generating gains to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500 company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance firmwide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm’s payoff, relative to a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the composition of its agents. However, a firm’s payoff under a homogeneous plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the firm can optimize both composition and compensation. Thus, in the empirical setting of this study, the ability to choose agents mitigates the loss in incentives from the restriction to uniform contracts. The authors conjecture this result may hold more broadly.",95.0,School Website,100,Goal 12,0.004206216412461028,False,

Consequently, people are often motivated to resolve their ambivalence in various ways. We propose that people sometimes desire to be ambivalent as a means of strategic self-protection. Across employment, educational and consumer choice settings, we demonstrate that when people are uncertain they can obtain a desired target, they will cultivate ambivalence in order to protect their feelings in the event that they fail to get what they want. Specifically, we show that people consciously desire to cultivate ambivalence as a way to emotionally hedge and that they seek out and process information in ways to deliberately cultivate ambivalence. We find that people are most likely to generate ambivalence when they are most uncertain that they can obtain their desired target. Depending on the outcome, this cultivated ambivalence can either be useful (when the desired target is not obtained) or backfire (when the desired target is obtained).",95.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.01684602505720385,False,

In the affirmation intervention, students wrote about a core personal value, an exercise that has been found in previous research to buffer minority students against the stress of being negatively stereotyped in school. This single affirmation improved the college grade point average (GPA) of Latino students over 2 years. Students were re-recruited for a follow-up session near the end of those 2 years. Results indicated that GPA benefits occurred, in part, because the affirmation shifted the way Latino students spontaneously responded to subsequent stressors. In particular, in response to an academic stressor salience task about their end-of-semester requirements, affirmed Latino students spontaneously generated more self-affirming and less self-threatening thoughts and feelings as assessed by an open-ended writing prompt.

This and other status research has tended to assume that status hierarchies are agreed-upon among group members. Here, we build on recent work on status conflict in investigating the prevalence and consequences of situations in which group members hold differing perceptions of the status ordering—that is, of who ranks where—which we call status disagreement. Across two studies of interacting groups, we examined several different types of status disagreement and found that disagreements in which two group members both viewed themselves as higher in status than the other, or upward disagreements, were uniquely harmful for groups. These types of disagreements led the involved members to reduce their contributions to the group, substantially decreasing group performance. However, other forms of dyadic status disagreements, as well as overall levels of status consensus, did not significantly affect group functioning. Furthermore, we found that individuals higher in personality dominance were those most likely to be involved in these harmful upward disagreements. These findings demonstrate the importance of more thoroughly considering status disagreement as a dimension that can vary in quantity and type across groups.

In this paper, we build a model to estimate the excess mortality and incremental health expenditures associated with exposure to the following 10 workplace stressors: unemployment, lack of health insurance, exposure to shift work, long working hours, job insecurity, work–family conflict, low job control, high job demands, low social support at work, and low organizational justice. Our model uses input parameters obtained from publicly accessible data sources. We estimated health spending from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and joint probabilities of workplace exposures from the General Social Survey, and we conducted a meta-analysis of the epidemiological literature to estimate the relative risks of poor health outcomes associated with exposure to these stressors. The model was designed to overcome limitations with using inputs from multiple data sources. Specifically, the model separately derives optimistic and conservative estimates of the effect of multiple workplace exposures on health, and uses optimization to calculate upper and lower bounds around each estimate, which accounts for the correlation between exposures. We find that more than 120,000 deaths per year and approximately 5%–8% of annual healthcare costs are associated with and may be attributable to how U.S. companies manage their work forces.

The Determinants and Welfare Implications of US Workers' Diverging Location Choices by Skill: 1980-2000,Rebecca Diamond,American Economic Review,2016,American Economic Review March2016 Vol. 106 Issue 3 Pages 479-524.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/determinants-welfare-implications-us-workers-diverging-location,"From 1980 to 2000, the rise in the US college/high school graduate wage gap coincided with increased geographic sorting as college graduates concentrated in high wage, high rent cities. This paper estimates a structural spatial equilibrium model to determine causes and welfare consequences of this increased skill sorting. While local labor demand changes fundamentally caused the increased skill sorting, it was further fueled by endogenous increases in amenities within higher skill cities. Changes in cities’ wages, rents, and endogenous amenities increased inequality between high school and college graduates by more than suggested by the increase in the college wage gap alone.",96.0,School Website,100,Goal 10,0.03776129499599272,False,education inequality

This study aims to assess the economic value of fossil-fuel PES which rely on hydrogen as an intermediate product. Our analysis focuses on a representative PES configuration that uses coal as the primary energy input and produces electricity and fertilizer as end-products. We derive a series of propositions that assess the cost competitiveness of the modeled PES under both static and flexible operation modes. The result is a set of metrics that quantify the levelized cost of hydrogen, the unit profit-margin of PES, and the real-option values of ‘diversification’ and ‘flexibility’ embedded in PES. These metrics are subsequently applied to assess the economics of Hydrogen Energy California (HECA), a PES currently under development in California. Under our technical and economic assumptions, HECA’s levelized cost of hydrogen is estimated at 1.373 $/kgh. The profitability of HECA as a static PES increases in the share of hydrogen converted to fertilizer rather than electricity. However, when configured as a flexible PES, HECA almost breaks even on a pre-tax basis. Diversification and flexibility are valuable for HECA when polygeneration is compared to static monogeneration of electricity, but these two real options have no value when comparing polygeneration to static monogeneration of fertilizers.",96.0,School Website,100,Goal 7,0.1069351635181602,True,sustainable energy systems

Emission-accounting standards provide three candidate rules for allocating the supplier’s emissions among its products. This paper shows that under the value-based allocation, imposing an emissions tax on the primary product can increase emissions, by motivating the supplier to lower the price and sell a larger quantity. In contrast, with the socially optimal choice of allocation rule characterized in this paper, imposing the emissions tax on the primary product can greatly reduce emissions and increase welfare. In the absence of climate policy, under value-based allocation, a buyer might achieve greater profit by paying to offset its supply chain emissions. That can motivate supplier innovation to reduce its production cost.

Americans and CEO Pay: 2016 Public Perception Survey on CEO Compensation,"David F. Larcker, Nicholas E. Donatiello, Brian Tayan",CGRI Survey Series,2016,"CGRI Survey Series Corporate Governance Research Initiative, Stanford Rock Center for Corporate Governance February2016",https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/americans-ceo-pay-2016-public-perception-survey-ceo-compensation,"Recently, the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University conducted a nationwide survey of 1,202 individuals — representative by gender, race, age, political affiliation, household income, and state residence — to understand public perception of CEO pay levels among the 500 largest publicly traded corporations. Key takeaways are:

CEOs are vastly overpaid, according to most Americans
Most support drastic reductions
The public is divided on government intervention

74 percent of Americans believe that CEOs are not paid the correct amount relative to the average worker. Only 16 percent believe that they are. While responses vary across demographic groups (e.g., political affiliation and household income), overall sentiment regarding CEO pay remains highly negative.

“There is a clear sense among the American public that CEOs are taking home much more in compensation than they deserve,” says Professor David F. Larcker of Stanford Graduate School of Business. “While we find that members of the public are not particularly knowledgeable about how much CEOs actually make in annual pay, there is a general sense of outrage fueled in part by the political environment.”

“Corporations and their boards need to do a better job explaining and justifying CEO pay arrangements,” adds Nick Donatiello, Lecturer in Corporate Governance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “The vast majority of Americans think CEO pay levels are a problem. Some are comfortable with the idea that CEOs should substantially share in any upside value they create, while many others favor significant reductions in the amount of pay a CEO can receive relative to the average worker. Clearly companies have not been successful communicating how much value their CEO creates and how much compensation is required, given the market for talent, to attract and motivate the right people.”

According to Brian Tayan, researcher at Stanford Graduate School of Business, “Whether high pay packages are deserved is an emotionally charged subject. Whether the government can or should intervene is even more divisive. Public consensus is that there is a problem. There is much less agreement on a solution.”

The controversy over CEO compensation has reached new heights with labor unions, media, and political candidates from both major parties expressing public criticism. According to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the average CEO “is now earning 200 times the average hourly wage. Twenty years ago the ratio was about forty times. People all over this country are really upset about this.” According to Republican candidate Donald Trump, CEO compensation is a “total and complete joke…. they get whatever they want.” On its website, the AFL-CIO cites a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 331:1, adding that “in recent decades, corporate CEOs have been taking a greater share of the economic pie while wages have stagnated and unemployment remains high.” A Bloomberg report claims that “the gap between pay for U.S. chief executive officers and the people who work for them has widened sevenfold in three decades. Are bosses seven times smarter these days? Company boards seem to think so.”1

The findings include the following:

The Average American Grossly Underestimates How Much CEOs Make

Public frustration with CEO pay exists despite a public perception that CEOs earn only a fraction of their published compensation amounts. Disclosed CEO pay at Fortune 500 companies is ten times what the average American believes those CEOs earn. The typical American believes a CEO earns $1.0 million in pay (average of $9.3 million), whereas median reported compensation for the CEOs of these companies is approximately $10.3 million (average of $12.2 million).2

Responses vary based on the household income of the respondent, but all groups underestimate actual compensation. Lower income respondents (below $20,000) believe CEOs earn $500,000 ($9.7 million average), while higher income respondents ($150,000 or more) believe CEOs earn $5,000,000 ($14.9 million average).

Still, Americans Believe CEOs Are Overpaid Relative to the Average Worker

The vast majority (74 percent) of Americans believe that CEOs are not paid the correct amount relative to the average worker. Only 16 percent believe that they are paid an appropriate amount. While responses vary by political affiliation, they remain largely negative. Only a quarter (25 percent) of Republicans believe CEOs are paid the correct amount relative to the average worker, compared to 16 percent of Democrats and 11 percent of Independents.

Nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of Americans believe that there is a maximum amount that CEOs should be paid relative to the average worker, regardless of the company and its performance. Interestingly, a majority of all political groups believe CEO pay should be capped in some manner, though Republicans are somewhat less likely to hold this opinion (52 percent) than Democrats (66 percent) or Independents (64 percent).

Those who believe in capping CEO pay relative to the average worker would do so at a very low multiple. The typical American would limit CEO pay to no more than 6 times (17.6 times, based on average numbers) that of the average worker. These figures are significantly below current pay multiples, which are approximately 210 times based on recent compensation figures.3

“CEO compensation figures are much higher than the public is aware of,” observes Professor Larcker. “In many parts of the country, it is incomprehensible that anyone can earn this much money. It is understandable that any limit on CEO pay would be low for most citizens.”

Opinions Vary on How Much to Pay CEOs for Performance

Public opinion varies widely about the degree to which executives should share in the value created at a company. For example, when respondents are given a hypothetical situation in which a company’s value increases by $100 million over the course of a year, the median respondent believes that the CEO should receive only 0.5 percent ($500,000) as compensation. The mean response is 3.2 percent ($3.2 million). Responses do not vary by political affiliation, with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents willing to share this value in roughly the same proportion.

“This gets to the heart of the issue of ‘pay for performance,’” says Mr. Donatiello. “Either the public is not sold on the idea that CEOs should share in value creation to the extent that they do. Or they do not believe that CEOs play an important role in value creation. Clearly companies need to make a stronger case for how pay is tied to performance — to the extent it is.”

Americans Agree There Is a Problem but Are Split on Whether the Government Should Get Involved

The public strongly believes that CEO compensation is a problem. A large majority (70 percent) hold this opinion, compared with only 18 percent who do not think it is a problem. The view that CEO pay is a problem is substantially more prevalent among those who identify themselves as Democrats (78 percent) and Independents (72 percent) than those who identify themselves as Republicans (54 percent). Perhaps unexpected, low income respondents are less likely to believe that CEO pay is a problem (54 percent) than high income respondents (72 percent).

In terms of a solution, approximately half of respondents (49 percent) believe the government should do something to change current CEO pay practices, approximately one-third (35 percent) do not believe the government should intervene, while the remainder have no opinion.

Higher income respondents (38 percent) are much less likely to favor government intervention than middle income (55 percent) and lower income (52 percent) respondents. Republicans and Independents (36 percent and 47 percent, respectively) are also less likely to favor government intervention than Democrats (60 percent).

Possible Government Actions Vary, None of Which is Widely Supported

Those who favor government intervention support a range of possible actions, although none alone receives majority or even close to near-majority support. Twenty-eight percent of respondents who advocate government intervention would substantially increase taxes on CEO compensation above a certain amount; 25 percent would set a strict limit on the dollar amount a CEO can receive relative to the average worker; 17 percent would limit the absolute dollar amount that a CEO can receive; 17 percent would require more performance-based compensation; 9 percent would ban the use of stock options in executive compensation contracts; and 8 percent would ban the use of all equity compensation in CEO pay packages.

Responses do not vary significantly by income bracket. However, higher income respondents are less likely to support both absolute and relative limits on CEO pay. They are also less likely to support higher taxes on CEO pay.

Responses do vary by political affiliation, with Democrats significantly more likely than Republicans to support each of the interventions listed above.

“The concept of government intervention in restricting or influencing CEO pay is a highly charged,” observes Mr. Tayan. “It is not surprising that viewpoints on government intervention would be split along ideological lines, especially given the current political environment.”

CEOs and Directors on Pay: 2016 Survey on CEO Compensation,"David F. Larcker, John T. Thompson, Nicholas E. Donatiello, Brian Tayan",CGRI Survey Series,2016,"CGRI Survey Series Corporate Governance Research Initiative, Stanford Rock Center for Corporate Governance, Heidrick & Struggles February2016",https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/ceos-directors-pay-2016-survey-ceo-compensation,"Recently, Heidrick & Struggles and the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University and the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University surveyed 107 CEOs and directors of Fortune 500 companies to understand their perception of CEO pay practices among the largest U.S. corporations.

The research finds that public company directors give CEOs considerable credit for corporate success, believing that 40 percent of a company’s overall results, on average, are directly attributed to the CEO’s efforts.

“We find that directors give CEOs considerable credit for corporate performance,” says Professor David F. Larcker of Stanford Graduate School of Business. “While it is difficult to measure a CEO’s contribution to performance, directors take the viewpoint that CEOs are instrumental in the success or failure of an organization. These findings help to explain why CEO pay levels are as high as they are among the biggest U.S. companies: if you believe CEOs are largely responsible for their company’s success, it is understandable that you would want to offer a lot of money to encourage them to be successful.”

Nonetheless, the efforts of directors to align pay and performance are not resonating with the general public. “When most directors think CEO pay is reasonable but most Americans believe that CEO pay is a problem, then you have a serious perception gap,” cautions Nick Donatiello, lecturer in corporate governance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “With more and more of the American public owning stock through retirement accounts, pensions, and mutual funds, public outrage over CEO pay invites legislative or regulatory intervention. Directors need to make the case clearly and convincingly that the pay they offer is not only tied to performance but that it is deserved based on market realities, performance, and the CEO contribution to that performance.”

Corporate Leaders Believe That CEOs Are Paid the Correct Amount (With Some Caveats)

Seventy-six percent of CEOs and directors believe that CEOs are paid correctly, based on the expected value of compensation awards at the time they are granted. CEOs (84 percent) are slightly more likely than directors (71 percent) to have this opinion. Conversely, a sizable minority of directors (25 percent) do not believe that CEOs receive the correct level of pay.

CEOs and directors are somewhat less likely to believe that CEOs receive the correct level of pay based on the amount they realize when compensation awards are earned or converted to cash. Sixty-five percent believe realized pay levels are correct. The decrease in support from expected pay levels is most pronounced among the CEO population, where only 65 percent believe take-home pay levels are correct — a 19 percentage point difference. Twenty-six percent of CEOs and 30 percent of directors do not believe CEOs receive the correct level of take-home pay. Based on their commentary, some respondents believe that some CEOs are paid too much.

CEOs and Directors Believe In “Pay for Performance”…

CEOs and directors overwhelmingly believe that CEO pay is aligned with performance. Ninety-five percent of CEOs and 87 percent of directors believe this to be the case.

More than three-quarters (77 percent) also believe that compensation arrangements contain the correct mix of short- and long-term incentives. Responses do not differ considerably between CEOs and directors. Still, a reasonable minority (21 percent) believe that compensation contracts are too short-term. Almost none (3 percent) believe they are too long-term.

CEOs and directors believe that 75 percent of a CEO’s compensation package should be performance-based (rather than fixed or guaranteed). This figure is largely in line with shareholder preferences and existing pay practices.2

… and Give CEOs a Lot of Credit for Corporate Outcomes

When asked to quantify how much of a company’s performance is directly attributable to the efforts of the CEO, corporate leaders give CEOs considerable credit for corporate outcomes. They believe that CEOs are directly responsible for 30 percent of performance results. Directors give more credit to CEOs for performance than CEOs do themselves, believing that they are directly responsible for 40 percent of performance compared with 30 percent according to CEOs.

Similarly, CEOs and directors give the entire senior management team (which includes the CEO) credit for 60 percent of a company’s performance. Directors again attribute a higher percentage of overall performance to the efforts of senior management (73 percent) than CEOs do (50 percent).

“Contribution to performance is a key element in deciding how much a CEO should be paid: What value did the company create, what contribution did the CEO make to that value creation, and how much of that do you want to share with the CEO as compensation. That is the implicit formula for determining CEO pay,” says Professor Larcker. “Directors believe that CEOs contribute a lot to value creation, and so you can see why they are willing to offer the CEO a lot of money to create that value.”

CEOs and Directors Disagree on Performance Metrics and Discretionary Bonuses

Less consensus exists about measuring and rewarding corporate performance. Directors are twice as likely as CEOs to say that stock price performance (total shareholder return) is the single best measure of company performance (51 percent versus 26 percent). By contrast, CEOs are more likely to believe that profitability measures — operating income and free cash flow — are best (49 percent of CEOs versus 20 of directors).

Furthermore, a surprising number of corporate leaders do not believe that CEO performance targets are difficult to achieve. While 58 percent agree or strongly agree that companies select “very challenging” performance goals for compensation plans, fully 14 percent disagree or strongly disagree. Directors (21 percent) are much more likely than CEOs (5 percent) to think that performance targets are not very challenging.

Similarly, CEOs and directors are mixed on whether it is appropriate to pay discretionary bonuses when targets are missed. Forty-six percent of the combined populations agree or strongly agree that it is appropriate to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the CEO if the company misses performance targets because of factors that the board believes are outside the CEO’s control; 31 percent disagree or strongly disagree. CEOs (53 percent) are more likely to agree than directors (43 percent), but even they are mixed with 25 percent of CEOs disagreeing that discretionary bonuses are appropriate.

“These issues are contentious among shareholders, activists, and other governance experts,” observes John Thompson, vice chairman of Heidrick & Struggles. “It should come as little surprise, therefore, that the divide plays out in the boardroom as well. Indeed, the correct performance measures, the correct targets, and the outcomes necessary for awarding contingent compensation are important elements of discussion, and we see directors actively engaging and debating these topics.”

Equity Should Be Performance-Based, Might Cause “Excessive” Risk

The vast majority of CEOs and directors (90 percent) believe that stock awards should have performance features. A smaller portion (58 percent) believe that stock options should have performance-based vesting features. Directors (63 percent) are much more likely than CEOs (49 percent) to favor performance-based stock options.3

CEOs and directors (83 percent) generally do not believe that stock options lead to excessive risk taking. However, a significant minority of CEOs (24 percent) believe that they do.

“Executives are notably risk averse when it comes to compensation arrangements. It is understandable that CEOs would not want additional performance-based features in their stock option plans if they believe that strike prices, by definition, make options ‘performance-based,’” says Professor Larcker. “Whether stock options cause ‘excessive’ risk taking is much more difficult to determine. Researchers have long noted that options encourage executives to take on more corporate risk. Whether or not these risks are ‘excessive’ is unclear. Most CEOs and directors believe they are not, but even among these individuals there is not consensus.”

CEOs Should Share in Value Creation, but Not Extensively

CEOs and directors generally believe that CEOs should share only modestly in the value they create for shareholders. If a company increases in value by $100 million, the typical CEO and director believes the CEO should receive 1.5 percent ($1.5 million) as compensation.

These figures are not substantially higher than what the general American public says when asked the same question. The typical American would share 0.5 percent ($500,000) with the CEO as compensation. The mean value of responses among both groups is strikingly similar: $3.6 million according to CEOs and directors compared with $3.2 million according to the public.4

Corporate Leaders and the Public Disagree on Compensation Limits, and on Government Intervention

A majority of CEOs and directors (55 percent) believe that CEOs are paid the correct amount relative to the average worker; 29 percent believe they are not; and 16 percent have no opinion. While modest, these numbers are considerably more favorable than the opinion of the American public. Only 16 percent of Americans believe CEOs are paid the correct amount relative to the average worker, and 74 percent believe they are not.5

CEOs and directors strongly disagree that there should be a maximum amount that CEOs are paid, relative to the average worker. Only 12 percent support a relative limit to CEO pay, while 79 percent oppose it. These figures, too, are considerably more favorable than public opinion. Two-thirds of Americans (62 percent) favor capping pay, while 28 percent oppose the concept.

Most CEOs and directors (73 percent) do not believe that CEO compensation is a problem; 25 percent believe that it is. Opinion, however, varies between these two groups. Over a third of directors (34 percent) believe that CEO compensation is a problem, while only 12 percent of CEOs believe it to be so. These figures are much less favorable than public opinion, where over two-thirds (70 percent) of Americans believe that CEO compensation is a problem.

Finally, CEOs and directors almost uniformly agree that the government should not do anything to change CEO pay practices. Ninety-seven percent oppose intervention. The American public is more mixed on this issue, with 49 percent favoring government intervention and 35 percent opposing it.

“The gaps in perception between what directors think and what the public thinks are substantial,” says Donatiello. “Clearly directors are in a better position to judge what compensation is required to attract, retain, and motivate qualified CEO talent in a competitive labor market. But with income inequality being such a hot-button issue today, directors need to be careful that they are not inviting the very government intervention that they say they don’t want. It should be a wakeup call to boards that they need to put more efforts into justifying CEO pay.”

2 Institutional investors believe that 70 percent of CEO compensation should be performance-based. Among the largest 100 publicly traded U.S. corporations, approximately 71 percent of CEO pay is performance-based.

We illustrate the welfare benefit of this subsidy and study how the social costs and benefits change with the duration of industry distress. In our model, two firms engage in socially wasteful competition for survival in a declining industry. Firms differ on two dimensions: exogenous productivity and endogenously chosen amount of debt financing, resulting in a two-dimensional war of attrition. Debt financing increases incentives to exit, which, although costly for the firm, is socially beneficial. These benefits decline as industry distress shortens. Our normative model sheds light on why the debt tax subsidy still persists around the world. Analogously, the model can also rationalize a seemingly ad hoc feature of the U.S. tax system, which subsidizes the conflict of interest between debt and equity regarding firm liquidation.",97.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0369763348123686,False,debt relief; debt restructuring

We provide new evidence linking the CIV factor to income risk faced by households. Our findings are consistent with an incomplete markets heterogeneous agent model.

Ad exchanges are emerging Internet markets where advertisers may purchase display ad placements, in real time and based on specific viewer information, directly from publishers via a simple auction mechanism. Advertisers join these markets with a prespecified budget and participate in multiple second-price auctions over the length of a campaign. This paper studies the competitive landscape that arises in ad exchanges and the implications for publishers’ decisions. The presence of budgets introduces dynamic interactions among advertisers that need to be taken into account when attempting to characterize the bidding landscape or the impact of changes in the auction design. To this end, we introduce the notion of a fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) that is behaviorally appealing and computationally tractable, and in some important cases, it yields a closed-form characterization. We establish that an FMFE approximates well the rational behavior of advertisers in these markets. We then show how this framework may be used to provide sharp prescriptions for key auction design decisions that publishers face in these markets. In particular, we show that ignoring budgets, a common practice in this literature, can result in significant profit losses for the publisher when setting the reserve price.",97.0,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.007848074045432725,False,
Why the Assholes are Winning: Money Trumps All,Jeffrey Pfeffer,Journal of Management Studies,2016,Journal of Management Studies January252016 Vol. 53 Issue 4 Pages 663-669.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/why-assholes-are-winning-money-trumps-all,"In August, 2015, the New York Times published a much-discussed and somewhat controversial article documenting the harsh working conditions facing white-collar employees at Amazon.com (Kantor and Streitfeld, 2015), a description that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and some other ‘Amazonians’ claimed was not accurate. However, there have been numerous other articles and blogs noting Amazon’s high-pressure, competitive culture (e.g., Chow, 2015). And the poor working environment in Amazon’s enormous warehouses, where people suffered workplace stress from productivity pressures and physical conditions that included inadequate ventilation, had already been well-documented (e.g., Cadwalladr, 2013). Importantly, the Times article also correctly noted that Amazon was one of the most admired companies and Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO, was typically high on lists of most admired CEOs.

Bezos and Amazon are not unique in this coexistence of success, including the plaudits of others, with harsh and harmful workplaces. As I have noted (Pfeffer, 2015), the multiple dimensions of corporate performance and reputation are not that highly correlated. For instance, only four companies made both Fortune’s most admired and best places to work lists in 2015.

The juxtaposition of admiration – and, of course, extraordinary financial success in terms of stock price appreciation and wealth creation – coupled with hellish and toxic work arrangements, reinforced a view that had been slowly taking hold: that for all the lofty values and leadership aspirations we profess to hold, there is precious little evidence that real choices and behavior, or even hierarchies of status and awards, reflect what we espouse. Instead, numerous behaviors suggest that it seemingly doesn’t matter what an individual or a company does, to human beings or the environment, as long as they are sufficiently rich and successful. Money, indeed, trumps all. Moreover, because money can serve as a signal of competence and worth, no amount of money is ever enough.

They depend only on the realized quadratic variation of the price process, which can be measured and, importantly, hedged in financial markets using existing securities. Our results also apply directly to a new class of options called timer options. Finally, we argue that the Hannan–Blackwell strategy is path dependent and therefore suboptimal with a finite horizon.

Five studies demonstrate that power without status leads to interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment, both in specific dyadic work relationships and among organizational members more broadly. Study 1 provides initial support for the prediction that employees in low-status/high-power roles engage in more conflict with coworkers than all other combinations of status and power. In Studies 2a and 2b, a yoked experimental design replicated this effect and established low-status/high-power roles as a direct source of the interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment. Study 3 used an experimental manipulation of relative status and power within specific dyadic relationships in the workplace and found evidence of a vicious cycle of interpersonal conflict and demeaning treatment within any dyad that included a low-status/high-power individual. Finally, Study 4 utilized survey and human resource data from a large government agency to replicate the power without status effect on interpersonal conflict and demonstrate that power interacts with subjective status change to produce a similar effect; increasing the status of a high-power role reduces conflict whereas decreasing its status increases conflict. Taken together, these findings offer a role-based account of interpersonal conflict and highlight the importance of making a theoretical distinction between status and power.",97.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.05585851096198699,True,conflict prevention

In smart beta cases, the authors argue that mechanically augmenting the risk model can cause losses by distorting an otherwise-correct factor structure. The authors show that for cases in which asset-specific alpha signals might unexpectedly be related to hidden systematic factors, errors of omission—missing these hidden factors—generally result in larger expected losses in portfolio efficiency than do errors of commission—unintentionally including nonexistent “phantom” factors. When the alpha signals are very noisy, the practice of mechanically augmenting the risk model with a custom risk factor to offset that noise can improve portfolio efficiency. However, in those cases, the custom risk factor has nothing to do with underlying sources of true risk that all investors face, but instead serves as a penalty that in a back-door way tends to adjust for weak quality of the manager’s alphas.",97.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.005504567314613058,False,

Using a profile correlation method, we calculated three types of emotional fit based on self-reported emotions, facial expressions, and physiological responses. We then examined the relationships between emotional fit and individual well-being (depression, life satisfaction) as well as collective aspects of well-being, namely collective self-esteem (one’s evaluation of one’s cultural group) and identification with one’s group. The results revealed that self-report emotional fit was associated with greater individual well-being across cultures. In contrast, culture moderated the relationship between self-report emotional fit and collective self-esteem, such that emotional fit predicted greater collective self-esteem in Asian Americans, but not in European Americans. Behavioral emotional fit was unrelated to well-being. There was a marginally significant cultural moderation in the relationship between physiological emotional fit in a strong emotional situation and group identification. Specifically, physiological emotional fit predicted greater group identification in Asian Americans, but not in European Americans. However, this finding disappeared after a Bonferroni correction.

A key metric that often underlies this recommendation process is the click-through rate (CTR) of candidate articles. Whereas CTR is a measure of instantaneous click likelihood, we analyze the performance improvement that one may achieve by some look ahead that accounts for the potential future path of users. To that end, by using some data of user path history at major media sites, we introduce and derive a representation of content along two key dimensions: clickability, the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. We then propose a class of heuristics that leverage both clickability and engageability, and provide theoretical support for favoring such path-focused heuristics over myopic heuristics that focus only on clickability (no look ahead). We conduct a live pilot experiment that measures the performance of a practical proxy of our proposed class, when integrated into the operating system of a worldwide leading provider of content recommendations, allowing us to estimate the aggregate improvement in clicks per visit relative to the CTR-driven current practice.

Self-Regulation and the Market for Activism,David P.

Activists have leverage because firms must self-regulate before they are targeted, and their self-regulation must deter the activists conditional on being targeted. Activists anticipate gaining more from campaigns against soft (more vulnerable) firms than hard (less vulnerable) firms, so it is more costly for soft firms to forestall the activists, and some risk a campaign but self-regulate to mitigate the probability that the campaign succeeds. Campaigns thus can occur in equilibrium. The threat from activism is the probability that a firm is targeted, and the stronger the threat the fewer campaigns there are because more firms self-regulate to forestall a campaign. Radical activists target harder firms than do moderate activists, and the more radical the activists the more costly it is to forestall them. Some firms are too hard to be threatened by activism and maximize their profits. Firms that are too hard to target directly may be vulnerable to campaigns threatening their supply and distribution chains. Activists and their donors have an incentive to maximize the scope of activism; that is, the breadth of the threat from activism.",98.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.0116454613313237,False,

Early detection provides the opportunity to slow the pace of a condition, and thus help individuals to improve or maintain their quality of life. Additionally, it can lessen the financial burden on health insurers and self-insured employers. As a solution to mitigate the rise in chronic conditions and related costs, an increasing number of employers have recently begun using wellness programs, which typically involve an annual health risk assessment. Unfortunately, these risk assessments have low detection capability, as they should be low-cost and hence rely on collecting relatively few basic biomarkers. Thus one may ask, how can we select a low-cost set of biomarkers that would be the most predictive of multiple chronic diseases? In this paper, we propose a statistical data-driven method to address this challenge by minimizing the number of biomarkers in the screening procedure while maximizing the predictive power over a broad spectrum of diseases. Our solution uses multi-task learning and group dimensionality reduction from machine learning and statistics. We provide empirical validation of the proposed solution using data from two different electronic medical records systems, with comparisons over a statistical benchmark.",98.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.07786519244253381,True,early warning systems

In this work, we propose a class of proactive policies which utilizes future information of potential patient arrivals to effectively manage admissions into an ED while reducing waiting times for patients who are eventually treated. Instead of the standard strategy of waiting for queues to build before diverting patients, the proposed policy utilizes the predictions to identify when congestion is going to increase and proactively diverts patients before things get ‘too bad’. We demonstrate that the proposed policy provides delay improvements over standard policies used in practice. We also consider the impact of errors in the information provided by the predictive models and find that even with noisy predictions, our proposed policies can still outperform (achieving shorter delays while serving the same number of patients) standard diversion policies. If the quality of the predictive model is insufficient, then it is better to ignore the future information and simply rely on real-time, current information for the basis of decision making.

Using data that is representative of the LA County jail system, we build a mathematical model that tracks the flow of individuals during arraignment, pretrial release or detention, case disposition, jail sentence, and possible recidivism during pretrial release, after a failure to appear in court, during non-felony probation and during felony supervision. We assess 64 joint pretrial release and split-sentencing (where low-level felon sentences are split between jail time and mandatory supervision) policies that are based on the type of charge (felony or non-felony) and the risk category as determined by the CA Static Risk Assessment tool, and compare their performance to that of the policy LA County used in early 2014, before split sentencing was in use. In our model, policies that offer split sentences to all low-level felons optimize the key tradeoff between public safety and jail congestion by, e.g., simultaneously reducing the rearrest rate by 7% and the mean jail population by 20% relative to the policy LA County used in 2014. The effectiveness of split sentencing is due to two facts: (i) convicted felony offenders comprised _x0001_ 45% of LA County’s jail population in 2014, and (ii) compared to pretrial release, split sentencing exposes offenders to much less time under recidivism risk per saved jail day.",99.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.008326282322057574,False,

Optimal screening and donor management in a public stool bank,"Abbas Kazerouni, Laura J. Burns, Lawrence M.

Fecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and is being investigated as a treatment for other microbiota-associated diseases. To facilitate these activities, an international public stool bank has been created, which screens donors and processes stools in a standardized manner. The goal of this research is to use mathematical modeling and analysis to optimize screening and donor management at the stool bank.

RESULTS:

Compared to the current policy of screening active donors every 60 days before releasing their quarantined stools for sale, costs can be reduced by 10.3 % by increasing the screening frequency to every 36 days. In addition, the stool production rate varies widely across donors, and using donor-specific screening, where higher producers are screened more frequently, also reduces costs, as does introducing an interim (i.e., between consecutive regular tests) stool test for just rotavirus and C. difficile. We also derive a donor release (i.e., into the system) policy that allows the supply to approximately match an exponentially increasing deterministic demand.

CONCLUSIONS:

More frequent screening, interim screening for rotavirus and C. difficile, and donor-specific screening, where higher stool producers are screened more frequently, are all cost-reducing measures. If screening costs decrease in the future (e.g., as a result of bringing screening in house), a bottleneck for implementing some of these recommendations may be the reluctance of donors to undergo serum screening more frequently than monthly.",99.0,School Website,100,Goal 3,0.01245446849866597,False,

However, research suggests such moral rhetoric is largely ineffective for persuading those who do not already hold one’s position because advocates advancing these arguments fail to account for the divergent moral commitments that undergird America’s political divisions. Building on this, we hypothesize that (a) political advocates spontaneously make arguments grounded in their own moral values, not the values of those targeted for persuasion, and (b) political arguments reframed to appeal to the moral values of those holding the opposing political position are typically more effective. We find support for these claims across six studies involving diverse political issues, including same-sex marriage, universal health care, military spending, and adopting English as the nation’s official language.

We consider a model in which a retail firm announces a pair of declining prices for two selling periods, and customers with heterogeneous valuations each decide whether to buy a unit early, later or never. In this model, if the demand function is linear and its parameters are common knowledge, there never exist any markdown prices that achieve temporal discrimination for any feasible model parameters. Either all buying customers wait, or all buy early. By contrast, if the demand level is unknown, there always exists a temporally discriminating markdown pricing scheme for all feasible model parameters. We derive qualitative insights to the way demand uncertainty and Bayesian updating contribute to temporal discrimination, which broadly apply to nonlinear demand functions as well. We also show that in case of demand uncertainty, there always exists a temporally discriminating pricing scheme that yields a strictly higher profit to the retailer than the optimal static pricing scheme.

Q-Lasso achieves greater accuracy largely by correcting errors of underestimation in which a patient waits for longer than predicted.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of healthy adults who viewed natural or schematic faces with internal parts that were either normally configured or randomly rearranged. Response amplitudes were reduced in the AMG and STS when subjects viewed stimuli whose configuration of parts were digitally rearranged, suggesting that these regions represent the 1st order configuration of face parts. In contrast, response amplitudes in the FFA showed little modulation whether face parts were rearranged or if the natural face parts were replaced with lines.

Advisors also strategically highlighted how they had suffered for their wrongdoing when they were motivated to establish their right to offer advice.

We demonstrate that economic shocks from Chinese import competition — first studied by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson — cause legislators to vote in a more protectionist direction on trade bills but cause no change in their voting on all other bills. At the same time, these shocks have no effect on the reelection rates of incumbents, the probability an incumbent faces a primary challenge, or the partisan control of the district. Though changes in economic conditions are likely to cause electoral turnover in many cases, incumbents exposed to negative economic shocks from trade appear able to fend off these effects in equilibrium by taking strategic positions on foreign-trade bills. In line with this view, we find that the effect on roll-call voting is strongest in districts where incumbents are most threatened electorally. Taken together, these results paint a picture of responsive incumbents who tailor their roll-call positions on trade bills to the economic conditions in their districts.",100.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.05407193004578735,True,economic shocks

Using this data set, I first show that (1) ads significantly increase the likelihood of the consumers purchasing from the advertiser and (2) this increase carries over to future purchase occasions. Importantly, I also find evidence for the spacing effect: the likelihood of a product’s purchase increases if it’s ads are spread apart rather than bunched together, even if spreading apart involves shifting some ads away from the purchase occasion. Accounting for the spacing effect is important to detect the effects of repeated advertising. Because the traditional models of advertising do not explain the data patterns, I build a new memory-based model of how advertising influences consumer behavior. Using a nested test, I reject the restrictions imposed by the canonical goodwill stock model (Nerlove and Arrow, Economica, 29(114):129–142,1962), in favor of the memory-based model I propose.

Necessity of future information in admission control,Kuang Xu,Operations Research,2015,Operations Research September2015 Vol. 63 Issue 5 Pages 1213 - 1226.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/necessity-future-information-admission-control,"We study the necessity of predictive information in a class of queueing admission control problems, where a system manager is allowed to divert incoming jobs up to a fixed rate, in order to minimize the queueing delay experienced by the admitted jobs.

Spencer et al. (2014) [Spencer J, Sudan M, Xu K (2014) Queuing with future information. Ann. Appl. Probab. 24(5):2091–2142.] show that the system’s delay performance can be significantly improved by having access to future information in the form of a look ahead window, during which the times of future arrivals and services are revealed. They prove that, while delay under an optimal online policy diverges to infinity in the heavy-traffic regime, it can stay bounded by making use of future information. However, the diversion polices of Spencer et al. (2014) require the length of the look ahead window to grow to infinity at a nontrivial rate in the heavy-traffic regime, and it remained open whether substantial performance improvement could still be achieved with less future information.

We resolve this question to a large extent by establishing an asymptotically tight lower bound on how much future information is necessary to achieve superior performance, which matches the upper bound of Spencer et al. (2014) up to a constant multiplicative factor. Our result hence demonstrates that the system’s heavy-traffic delay performance is highly sensitive to the amount of future information available. Our proof is based on analyzing certain excursion probabilities of the input sample paths, and exploiting a connection between a policy’s diversion decisions and subsequent server idling, which may be of independent interest for related dynamic resource allocation problems.

Beyond Altruism: Sociological Foundations of Cooperation and Prosocial Behavior,"Brent Simpson, Robb Willer",Annual Review of Sociology,2015,Annual Review of Sociology August2015 Vol. 41 Pages 43-63.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/beyond-altruism-sociological-foundations-cooperation-prosocial,"In explaining the sources of cooperation and prosocial behavior, psychologists, behavioral economists, and biologists often focus on factors internal to the individual, such as altruistic motivations, other-regarding preferences, and prosocial emotions. By contrast, sociologists typically emphasize social forces external to the individual, including norms, reputation systems, and social networks. Here we review evidence for these rules, reputations, and relations, showing that they have powerful and pervasive effects on cooperation and prosocial behavior. Our discussion highlights two emergent themes of the reviewed literature. First, although these classes of sociological mechanisms typically promote cooperation, their presence can also create ambiguity for individuals regarding the reasons for their own and others’ prosocial acts, and that ambiguity can undermine future prosociality in subsequent settings where the mechanisms are absent. Second, altruistic preferences and social mechanisms often interact, such that the causal significance of altruism is attenuated where these mechanisms are present.",101.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.03061524490338463,False,

However, using quantile regression, we find a positive relation between board independence and financial sophistication for low levels of tax avoidance, but a negative relation for high levels of tax avoidance.

My research examines the determinants of judgment and choice within such dilemmas. To do so, I adopt a multi-method approach that includes the use of both laboratory experiments and qualitative field research. The aim of this multi-method approach is to enhance the ecological validity of trust knowledge by investigating both social psychological and organizational processes that influence trust judgments and decisions. The benefits of trust have been amply established in many empirical studies, ranging from laboratory/experimental investigations (Ostrom and Walker, 2003) to field studies in social and organizational settings (Sztompka, 1999). Obtaining the full range of benefits from trust, however, is often problematic in practice (Cook, Levi and Hardin, 2009; Hardin, 2002; Kramer and Cook, 2004). One problem is that the anticipated gains from trust materialize only when social actors happen to be dealing with others (that is, someone willing to reciprocate their own trusting behavior). Misplaced trust – engaging in trusting behavior with individuals who exploit that trust – can be enormously costly. Accordingly, it makes sense for individuals to trust, but only when that trust is likely to be reciprocated by others.",101.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01576268776159279,False,

We show that media coverage of polarization increases citizens’ beliefs that the electorate is polarized.

Health care professionals and consumers can voluntarily report adverse drug events directly to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the drug manufacturer. Serious adverse events (AEs) are defined by the regulation as those involving “death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.” Unexpected AEs are defined as those involving “any adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product.” Serious and unexpected events are classified as expedited, and manufacturers receiving any such reports are mandated to forward them to the FDA “as soon as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar days of the initial receipt of the information.” The regulation also requests that the manufacturer conduct an investigation and forward findings as follow-up reports to the FDA. Previous studies highlighted that reports by manufacturers to the FDA of serious adverse drug events have increased steadily during the past decade. Manufacturer compliance with the regulation to report serious and unexpected AEs to the FDA within 15 calendar days is unknown, although some media coverage has offered anecdotal examples of delays.

Research has shown that musical preferences and personality are linked, yet little is known about other influences on preferences such as cognitive styles. To address this gap, we investigated how individual differences in musical preferences are explained by the empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory. Study 1 examined the links between empathy and musical preferences across four samples. By reporting their preferential reactions to musical stimuli, samples 1 and 2 (Ns = 2,178 and 891) indicated their preferences for music from 26 different genres, and samples 3 and 4 (Ns = 747 and 320) indicated their preferences for music from only a single genre (rock or jazz). Results across samples showed that empathy levels are linked to preferences even within genres and account for significant proportions of variance in preferences over and above personality traits for various music-preference dimensions. Study 2 (N = 353) replicated and extended these findings by investigating how musical preferences are differentiated by E-S cognitive styles (i.e., ‘brain types’). Those who are type E (bias towards empathizing) preferred music on the Mellow dimension (R&B/soul, adult contemporary, soft rock genres) compared to type S (bias towards systemizing) who preferred music on the Intense dimension (punk, heavy metal, and hard rock). Analyses of fine-grained psychological and sonic attributes in the music revealed that type E individuals preferred music that featured low arousal (gentle, warm, and sensual attributes), negative valence (depressing and sad), and emotional depth (poetic, relaxing, and thoughtful), while type S preferred music that featured high arousal (strong, tense, and thrilling), and aspects of positive valence (animated) and cerebral depth (complexity).

Indeed, mirroring the competing arguments in the theoretical literature, a survey of political scientists reveals that roughly equal numbers of respondents predict the effect to be either larger, smaller, or the same in less competitive districts. We employ a new method based on a validated conditional independence assumption that allows us to estimate the effect of incumbency in districts in a window around the threshold as large as 15 percentage points — that is, elections in which the winning candidate secured as much as 57.5% of the two-party vote.

To understand the subsequent decline of intellectual outliers at RAND, we note that success yields a sense of competence, endurance in a competitive world, and the opportunity and inclination to grow. Self-confidence, endurance, and growth produce numerous positive consequences for an organization; but for the most part, they undermine variety.

We lay out three potential explanations for bloodletting’s cultural success:

it was efficient,
it was defended by prestigious sources (in particular ancient physicians)
cognitive mechanisms made it a particularly attractive practice.

To test these explanations, we first review the anthropological data available in eHRAF. These data reveal that bloodletting is practiced by many unrelated cultures worldwide, where it is performed for different indications and in different ways. This suggests that the success of bloodletting cannot only be explained by its medical efficiency or by the prestige of western physicians. Instead, some universal cognitive mechanisms likely make bloodletting an attractive form of therapy.

We further test this hypothesis using the technique of transmission chains. Three experiments are conducted in the U.S., a culture that does not practice bloodletting. Studies 1 and 2 reveal that stories involving bloodletting survive longer than some other common therapies, and that the most successful variants in the experiments are also the most successful variants worldwide.

Studies 1A and 1B showed that participants felt less obligated to reciprocate the favors of others when they imagined themselves in an organizational rather than a personal context, in part because they were less likely to think that people’s motives for helping were genuine and reflected the other’s true character. Study 2 demonstrated that in an organizational context, individuals were more calculative, deciding to reciprocate or not depending on the favor-doer’s anticipated future usefulness. Studies 3 and 4 extended these results using two different behavioral measures of reciprocating. The findings suggest that the norm of reciprocity may be weaker in organizational contexts in part because such settings elicit more contextual rather than personal attributions and more calculative and future-oriented decision frames.",102.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.004608466641064234,False,

We describe a method for assessing personality using an open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain- and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test–retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits.

I test and find support for these hypotheses in a study of new business and law professionals. The results indicate that individuals with an initial advantage in social ties form more extensive networks post entry than those without such an advantage, and that when certainty about quality is high, this effect depends on the quality attributes of the new entrants.

This research provides a novel answer to this question: consumers’ subjective perceptions of goal conflict. The authors show that beyond the number of goals competing for consumers’ time, perceived conflict between goals makes them feel that they have less time. Five experiments demonstrate that perceiving greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained and that stress and anxiety drive this effect. These effects, which generalize across a variety of goals and types of conflict (both related and unrelated to demands on time), influence how consumers spend time as well as how much they are willing to pay to save time. The authors identify two simple interventions that can help consumers mitigate goal conflict’s negative effects: slow breathing and anxiety reappraisal. Together, the findings shed light on the factors that drive how consumers perceive, spend, and value their time.",102.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.05607871798847253,True,conflict prevention

In the current research, we suggest that feelings of financial constraint increase consumers’ concern about the lasting utility of their purchases, which in turn increases their preference for material goods over experiences. The results of seven studies confirm that the consideration of financial constraints shifts consumers’ preferences toward material goods (rather than experiences), and that this systematic shift is due to an increased concern about the longevity of the purchase. This preference shift persists even when the material goods are more frivolous than the experiences, indicating that the effect is not driven by an increased desire for sensible and justifiable purchases. However, the shift toward material purchases disappears when the material good is unusually short lived, further implicating concern about longevity as the key driver of the effect. Finally, the consideration of financial constraints increases preference for material purchases even when the potential memories that experiences can provide are made explicitly salient. Together, these results indicate that financially constrained consumers spend their discretionary money on material purchases as a means of securing long-term consumption utility.",102.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01247400857791562,False,

This expansion reflects in large part a dramatic decline in module prices from over $4 per Watt (W) at the beginning of 2008 to under $0.8/W by the end of 2013. In 2010, Richard Swanson, the founder of SunPower, documented that over the previous three decades the average sales prices of PV modules had conformed closely to a so-called 80% learning curve, that is, module prices declined by close to 20% with every doubling of the cumulative number of modules produced. However, recent solar module prices have not exactly followed the “Swanson curve.” In 2008 and 2009, module prices were above the benchmark predicted by the learning curve, a phenomenon widely attributed to a temporary shortage of polysilicon. Then, beginning in 2011, the situation reversed: price declines have been noticeably steeper than those predicted by the learning curve. This observation has raised several questions among industry analysts. Did these steep declines reflect accelerated cost reductions or potentially excessive additions to manufacturing capacity in recent years? Further, what price dynamics can be expected going forward, and what do these trends imply for public policy support for solar power?",102.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.01047202854803208,False,

We investigated the impact of vertical integration on hospital prices, volumes (admissions), and spending for privately insured patients. Using hospital claims from Truven Analytics MarketScan for the nonelderly privately insured in the period 2001–07, we constructed county-level indices of prices, volumes, and spending and adjusted them for enrollees’ age and sex. We measured hospital-physician integration using information from the American Hospital Association on the types of relationships hospitals have with physicians. We found that an increase in the market share of hospitals with the tightest vertically integrated relationship with physicians—ownership of physician practices—was associated with higher hospital prices and spending.

The skills, resources, and experience of directors are not sufficient to meet the needs of most nonprofit organizations.

Board processes fall short.

Over a quarter of nonprofit directors do not have a deep understanding of the mission and strategy of their organization. Nearly a third are dissatisfied with the board’s ability to evaluate organizational performance. A majority do not believe their fellow board members are very experienced or engaged in their work.

“Many nonprofit organizations pursue worthy missions,” says David F. Larcker, James Irvin Miller Professor of Accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business and coauthor of the study. “Our research finds that, unfortunately, too often board members lack the skill set, the depth of knowledge, and the engagement required to help their organizations succeed. Nonprofit boards would greatly benefit from a more rigorous process for setting goals and measuring performance.”

“Nonprofit organizations need to do a better job attracting board members with substantive, relevant experience who will deeply and personally embrace the mission of the organization,” adds William F. Meehan III, Lafayette Partners Lecturer for 2013-2015 in Strategic Management at Stanford Graduate School of Business and coauthor of the study. “They need individuals with the depth of knowledge to set explicit goals, develop sound strategies, and hold the executive director or CEO accountable for performance.”

“Individuals join nonprofit boards because they want to make a difference and contribute to the mission of the organization,” adds Nick Donatiello, Lecturer in Corporate Governance at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Holding personal financial contributions aside, the biggest contribution they can make is to help their board implement sound governance practices: reliable financial reporting, concrete organizational performance targets, CEO performance evaluation, board development and succession plans, and fulfilling other basic and fundamental obligations that come with directorship.”

“This extensive survey provides highly informative empirical data which underscores what many of us have been observing based on personal experience. In order for a nonprofit to achieve great impact, it needs a great board. And most nonprofit boards fall far short,” adds Meehan.

Key Findings
Too Many Directors Lack a Deep Understanding of the Organization

Over a quarter (27 percent) of nonprofit directors do not believe that their fellow board members have a strong understanding of the mission and strategy of their organization. A third (32 percent) are not satisfied with the board’s ability to evaluate the performance of the organization.

While almost all (92 percent) say that their board reviews data and information to evaluate organizational performance, many are not comfortable with the quality of that data. Forty-six percent of directors have little to no confidence that the data they review fully and accurately measures the success of their organization in achieving its mission. Over half (57 percent) of nonprofit boards do not benchmark their performance against a peer group of similar organizations. “Rigorous performance measurement is the bedrock of good governance,” says Meehan. “How can the board claim to understand whether its initiatives are successful unless it is measuring their impact? Start with a mission-focused theory of change. Outline a logic model that shows a clear connection between your initiative and the desired outcome. And then rigorously measure performance.”

Most Lack Formal Governance Structure and Processes

Nonprofit boards stand to gain from the adoption of sound governance practices in areas such as financial reporting and audit, succession planning, and CEO and board evaluations. A significant minority (42 percent) do not have an audit committee. Many rely on monthly bank statements to monitor financial performance.

Two thirds (69 percent) do not have a succession plan in place for the current executive director or CEO. Three quarters (78 percent) could not immediately name a successor if the current executive director or CEO were to leave the organization tomorrow. On average, nonprofit directors estimate that it would take 90 days to find a permanent replacement.

Most (80 percent) claim to formally evaluate the performance of the executive director. However, a significant number (39 percent) do not establish explicit performance targets against which his or her performance is measured.

Over a third (36 percent) of nonprofit boards never evaluate their own performance.

Many Directors Are Not Engaged, Do Not Understand Their Obligations

Two-thirds (65 percent) do not believe that the directors on their board are very experienced, based on the number of additional boards they serve on. Almost half (48 percent) do not believe that their fellow board members are very engaged in their work, based on the time they dedicate to their organization and their reliability in fulfilling their obligations.

About half (47 percent) of nonprofit directors believe that their fellow board members understand their obligations as directors well or very well.

Fundraising Is Seen as a Central Obligation

Nonprofit directors rank fundraising very high relative to their other obligations as directors. Forty-five percent of nonprofits require directors to fundraise on behalf of the organization. Among those that do, 90 percent of directors believe that fundraising is as important or more important than their other obligations as directors.

While many nonprofit organizations (46 percent) do not require directors to donate each year, almost all directors (92 percent) personally do so.

Less than half (42 percent) of nonprofits have a “give or get” policy that requires each board member to donate a minimum amount each year or raise that amount from others. The minimum “give or get” varies by size of the organization, and averages $1,000 for small nonprofits (operating budget less than or equal to $500,000) and $5,000 for large nonprofits (operating budget greater than or equal to $5 million).

“Fundraising is an important obligation for many directors,” observes Donatiello. “However, it should not distract from other core duties, such as ensuring that the organization is well managed, the strategy sound, finances healthy, and contingency plans in place to deal with unexpected disruptions.”

Most Directors Are Satisfied with the Performance of Their Executive Director/CEO

Almost all directors (92 percent) believe that the executive director understands the mission and strategy of the organization very or extremely well. Eighty-seven percent are satisfied with his or her performance. Few believe that their executive director is overcompensated, with 51 percent stating that their executive director is appropriately paid and 42 percent stating that he or she is slightly or very underpaid.

Executive directors primarily have previous work experience in the nonprofit sector. Over half (59 percent) worked in the nonprofit industry immediately prior to becoming the head of their organization. Only 14 percent had immediate prior work experience in a for-profit organization. Twelve percent are the founder of their organization. In terms of education, almost two thirds (60 percent) have a master’s degree or higher.

… and with the Performance of Their Board and Organization

A significant majority (85 percent) of nonprofit directors are moderately or very satisfied with the performance of their organization. Satisfaction levels are also high for the quality of financial reporting (82 percent) and financial health (70 percent) of the organization.

Most directors believe their board is correctly sized (56 percent) or only slightly too large (12 percent) or slightly too small (24 percent). These results hold true across organizations of various size.

Approximately half (52 percent) say that their organization has a “board within a board” where a subset of directors has an outsized influence on board decisions. Two thirds of these (67 percent) are a formal executive committee, while one third (33 percent) reflect an informal dynamic that evolved over time. Among those organizations with a “board within a board,” 74 percent say it improves board functionality and decision making.

A quarter (28 percent) of directors report that the founder of the organization currently serves as a fellow board member. Of these, 68 percent say that the founder is very involved in management and 78 percent say the founder is very involved as a board member of the organization. The vast majority (90 percent) believe that the founder has a positive or very positive impact on the success of the organization.

Still, Most Nonprofit Boards Have Serious Challenges

Over two thirds (69 percent) of nonprofit directors say their organization has faced one or more serious governance-related problems in the past 10 years. Forty percent say they have been unable to meet fundraising targets. Twenty-nine percent have experienced serious financial difficulty. A quarter (23 percent) have asked their executive director to leave or had to respond to an unexpected resignation. Sixteen percent say they have had extreme difficulty attracting qualified new board members.

“The value of good governance shows up in results,” says Professor Larcker. “Ultimately, nonprofits will want to implement more reliable processes and procedures to ensure their organizations succeed. Good governance will almost certainly help nonprofit directors maximize their contribution to their social mission.”

To improve governance and board-level performance, the authors recommend that nonprofits incorporate the following:

Ensure your organization’s mission is focused and its skills and resources are well-aligned with it.
Ensure your mission is understood and embraced by the board, management, and other key stakeholders.
Establish explicit goals and strategies directly tied to achieving your mission.
Develop rigorous performance metrics that reflect those goals and strategies.
Hold the executive director accountable for meeting those performance metrics and evaluate his or her performance with a sound, objective process.
Compose your board with individuals with the skills, resources, generosity, diversity, and dedication that address the needs of the organization. This includes ensuring that there is a small group of committed and cohesive leaders.
Define explicitly the roles and responsibilities of board members to best leverage their leadership, time, and resources.
Establish well-defined board, committee, and ad hoc processes that reflect your organization’s needs and context and ensure optimal handling of key decisions and responsibilities.
Regularly review and assess each board member’s leadership contributions as well as the board’s overall performance. This includes ensuring that board members view their time as well spent.",103.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0239532509381109,False,global governance

In the current research, we hypothesized that exposure to the concept of God can actually increase people’s willingness to engage in certain types of risks. Across seven studies, reminders of God increased risk taking in nonmoral domains. This effect was mediated by the perceived danger of a risky option and emerged more strongly among individuals who perceive God as a reliable source of safety and protection than among those who do not. Moreover, in an eighth study, when participants were first reminded of God and then took a risk that produced negative consequences (i.e., when divine protection failed to materialize), participants reported feeling more negatively toward God than did participants in the same situation who were not first reminded of God.

Exchange rates are sensitive to imbalances in financial markets and seldom perform the shock absorption role that is central to traditional theoretical macroeconomic analysis.

The costs create an incentive for local politicians and their affiliated firms to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about the companies. The result will be fewer stock price crashes for the affiliated firms during these event windows, followed by an increase in crashes after the event. Consistent with these predictions, we find that the affiliated firms experience a reduction (an increase) in negative stock return skewness before (after) the event. These effects are strongest in the three-month period directly preceding the event, among firms that are more politically connected, and when the province is dominated by faction politics and cronyism.

The standard solution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is well known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players increases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where players optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others’ states remains constant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we provide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a parsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that guarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation property to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces. Second, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market structure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE well, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate this connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples. These examples show that our conditions enforce a form of “decreasing returns to larger states;” this yields fragmented industries in the SE limit. By contrast, violation of these conditions suggests “increasing returns to larger states” and potential market concentration. In that sense, our work uses a fully dynamic framework to also contribute to a longstanding issue in industrial organization: understanding the determinants of market structure in different industries.",103.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.02147194196743683,False,

Specifically, when target firms have higher-quality accounting information, acquirer returns around the acquisition announcement are higher and target returns are lower—consistent with acquirers capturing a greater portion of acquisition gains by paying less for target firms.

2015 Investor Survey: Deconstructing Proxy Statements — What Matters to Investors,"David F. Larcker, Ronald Schneider, Brian Tayan, Aaron Boyd","Stanford University, RR Donnelley, and Equilar",2015,"Stanford University, RR Donnelley, and Equilar February2015",https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/2015-investor-survey-deconstructing-proxy-statements-what-matters,"In the fall of 2014, RR Donnelley, Equilar, and the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University surveyed 64 asset managers and owners with a combined $17 trillion in assets to understand how institutional investors use the information in corporate proxies to make voting and investment decisions.

Only 38 percent of institutional investors believe that corporate disclosure about executive compensation is clear and easy to understand.

“Shareholders want to know that the size, structure, and performance targets used in executive compensation contracts are appropriate,” says Professor David F. Larcker of Stanford GSB. “Our research shows that, across the board, they are dissatisfied with the quality and clarity of the information they receive about compensation in the corporate proxy. Even the largest, most sophisticated investors are unhappy.”

“With new pressure from activist investors and annual ‘Say on Pay’ (SOP) votes, it is more important than ever that companies explain to their shareholder base why the compensation packages they offer are appropriate in size and structure,” says Aaron Boyd, Director of Governance Research at Equilar.

“Investors are noticing the wide range in quality and clarity among various companies’ proxies. They want companies to communicate and explain, rather than simply disclose,” adds Ron Schneider, Director of Corporate Governance Services at RR Donnelley Financial Services Group. “This represents a significant opportunity for many companies to improve the clarity of their proxies.”

Key findings include:

Investors are Deeply Dissatisfied with Compensation Disclosure

Less than half (38 percent) of institutional investors believe that information about executive compensation is clear and effectively disclosed in the corporate proxy. Responses are consistently negative across all elements of compensation disclosure. Sixty-five percent say that the relation between compensation and risk is “not at all” clear. Forty-eight percent say that it is “not at all” clear that the size of compensation is appropriate. Forty-three percent believe that it is “not at all” clear whether performance-based compensation plans are based on rigorous goals.

Significant minorities cannot determine whether the structure of executive compensation is appropriate (39 percent), cannot understand the relation between compensation and performance (25 percent), and cannot determine whether compensation is well-aligned with shareholder interests (22 percent). “Corporations must do a better job of articulating the rationale behind plan design,” says Mr. Boyd. “It is not enough that disclosure in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (CD&A) section of the proxy meets regulatory requirements. Companies should take renewed effort to be clear and concise in explaining their choices.”

Proxies are Too Long and Difficult to Read; Investors Rely on Only a Small Fraction of the Information

Fifty-five percent of investors believe that a typical proxy statement is too long. Forty-eight percent believe that a typical proxy is difficult to read and understand. Investors claim to read only 32 percent of a typical proxy, on average. They report that the ideal length of a proxy is 25 pages, compared to the actual average of 80 pages among companies in the Russell 3000. “Lengthy disclosure does not necessarily equate with clear and digestible disclosure, and can actually impede rather than improve shareholder understanding of governance choices” observes Mr. Schneider. “Plain English language which is well-organized and easily navigated, coupled with simple design elements to draw the reader to key content, are much more effective in conveying information.”

Investors are most satisfied with disclosure relating to director nominee descriptions and qualifications, director independence, and shareholder-sponsored proposals. They believe that disclosure relating to pay ratios (the ratios of CEO pay to median employee pay and CEO pay to other named executive officer pay), corporate political contributions, corporate social responsibility and sustainability, and CEO succession planning are least clear.

Investors Believe the Proxy Voting Process is a Valuable Exercise …

Eighty percent of investors believe that proxy voting increases shareholder value. Their confidence level that proxy voting increases value averages 7.2 on a scale of 1 to 10, with nearly a quarter of respondents (24 percent) assigning a confidence level of 10. Institutional investors are most likely to read the summary section of the proxy (if included), total compensation tables, and disclosure on long-term incentive plans. Investors also highly value a table highlighting significant changes from the previous year. For proxy voting decisions, investors rely most heavily on disclosure relating to pay-for-performance alignment, performance metrics used in compensation plans, and director independence.

In addition to proxy statements, investors are most likely to rely on internal policies or analysis (73 percent), third-party proxy advisors (63 percent), and direct engagement with the company (58 percent) to make voting decisions.

…However, Portfolio Managers are Only Moderately Involved in Voting Decisions

Seventy-six percent of institutional investors report that portfolio managers are involved in voting specific proxy items for the companies their organization is invested in. However, among those portfolio managers that do participate in voting decisions, the level of engagement is very low. A typical portfolio manager is involved in only 20 percent of voting decisions. Among large institutional investors [assets under management (AUM) greater than $100 billion] engagement is even lower: portfolio managers are involved in only 10 percent of decisions.

Portfolio managers that participate in voting tend to weigh in on major issues: mergers and acquisitions (89 percent), director nominations in a contested election (82 percent), executive compensation “say on pay” (75 percent), and proposals to approve or amend equity compensation plans (70 percent).

Two-thirds of respondents (68 percent) report that portfolio managers are involved in establishing their firm’s proxy voting guidelines.

Proxies are Less Frequently Used for Investment Decisions

Fifty-nine percent of investors use proxy information for investment decisions. In making investment decisions, they rely most heavily on disclosure relating to performance metrics used in compensation plans, pay-for-performance alignment, the corporate governance profile of the firm (including shareholder rights and anti-takeover measures), and risk oversight.

Investors are Lukewarm that “Say on Pay” Leads to Tangible Improvement

A slight majority (54 percent) of shareholders believes that proxies allow them to make informed votes on executive compensation (“Say on Pay”). A similar percentage (58 percent) believes that “say on pay” is effective in influencing or modifying pay practices.

Complaints about disclosure might be related to dissatisfaction with pay practices in general. Only one-fifth (21 percent) of institutional investors believe that CEO compensation among companies in their portfolio is appropriate in size and structure. Twenty-one percent believe that CEO compensation among companies in their portfolio is clearly linked to performance. Only a quarter (26 percent) are able to understand the payouts that executives stand to receive under long-term performance plans.

“These are significantly negative perceptions of executive compensation,” observes Professor Larcker. “’Say on Pay’ is having some effect, engaging shareholders in a discussion about plan design. However, investors are still frustrated with pay levels overall and whether the packages awarded today are justified.”

Home working led to a 13% performance increase, of which 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter and more convenient working environment). Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction, and their attrition rate halved, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to reselect between the home and office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22%.

This shift in the relationship further influenced consumers’ interaction with others, such as the sharing of helpful tips and information.

In Study 2, we observed that a general sense of powerlessness was positively correlated with the perceived legitimacy of the economic system.

We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997–2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants.",104.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.01445631204137559,False,

The creation aspect has captured the dominant attention of researchers, commentators, and policy makers. Destruction, despite its large magnitude, has long been a backwater of research and most commentary on this sector. Destruction is not simply non-growth but rather prior growth that is subsequently reversed. This paper analyzes creation and destruction evidence across 10 different countries and across eight different major industry groups. Yearly growth/decline rates using revenues and headcount for Years 2 to 5 are analyzed. In each of the three growth years examined there are large amounts of destruction as well as creation simultaneously occurring. For example, in Year 5 gross revenue destruction is 34% of gross revenue creation whilst gross job destruction is 65% of gross job creation. A small percentage of companies accounts for a large percentage of the total job and revenue destruction each year. This small percentage of large destroyers is especially interesting because they had to have had, by necessity, prior sizable creation. This rapid rise and subsequent rapid fall has been very much ignored in the research literature. Regression analysis highlights this aspect for the sample of destroyers. The diverse sources of revenue and job destruction are discussed and potential fruitful research directions highlighted.",104.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.03825459659050921,False,GDP growth; economic growth

We examined the diffusion of these drugs in fee-for-service Medicare and Veterans Affairs (VA) systems during 2005–11, in part to assess the impact that differing financial incentives had on prescribing. Physicians treating Medicare patients have a direct financial incentive to prescribe the more expensive agent (ranibizumab), while VA physicians do not. Medicare injections of the more expensive ranibizumab peaked in 2007 at 47 percent. Beginning in 2009 the less expensive bevacizumab became the predominant therapy for Medicare patients, accounting for more than 60 percent of injections.

The price difference between leaseholds and freeholds reflects the present value of perpetual rental income starting at leasehold expiration, and is thus informative about very long-run discount rates. We estimate the price discounts for varying leasehold maturities compared to freeholds and extremely long-run leaseholds via hedonic regressions using proprietary data sets of the universe of transactions in each country. Households discount very long-run cash flows at low rates, assigning high present value to cash flows hundreds of years in the future.

However, the effectiveness of this approach is compromised when healthcare providers cannot ensure a tight seal between an infant’s nose and the mask that delivers the pressurized air. Recognizing that healthcare providers need a low-cost way to create a better seal without having to reinvest in all-new equipment, the AdaptAir team developed a silicone adapter for the nasal cannula.

While physicians in Bangladesh responded favorably to the adapter during early field testing, AdaptAir quickly encountered challenges in trying to establish a company to further develop and commercialize the device. Licensing seemed like a more feasible alternative to get the product to market, but prospective partners wanted AdaptAir to provide them with a market-ready product that they could bundle with their own bubble CPAP equipment.

Prior efforts at providing a unified theory that can accommodate these patterns as special cases have not dealt properly with obsolescence. We tackle this problem by proposing a new model that builds on the most recent unification attempt while integrating the core intuition behind obsolescence: organizations have trouble adapting to drifting environments, which leads to declining performance and, in turn, to decreasing viability. In doing so, we develop a comprehensive representational framework to precisely characterize obsolescence. Our perspective builds on recent theory and research that treats categories as constructions by audiences. We characterize environmental drift as changing audience tastes in a multidimensional feature space and organizational inertia as a decreasing ability for producers to move quickly in that space. This combination creates obsolescence with aging. We then integrate this perspective with prior theory to make novel predictions regarding the age dependence in life chances over the life courses of organizations. We also show how the predictions of our theory can be tested empirically by adapting Levinthal’s random walk model [Levinthal DA (1991) Random walks and and organizational mortality. Admin. Sci.

Analyzing the nutrition-disease nexus: the case of malaria,"Milinda Lakkam, Lawrence M. Wein",Malaria Journal,2015,Malaria Journal 2015 Vol. 14 Issue 479,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/analysing-nutrition-disease-nexus-case-malaria,"Background

Motivated by the observation that children suffering from undernutrition are more likely to experience disease and are more likely to die if they do contract a disease, mathematical modelling is used to explore the ramifications of targeting preventive disease measures to undernutritioned children.

Methods

A malaria model is constructed with superinfection and heterogeneous susceptibility, where a portion of this susceptibility is due to undernutrition (as measured by weight-for-age z scores); so as to isolate the impact of supplementary food on malaria from the influence of confounding factors, the portion of the total susceptibility that is due to undernutrition is estimated from a large randomized trial of supplementary feeding. Logistic regression is used to estimate mortality given malaria infection as a function of weight-for-age z scores. The clinical malaria morbidity and malaria mortality are analytically computed for a variety of policies involving supplementary food and insecticide-treated bed nets.

Results

The portion of heterogeneity in susceptibility that is due to undernutrition is estimated to be 90.3 %. Targeting insecticide-treated bed nets to undernutritioned children leads to fewer malaria deaths than the random distribution of bed nets in the hypoendemic and mesoendemic settings. When baseline bed net coverage for children is 20 %, supplementary food given to underweight children is estimated to reduce malaria mortality by 7.2–22.9 % as the entomological inoculation rate ranges from 500 to 1.0. In the hyperendemic setting, supplementary food has a bigger impact than bed nets, particularly when baseline bed net coverage is high.

Conclusions

Although the results are speculative (e.g., they are based on parameter estimates that do not possess the traditional statistical significance level), the biological plausibility of the modelling assumptions and the high price-sensitivity of demand for bed nets suggest that free bed net distribution targeted to undernutritioned children in areas suffering from both undernutrition and malaria (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa) should be the subject of a randomized trial in a hypoendemic or mesoendemic setting.",105.0,School Website,100,Goal 2,0.08436543702792039,True,malnutrition

With this objective in mind, consumer psychologists have long emphasized the importance of understanding attitudes. Attitudes refer to the general and relatively enduring evaluations people have of other people, objects, or ideas.  Stated differently, attitudes represent the extent to which one likes or dislikes something—for example, a product, company, or brand. Because attitudes can be one of the core drivers of consumer behavior (e.g., choosing one product over another, purchasing now versus later, spending more versus less, and so on), they have been the subject of considerable scrutiny in consumer psychology. Not surprisingly, perhaps, consumer psychologists have been especially interested in understanding the means by which consumers’ attitudes can be shaped or changed, particularly in the context of persuasive messages. 

In this chapter, we provide an overview of past, present, and future research on attitude change and persuasion. More specifically, we (1) review some of the classic research on persuasion to provide an overview of this area, (2) highlight what we view as some of the crucial recent developments in this field, and then (3) discuss several unanswered questions and opportunities for future research.

The degree of concentration is highly variable, as there is substantial variation in firms’ hiring strategies. Two main drivers of variation in law school concentration occur within law offices. First, geography drives a large amount of concentration, as most firms hire largely from local schools.

Conceptualized as such, majoritarianism may be studied as a manipulable phenomenon that, in large part, defines the degree of consensus that a voting organization demands of itself in making decisions about rules, amendments, and law. Majoritarianism is often a central concern in institutional reforms that reallocate individual procedural rights to members. Majoritarian tension inevitably arises among decision-makers due to their simultaneous and conflicting desires for consensus (widespread endorsement of a decision), timeliness (rapid action), and wisdom (prudent, informed decision-making). Two broad empirical expectations based on the majoritarian-tension framework are assessed by revisiting of the extensively studied, so-called Reed Revolution in the late 19th Century House of Representatives.

However, in five studies conducted across different experimental contexts and different content domains, the current research reveals that interruptions that temporarily disrupt a persuasive message can increase consumers’ processing of that message. As a result, consumers can be more persuaded by interrupted messages than they would be by the exact same messages delivered uninterrupted. In documenting this effect, the current research departs from past research illuminating the negative effects of interruptions, and delineates the mechanism through which and conditions under which momentary interruptions can promote persuasion.",106.0,School Website,100,Goal 9,0.007897634094370243,False,
Position Effects in Search Advertising and their Moderators: A Regression Discontinuity Approach,"Sridhar Narayanan, Kirthi Kalyanam",Marketing Science,2015,Marketing Science 2015 Vol. 34 Issue 3 Pages 388-407.,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/measuring-position-effects-search-advertising-regression-discontinuity,"We investigate the causal effect of position in search engine advertising listings on outcomes such as click-through rates and sales orders. Because positions are determined through an auction, there are significant selection issues in measuring position effects. A simple mean comparison of outcomes at two positions is likely to be biased due to these selection issues. Additionally, experimentation is rendered difficult in this situation by competitors’ bidding behavior, which induces selection biases that cannot be eliminated by randomizing the bids for the focal advertiser. Econometric approaches to address the selection are rendered infeasible due to the difficulty of finding suitable instruments in this context. We show that a regression discontinuity (RD) approach is feasible to measure causal effects in this important context. We apply the approach to a large and unique data set of daily observations containing information on a focal advertiser as well as its major competitors. Our RD estimates demonstrate that there are significant selection biases in the more naive estimates. While a mean comparison of outcomes across positions would indicate very large position effects, we find that our RD estimates of these effects are much smaller, and exist only in some of the positions. We further investigate moderators of these effects. Position effects are stronger when the advertiser is smaller, and when the consumer has low prior experience with the keyword for the advertiser. They are weaker when the keyword phrase has specific brand or product information, when the ad copy is more specific as in exact matching options, and on weekends compared to weekdays.",106.0,School Website,100,Goal 17,0.0030557044814526,False,

Rather than reflecting privileged legitimacy, we find that this protective effect is explained by religious protesters’ use of less threatening tactics at events. When religion is disaggregated into different traditions, only mainline and black Protestant groups have lower rates of policing than secular groups. As with the general religion finding, the buffering effect these traditions have on policing is mediated by protester tactics. Moreover, we find that fundamentalist Christians are more likely to be policed than are secular activists when threatening tactics are included. Finally, when actors associated with non-Christian religions engage in extremely confrontational tactics, they are more likely to provoke a police response than are similarly behaving secular groups.",106.0,School Website,100,Goal 1,0.01511237559597413,False,
Quality vs. Variety: Trading Larger Screens for More Shows in the Era of Digital Cinema,"Anita Rao, Wesley R.

Recent advances have enabled exhibitors to satisfy consumers’ long-standing desire for increasingly larger screens. On the other hand, digital technology has reduced the cost of playing the same movie on multiple screens, thereby creating an incentive for screen proliferation to increase the number of show times for a given movie. Increasing the screens also has the added benefit of allowing the exhibitor to expand the number of unique movies screened at a given time. This is fundamentally a tradeoff between quality (larger screen size) and variety (more movies or showings). The goal of this paper is to evaluate consumers’ relative valuations of the large screens vs. more shows tradeoff. We use a new data set on movie showings in India at the movie-chain market-week level to estimate an aggregate discrete-choice demand model providing measures of customer preferences for the number of movie showings and screen size. India provides a valuable setting to study this question because the densely populated cities face substantial space constraints and regional heterogeneity in tastes and languages suggest the option of more shows may be more important in some cities than others. Our findings suggest that regions which are more urban and have a greater share of people with higher education prefer larger screens (quality) while most other regions prefer more showings (variety).",107.0,School Website,100,Goal 11,0.0551543067565415,True,urban expansion

LIBOR is often used as a benchmark rate- meaning that the interest rates that consumers and businesses pay on trillions of dollars in loans adjust up and down contractually based on movements in LIBOR. Investors also rely on the difference between LIBOR and various risk-free interest rates as a gauge of stress in the banking system. Benchmarks such as LIBOR therefore play a central role in modern financial markets. Thus, news reports in 2008 revealing widespread manipulation of LIBOR threatened the integrity of this benchmark and lowered trust in financial markets. We begin with a discussion of the economic role of benchmarks in reducing market frictions. We explain how manipulation occurs in practice, and illustrate how benchmark definitions and fixing methods can mitigate manipulation. We then turn to an overall policy approach for reducing the susceptibility of LIBOR to manipulation before focusing on the practical problem of how to make an orderly transition to alternative reference rates without raising undue legal risks.",107.0,School Website,100,Goal 8,0.01767648738189717,False,

Shareholder Wealth Maximization as Means to an End,Robert P. Bartlett,Seattle University Law Review,2015,Seattle University Law Review 2015 Vol. 38 Issue 2,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/shareholder-wealth-maximization-means-end,"In several recent cases, the Delaware Chancery Court has emphasized that where a conflict of interest exists between holders of a company’s common stock and holders of its preferred stock, the standard of conduct for directors requires that they strive to maximize the value of the corporation for the benefit of its common stockholders rather than for its preferred stockholders. This article interrogates this view of directors’ fiduciary duties from the perspective of incomplete contracting theory. Building on the seminal work of Sanford Grossman and Oliver Hart, incomplete contracting theory examines the critical role of corporate control rights for addressing conflicts that arise between a firm’s investors so as to maximize firm value. It therefore provides a natural starting point for examining how the control rights residing in a company’s board of directors should be used for resolving conflicts between common and preferred stockholders.

This analysis highlights the utility of a default fiduciary duty that prioritizes common stockholder welfare for maximizing the value of the corporation. In particular, such a duty helps facilitate Coasian bargaining among investors to resolve unanticipated conflicts that can arise while also minimizing the risk of bargaining failure. Critically, however, a dictate for directors to maximize stockholder welfare can operate in this fashion only to the extent it exists as a default rule that a director can opt out of when elected to represent the interests of a particular investor or group of investors, as is common among preferred stockholders. Moreover, close inspection of Delaware case law highlights how such a dynamic is consistent with Delaware’s corporate jurisprudence which has historically viewed stockholder wealth maximization as ultimately a means to maximize the value of the corporation. To ensure the continuing vitality of the corporate form, Delaware courts should, accordingly, abandon any pretense that corporate directors have an immutable duty to maximize common stockholder value and revert to their traditional focus on policing against the bargaining failures that can occur when investors use directors to address the incomplete contracting challenges that are replete in corporate finance.",107.0,School Website,100,Goal 16,0.0154481722595755,False,

Stanford University professors conducted the primary research and we are building ties with other university researchers to support additional studies.

Our First Annual Survey of Latino Business Owners was conducted by Dr. Doug Rivers, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor of political science at Stanford University. Professor Doug Rivers is one of the world’s leading experts on survey research. He is also a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and has taught at Harvard University, Caltech, UCLA, and, most recently, Stanford University.

This report is based on three complementary data sources that help researchers, policymakers, and businesses understand the current generation of LOBs. The first is a meta database of 1,432,746 Latino businesses compiled from seven commercial databases. The second is a group of 1,861 Latino business owners who participated in our surveys. The third is modeled data that uses government surveys to calibrate and weight our panel data to estimate more representative results. Although we continue to improve and expand these data sources, they already provide breadth, depth, and improved accuracy for understanding this new economic force.

The survey panel is perhaps our most important resource for creating new knowledge around LOBs and the entrepreneurs who lead them. This panel, believed to be the largest statistically significant panel on LOBs ever created, provided the data for the majority of our analyses. The panel consists of Latino entrepreneurs who have been contacted by us, completed an initial interview, and agreed to participate in future research. Respondents were asked about many topics including their business’s industry, customer base, company size, age, ownership structure, sources of capital, and challenges.

In the first section of this reply, I argue that (a) establishing robust effects followed by a study of moderators, processes, and rivals, was the most effective approach given the field’s mission and audience, and (b) no single framework or theory can account for the many different ways in which the value maximization assumption is violated and decisions are made. Regarding the proposed next research program to study the interactions between the evolving information environment and consumer judgment and choice, both Lynch and Schwarz offer alternative hypotheses. Thus, for example, they both disagree with the suggestion that the ability to easily access more and better information tends to produce better decisions.

We argue this fact can be explained by looking at market categories from the producer perspective. Lenient market categories have more flexibility and allow for a wider range of fit. As a result, we expect there to be high rates of entry into lenient categories. At the same time, lenient market categories have drawbacks: they do not clearly convey what an organization does and do not identify specific sets of potential consumers. This means organizations are more likely to exit. When entry rates are higher than exit rates, lenient market categories will endure over time. We also predict that organizations exiting lenient categories will enter other lenient categories, further fueling the persistence of such categories. Finally, this trend is exaggerated when influential external agents favor leniency.
